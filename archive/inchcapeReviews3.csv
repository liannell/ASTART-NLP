12/7/17,5,Excellent service. The salesman was very friendly and the car was as described and competitively priced.
12/7/17,2,"BMW Croydon -Nice showroom and staff are pleasant BUT ......took car in to swap summer wheels for winter with prearranged appointment. Arrived late to collect car and still had to wait 45 minutes BUT WORSE was that it was released with tyre pressures of 28lbs,26lbs,25lbs and 27lbs. They should be 35/36lbs each !. The car warning light came up. Phoned next morning at 9.30am ,said they would call me back. Nothing. I called them back at 12.30when they admitted they were at fault. Bring the car back. NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
I remember when I bought the car that my criticism was that people never returned calls.....so nothing has changed there."
12/7/17,5,I have been buying cars and having them serviced by Inchcape VW for very many years. I have always found them to be first rate.
12/7/17,5,"Excellent service every time, car valeted, paperwork all ready when come to collect vehicle - no issues and will recommend"
12/7/17,4,"excellent service from Ellesmere Port branch ,"
12/7/17,5,"Great service and lovely people to deal with. They actually fitted two tyres cheaper than anyone else and fixed a puncture in a rear tyre. I was told its not possible to repair by a well known tyre company in Nottingham, who shall remain nameless."
12/7/17,5,"nothing too much trouble, very pleasing experience from start to finish."
12/7/17,4,"My car required a repair to a broken Tail Light, Software Update and a service. I dropped of the car and, during the day, I was provided with regular text progress updates. When I returned to pick up my car, I was advised that although the Software Update and Service were completed, the replacement Tail Light was received damaged and that a replacement was ordered. The Sales Assistant promptly arranged for my car to be picked the following day and repairs were completed. Although disappointing, the Sales Assistant and the Mechanics did a great job sorting out the problem and completing the repairs and the car was returned in clean condition."
12/7/17,5,Excellent service and a B service well done.
12/7/17,5,"Booked in for a service I turned up earlier than my appointment
No trouble
As I waited for the service to be done received a text message with a film from the technician explaining health check on the car
Car washed and vacuumed
Excellent service
Thank you Tony"
12/6/17,5,Great staff with great deals and prices. Makes your experience so much easy. Highly recommended. Excellent service provided by Martin in Sales team. Thanks for all the help !!
12/6/17,5,The Team at MB Coventry are amazing and always look after our Mercedes Benz. A Special Thanks to Mr Sunny Rakhra and Leanna both who always go out of there way to do a professional and friendly job on our cars. Keep up the fantastic work!
12/6/17,5,"Smart, attentive, helpful staff, very pleasant surroundings, complementary coffee and pastries - (and the coffee was very good, too!). Very helpful feedback concerning a recent accident repair, and a very competent service. Car was nicely washed and vacuumed, too. Great service, and great staff (Cars are EXCELLENT, too!!)"
12/6/17,5,Absolutely fantastic service by all staff. Thank you!
12/6/17,5,I would like to thank Ellie Farrell for her help with my recent visit. She was very professional in everything she did for me and is an asset to Cooper BMW. Whilst there was a few issues in receiving the part required she was upfront and honest with the problem and got it sorted for me. Thanks again.
12/6/17,4,"Winter health check and car valet carried out on my Mercedes C200 at Stratford on 5/12/2017. Greeting by reception excellent, all work completed quickly on time and car returned in clean condition. However I have the following comments:
1. I was advised there were no problems identified during the check but the quality documentation stated the wipers were smearing the screen and had a red warning highlighter. I was advised it was not drawn to my attention as it was a standard statement on every report! I now have to make a return journey to Stratford to get new wipers fitted.
2. Car valet does not include cleaning the rear boot space."
12/6/17,5,Really well looked after and the updates and communication was excellent. I felt really well looked after all the way through. A special mention to Gabrielle who had such patience and calmness - first class.
12/6/17,4,"great service, felt well taken care of - only reason it's not a 5 star is that it did take quite a bit longer for the work to be carried out"
12/6/17,5,My C220 CDi was serviced and MOT tested without any problems and the car was ready for collection at the time specified. The car was washed and presented to me looking immaculate.
12/6/17,5,Very friendly staff and make feel welcome and fast services thank you
12/6/17,5,Annual service completed on time and as booked. Car nice and clean when picked up after service. Service rep. was very helpful.
12/6/17,5,"Once again the service from Inchcape Cheshire Oaks was outstanding.
From dropping off my car to picking it up I was kept aware of all issues,costs and how to proceed. The service and small repairs where carried out within the estimated time frame.
Phil who looked after me from the service team could not have been any more attentive, as are all the staff I have dealt with. A pleasure to deal with.
Thank you all."
12/6/17,4,"This was my first experience of a Mercedes Benz service. The process and the people were very friendly, as you would of course expect. They sent a video of the under-car inspection which was a nice touch, though loses a point because the background music drowned out what the mechanic was saying some of the time. Of course you pay for the quality of service, but it was good to be quoted a price that was stuck to and didn't find myself e.g. paying a fiver to have the windscreen washer fluid topped up, even though I'd done it the week before. I'd also rather have the ""free"" wash and vacuum as a priced option, as it's of course in the price somewhere.

Now I'm out of warranty, do I stick with MB, or go to a local specialist? Still working that one out tbh, but this was a decent start."
12/6/17,5,Efficient and liked the video showing our car service.
12/6/17,5,"Extremely rare to get such excellent service. Faultless in every way from solving problems to ensure the car passed MOT to servicing with clear communication of things to look out for.
Definitely no hesitation in recommending."
12/6/17,5,"I got the car I wanted with excellent, attentive service"
12/6/17,3,"very good, only minor issues my seat and steering wheel had been adjusted in every possible way? Locking nuts were left on the seat not put back in the boot, and the inside had not been cleaned properly."
12/6/17,5,"We left our car for service on 5/12/2017 and immediately found that the staff were not only extremely helpful but very efficient. The car was ready for the time we requested and Sharon had all the documentation ready when we arrived. She in particular was exceptional in the way we were dealt with.
Highly recommended."
12/6/17,5,"The timing was as expected & the staff I met were very good & helpful.
Thank you for some excellent service.
Eric Harris."
12/6/17,5,"Audi Q3 service seemed a bit pricey to be honest, I mentioned this when I delivered the car yesterday morning and I was told that it would be looked at. When I collected the car a few hours later 15% had been deducted. Great service by Audi Swindon, thanks."
12/6/17,5,"Cooper BMW Norwich. Took my 3 series estate in for first service on Wed 06 Dec 2017. Prompt, friendly and efficient service."
12/6/17,5,"The team are excellent!

Had a great experience when choosing our mini. Great showroom with first class sales service.

Thank you, Andy and the team."
12/6/17,5,Staff very friendly and helpful. I was made to feel very welcome at all times. Servicing of my vehicle was fully explained with quotation. No pressure was made to accept the quote. When the work was carried out and the vehicle was returned having been valeted inside and out. All very much appreciated.
12/6/17,5,Car went in for a national recall. Quick and efficient.
12/6/17,5,"I am extremely satisfied the service which I recieved. I found the staff very friendly, and curtios. I would seriosely recomend that branch for Customer Satisfaction!!"
12/6/17,5,"We came to Tetbury to purchase a 2014 Audi A1 and part exchange my Mercedes SLK. Audi Tetbury is a very smart dealership with very friendly staff. We were looked after by Will, nice guy, who took care of all the paperwork very efficiently. I was shown round the A1 which I had previously seen on the web site. It was immaculate. My husband John had an enjoyable test drive, while I had a second coffee and biscuits. . The transfer went off without a hitch and we drove away feeling very happy. A big thank you to Will and all the staff"
12/6/17,5,Excellent quick and friendly service from the parts counter.
12/6/17,5,"Excellent service provided by all staff from booking car into service and reception, tchnicians doing the car I would give 10/10 for first class service.

STEVE Beswick."
12/6/17,3,"This is the third time I have booked in for a service and requested a courtesy car well in advance.
This is the third time I have had issues with the allocation of a courtesy car. The same excuse offered every time “ a customer has not returned the courtesy car”
Not convinced, a really poor customer experience in this regard."
12/6/17,5,"Interim service, on time.
Appropriate heads-up on future wear & tear areas.
Loan car available as booked on-line.
First rate service from Paul Riddett as usual.
Car covered in usual winter grime but shiny clean on pick-up."
12/6/17,3,"Excellent service and pleasant friendly staff plus a much needed car wash thrown in for free.

However, don't fall for their ruse to try and get £15 out of you for use of a courtesy car. They ask you to bring your driving licence with you but conveniently omit to tell you to bring your insurance certificate. Without it, you have no option but to take out their £15 insurance. It's a bit of a scam really - whether intentional or not I don't know.

You have been warned!"
12/6/17,5,"great service, from the experts."
12/6/17,1,Recently had my service booked with the coventry Mercedes branch was told i would have a free life check of the car and it would be a express service no longer then 1hr 30mins. But it took over 3 hrs to get back to me and no report was sent to me (normally a video sent to my email or phone) so not sure what exactly i paid for. Wont be using them again rude staff and never kept informed!
12/6/17,5,Excellent coverage from start to finish. From the reception to pick up I cannot fault the service
12/6/17,5,"Always very helpful!
I have had 2 cars from Volkswagen Chelmsford and I have always had a great service."
12/6/17,5,Great Customer service and speedy response to my infotainment problem.
12/6/17,5,"The first year service on my C Class Convertible was carried out efficiently & promptly.
Specail mention to Jack Williams of MB Stratford for his courteous & efficient service. Nothing was too much trouble and the car was ready for collection on time. My nearest MB dealership is MB Leicester but having visited both showrooms I would not hesitate to recommend MB Stratford for sales & service - well done."
12/6/17,5,Excellent service and very helpful staff.
12/6/17,5,I had 2 new tyres fitted at Inchcape. The service and advice I received from John was exceptional. My car was also cleaned and vacuumed out. I will be returning in the future.
12/6/17,5,"Great support by the dealer Jon, very professional and great customer service, we will return. Thanks guys."
12/6/17,5,"Great service. Telephone to book, listed items wanted serviced when I got there all those items had been detailed on paperwork no need to repeat. Jobs done promptly and to high quality. Picked up a cleaner car and running smother. Top marks thank you"
12/6/17,5,My experience both before and after purchase has been brilliant. I dealt mainly with Nadia and Ben and I would not hesitate to recommend them and Mini Cobham.
12/6/17,2,"This dealership doe's not communicate between departments. Assured car was serviced in April 2017 when purchased, stamp in book, but transpires that salesman got it wrong, service not done but illegal stamp in service book. I had phoned previously over this issue as VW kept emailing me to say the car required a service, to be assured by the salesman that the car had been serviced and not to worry. So what turned out to be a quick Brake Fluid change turned into a service as well. To be fair the service was free but doe's not distract from the facts that this dealership is poor with its documentation and communication."
12/6/17,5,"Helpful professional staff, excellent service"
12/5/17,5,very friendly helpful service every time
12/5/17,2,"I took my car for MOT and service I did mentioned that left corner light is not working and was told it will be checked. when collected the car the same message appears again that left corner light is not working. I thought one of the things they do for MOT is checking all the lights.

Staff are very nice and friendly"
12/5/17,5,"I recently purchased a 1 series BMW from Coopers in Norwich, I cant thank Michael enough. From buying the car to collecting it the service was excellent - I purchased the car late on a Friday afternoon and it was ready to collect by the Monday! I would strongly recommend!!"
12/5/17,5,"All went exactly as it should have done and even better when they finished my service early
Could not fault them"
12/5/17,5,"Excellent experience, great coffee!
Even the man cleaning the cars was friendly and helpful
Service reception as usual were welcoming and helpful"
12/5/17,5,Superb service I rang the dealer on Friday and my car was booked in on Monday completed by the afternoon and vehicle was also valeted. The Service Advisor went through the work carried out and the VHC was fully explained. 10 out of10 Lexus Derby.
12/5/17,5,"Having use Cooper Mini York for the last 9 years for purchasing & servicing cars, i would have no hesitation in recommending them."
12/5/17,2,My phone calls were never returned. By accident i learned that my car (4 months old) was subject to a recall.
12/5/17,5,Good service.
12/5/17,5,"I was seen promptly at the agreed time of arrival. I had changed my mind about leaving the car all day and would have liked back sooner although offered that I had made a mistake on the booking. While we were looking at other cars, the assistant came over and mentioned that a cancellation had allowed them to look at the car immediately and return it within a couple of hours. Perfect - and lucky."
12/5/17,5,"Excellent service as always. Every time I visit the showroom I am treat with courtesy and integrity. Who can ask for more.
All work was carried out and even a video was sent of the inspection.
Many thanks."
12/5/17,5,Excellent customer service all round. Staff could not have been more helpful.
12/5/17,4,Martin was very helpful on what was clearly a busy day for the service Dept. Thought my bill was reasonable so perfectly happy.

12/5/17,5,Excellent quick service with polite staff
12/5/17,5,"Excellent service all round, collected car in the morning , phone call during the day, with update of progress of work. Also received . e-mail containing video of our car on the ramp and the Technician showing us round the car and pointing out any problems. VERY PROFESSIONAL . Car delivered back at end of the day after wash and vacuum."
12/5/17,5,Excellent throughout!
12/5/17,5,Did what they promised. Impressive hire car. Vehicle washed and hoovered.. I like the fixed price idea.
12/5/17,5,"From the moment I arrived to leaving.
The staff were welcoming and, courteous and most helpful.
What would take place was explained.
Whilst waiting I had coffee.
I was sent a video of the examination of my car, with points to notice regarding tyres, windscreen wipers etc.
The work undertaken was completed and and car also cleaned.
I have no hesitation in recommending Coopers Motors.

12/5/17,5,"Excellent and courteous service, emailed a video of the visual vehicle health check and pointed out other areas that might need intervention. A very good service from start to finish."
12/5/17,4,"Could not park very easily. Was told it would take about an hour to winter check and vac and clean. I was waiting 2 hours.
Although I am keen to have my car serviced and checked by Mercedes I found it very difficult to drive from here as I am new to the area.



I"
12/5/17,5,Excellent service as always
12/5/17,5,"Had problems with a flat battery. Thought a new battery was needed. Booked a battery check and fitment of new battery if required. Got prompt attention and was told the battery was in good order, a full charge would solve the problem. The lady I dealt with was most helpful, friendly and polite. The service I received was at no cost."
12/5/17,5,"I have an old Audi and recently had a major service & cam belt change, from this I was offered a free MOT for the rest of the cars life and accepted, passed MOT with no reported faults, my car was washed and hoovered beautifully and it didn’t cost me a penny, there was even a lovely cup of coffee, I waited ijust over an hour and my car was ready. Very efficient and friendly service 😃"
12/5/17,1,"Shocking service through and through at Cheltenham.
Having purchased a BRAND NEW Golf earlier this year, I've had a series of issues including catastrophic failure of an ECU and now ongoing issues with the clutch, I'm having to fight to get them to do anything about it - I have to do all the chasing to make anything happen, I've been LIED TO by one of their service managers about what he'd said could be done after the last lot of issues and to be perfectly honest, if I could, I would ask for all my money back as it's daylight robbery. Don't bother going here if you expect a company with ANY integrity."
12/5/17,5,Excellent customer service and communication
12/5/17,5,"Good communication , kept me informed regarding costs, could not fault."
12/5/17,2,"BMW Service.

Despite expressly telling the assistant I needed the car by 4pm when I dropped it off at 8.30am, I was called at 15.59 to be told that the service had just been started and I should come and pick it up between 5-5.30. No apology or explanation. Not impressed."
12/5/17,5,Excellent service from the two James’ at Customer Service desk also thanks to Kate at reception. H.A.Fox have certainly raised their profile.
12/5/17,5,"Excellent service. Promot, kept informed. Ready as advised.
This is for Mercedes Pride Park, Derby."
12/5/17,5,Service carried out efficiently and quickly. Cannot fault it.
12/5/17,5,Went out of their way to sort out the problem with my car. Very efficient and not as expensive as I expected for a full franchise dealer.
12/5/17,4,"Sorry to say I was not very happy
1) I have left my car for service Also wheels balance and alignment
I have been told should be ready between 17:00-18:00hrs that was fine I have had three phone calls to tell me progress of the work

So I had to returned home waited till the next day to get my car
2) the car I have been given for curtesy car is discras dirty from outside and inside the back seat full of squashed crisps...."
12/5/17,5,"Always go the extra mile, fantastic to deal with. Nice upstairs business lounge to wait in. Free courtesy car always available if booked in advance (decent car given as well). Had many services etc here any couldn't fault any."
12/5/17,5,"Seamless service. Thorough, quality and friendly."
12/5/17,4,Had first oil change for my TTS yesterday . Total cost £243. Was asked if I wanted a quote on arrival but refused it. Have not had this question before. Job cost was £77.43 and oil cost £13.99 but disposal of oil charge £87 ! I find this amazing and something of a rip off. Car has only done just over 9K and 14 months old.
12/5/17,5,Excellent in every aspect.
12/5/17,5,"Very pleasant experience, staff very polite and friendly, couldn't do enough for you. Professional service, can't fault it, my car was ready ahead of time and the complimentary vehicle health check video is a great little extra."
12/5/17,5,Great service and reasonable price.
12/5/17,5,"My recent experience of having my car serviced at MB of Warrington deserves a five star rating. I found the attentive way I was treated refreshing and the requests I had made were all attended to on the day.
I chose to have a loan vehicle while mine was in for service and this was duly provided. Before I left the dealership I was advised that a video inspection of my vehicle would be sent to my email address. It was, and it was an honest appreciation of the underside mechanical state of my car. Outside of the service I had my two rear tyres replaced, a new fuel filler cap fitted - because I managed to snap the tethering cord, and my rear number plate replaced - looking a bit weathered.
I received notification from the dealership when my car was ready and at the handover was taken through the service done and the additional items. The car had received a complimentary wash and vacuum after it’s service so all in all I was very happy with the work done and the customer service extended to me."
12/5/17,5,Great customer service all round. Work carried out efficiently. Car looked like new after valet.
12/4/17,5,Excellent customer service. Left feeling extremely satisfied that all issues had been resolved.
12/4/17,5,Excellent Service and very friendly staff - Thank you very much!
12/2/17,5,"The before, during and after service has been amazing. Everyone there works as a team and they really make the customer feel unique. Fabulous guys and a beautiful car! Thanks Steve, Alan and Chris."
12/2/17,5,As usual first class and very nice welcome from you front desk
12/2/17,3,"This dealer doesn't really do anything badly but it doesn't excel either.
You get a friendly greeting from a resident elderly gentleman on arrival, there is a free vend drinks machine and its easy to access the dealer as its close to the A12. But parking is limited, the waiting area is only adequate and the 'service' experience is ordinary.
I visited twice in the last two weeks and both times I was tested in finding a parking space. More of a concern is that the advice / information / quality I get from the servicing department isn't exceptional. As an example I left after my first visit being told my front tyres were all ok (although I knew they had uneven wear and mentioned it) and on my next visit a week later (I was back as two new wheels were needed under warranty that had to be ordered in) I was told my tyres were a bit of a concern!!! And on this second visit the wrong wheels were first fitted with my tyres and only when they wouldn't go on my car was it evident they were the wrong ones, in fairness they were apparently the same style but surely a BMW technician would have checked the wheel size first! Then when I did leave i noticed one of the caps on my TPM valves was missing and I had to go back in to the service department to report it. I expect better from BMW. So as I say, it does ok but its not what I regard as BMW quality or the experience I would expect from a premium brand."
12/2/17,5,Excellent- very nice staff and manager. I’m enjoying my new car. Thank you Denil
12/1/17,5,"Amazing service received from Roddy at Cooper BW Croydon, took my 435 for minor checks. Exemplary service , Thank you"
12/1/17,1,"I took my car into the Coventry branch for a routine service on 27/11/17. The staff all seemed pleasent enough but the overall customer service was somewhat underwhelming.

The courtesy car fuel warning light was on red straight away. With my destination only 14 miles away I thought I would get there and then put some fuel in on the way back. It doesn't seem unrealistic to me to assume that they had left at least 30 miles of fuel in the tank. However, half way on my return journey the car completely ran out of fuel. Luckily I was only 500 yards away from a petrol station. I managed to move the car off of the road but didn't quite make it to a car parking space. I ran over to the garage, bought a jerry can, filled it up and ran back over to the car.

Rather disgruntled at this point I made it back to the dealership and explained to the lady what had happened. She sympathised with me but couldn't really offer any sort of complimentaries. Whether or not she passed the message on to her superiors is anyone's guess.

Mercedes Benz make world class cars. However, with my recent experience at Inchape Coventry, I am unsure whether I would purchase another Merc in the future."
12/1/17,1,"Having booked my wife's with this dealership because they were able to offer a ""better"" service than the local dealer I am so far hugely disappointed and regret the decision.
We have booked a routine service and understand that this will ordinarily work its way through the sausage machine in its own good time but when trying to contact the person ""looking after"" our car today I have so far drawn a blank. I've left a couple of messages and called 4 times now only to be told that he is ""just away from his desk"" or ""with a customer"". And of course no-one else is available to talk to me either.
I was informed on the last call that he would be ""with others customers"" for some time and at least half an hour. These other customers are ""walk-ins"" from what I was told.
Tell me, why should they have priority and why should I have to wait for there to be a lull in activity before I get to talk to anyone?
Apart from the fact the poor woman on the phone had to put up with me ranting at her, this is a waste of her time and absolutely absurd.
My wife needs to unexpectedly leave early to get our daughter from nursery - not the dealerships issue I agree but to not even be able to talk to someone to get a progress update and see if anything could be done is unforgivable.
So having called again around 2 hours after first calling and being told an ""urgent"" message has been sent out to all staff to call me as soon as someone becomes free I'm sat here 3 hours after making my first call. I try again. This time no-one answers and the line goes dead.I try again and eventually someone answers. I am greeted with a tone a recognition and this time my contact is going immediately back to his desk. I ask has he spoken to my wife to which I get a confused response to say that he hadn't heard anything and should he have.
He claims that he has had NO messages, even checked the system and NOTHING on there!
Someone is not telling the truth here folks.
Anyway turns out that they are waiting for a ""master technician"" for our car - everyone else must be getting the standard treatment but because of this it hasn't even gone into the workshop yet but its OK because it is next! I’m reassured that it will be done as quickly as possible and should be back by half five.
Half five comes and goes but no sign of the car and NO call. I call them again but it rings out. Try again and another poor lady had to endure my rath but speaks to the service manager who promises a call back in 10 minutes. I wait.
25 minutes later I call back and am told all management have left for the day but I can speak to our contact who is looking after us. I ask him where my car is and he says he just got the paperwork. I ask why he hasn’t had the decency to call me and update me since it wasn’t completed when he said but I’m told he was busy with other customers. Lucky them.
I can’t really find the words at this point but let’s just say I’m less than amused. We then speak to a senior advisor who agrees the car can be released and returned to my wife, who is still at work waiting for the car!
Not a single proactive outbound call to me the customer. Not a single promise was met.
Perhaps they have too much work so think it’s ok to treat customers this way or perhaps they are just incompetent. I dont know but my advice would be to go elsewhere and not try to find out for yourself.
Inchcape Group you should be ashamed!"
12/1/17,2,"Audi A5 Interim Service, Brake Fluid, Air Con Service and Tyres @ Crawley Audi.

Went to pick-up my A5 in the evening after a long day at work as agreed only to realise that the wrong tyres had been fitted. Despite explicit instructions about wanting the same tyres as fitted on rear axle (Pirelli P-Zero) I found myself arguing with the Customer Agent about her telling me off that Pirelli P-Zero 'Rosso' are the ones fitted on my car, at the back - fairly convenient since these are the ones Audi had fitted at the front.

Of course, after telling her 4 times(!) in the showroom that she was wrong, we went outside to check my car and oh, surprise surprise! here she was red-faced and confused.

No other choice than to come back the next evening, again (with an extra 30 miles travelling done, here) to argue with her again about the amount of diesel left in the tank. Bearing in mind I had already topped it up the evening before as expected (thinking I'd pick-up my car and go) I didn't do so the next evening after their mistakes and all extra miles and time and inconvenience etc..etc..

Fair to say that at this stage I was pretty fuming to say the least and got to speak to the supposedly Customer Care Manager; who was an absolute delight. Not. Sitting down in front of me with a long face she clearly thought of herself as a self-important person. No apologies and literally couldn't have been less clued-up about what providing top customer service entails. An absolute waste of space also challenging and upping an argumentative situation in the middle of their showroom.

The most beautiful part of this is that I had already dealt with her a year or so ago when she was herself only a Customer Agent - she had messed up one of my services and I had, at the time, had to raise a complaint about her.

Two things are certain here: 1/ I was foolish to ever trust them again after my first complaint; 2/ I'm done with Audi Crawley and that's that.
What an absolute and total shambolic customer experience.

You've now been truly advised & warned!"
12/1/17,5,"The service from start to end was faultless. The extras, attention to detail and personal attention go a very long way and put a smile on your face. The whole process is at the top of being the best service I’ve had."
11/30/17,4,"Friendly and helpful, you just have to carefully check the paperwork to ensure it reflects the promises made."
11/30/17,3,"The only part I can criticise would be returning to my car after a wash to such a state. My paperwork/presentation that was on the OSR seat was thrown across the whole back seat, crumpled and unusable for a meeting I had later that day, the NSR foot mat wasn't even put back, just pulled up and left. The drivers foot mat wasn't secured or retuned in the correct position which became wedged under the clutch pedal halfway down the road.... Its all about the little things in life, it has been on my mind since, not impressed."
11/30/17,5,Salesman (Ian O’Shea) listened to what was required and delivered to us what was needed. Clear sales language and had the information to hand when questions were asked. After sales call was received.

11/30/17,1,"Oh dear, I bought my wife a new Disco Sport in March, from the King's Lynn branch. I developed an electrical fault which immobilised the vehicle and the dashboard was the proverbial disco itself, we were recovered from the motorway, it was checked out and no fault found, even though the AA man had 66 faults showing on the A can. the fault happen again and it went back to the Kings Lynn workshop again no fault found, the very next morning after only 5miles had been driven the fault happened yet again propelling my wife through a red traffic light, that was two months ago. I have rejected the car since, and am waiting for a replacement, but that was two weeks ago and no news. It is not beyond the wit of man to act in an expedient and professional manor to sort this issue out. 1 The car is dangerous. 2 They don't know how to fix it. 3 No one seems to have any concern for the customer.
Having been without my car for two months, and having rejected it two weeks ago I would expect the replacement date by now"
11/30/17,5,"Good Service. Prompt, helpful, no excessive pressure to take additional products."
11/30/17,5,"I had a fantastic experience on the 28th November 2017. I took my car in for an update and the two guys dealing with myself and the car were fantastic, they went above and beyond for me and made my day. I will be recommending them (paul g and Paul s ) I think . Thanks guys"
11/30/17,1,"Bad first experience with inchape Toyota ( derby )
I have recently relocated to derby and thought it makes sense if I service my Toyota in derby .
The process itself was ok / straightforward and my car has passed the MOT straight away .
On my first drive after the service I started to hear a heavy noise from the car . 2 days later , I was called for feedback and I mentioned that and I was told someone will call me back . That never happened .
I called myself today and I have spoken to Simon ( service advisor ) who mentioned like 5 times that there might be a diagnostic charge of 66 pounds ... really ? My car just passed the MOT and was serviced and costed me more than 300 pounds ( if I remember correctly ) . Anyway the earliest he can send his driver to pick up the car would be Thursday and guess what , anytime between 8-12 .. he wants me to take a day off just to wait for the driver to pick up my car . That wasn’t the case the first time . When I was told the driver will call me the day before to set a time .( which has happened )
Clearly Simon wasn’t interested to help or willing to engage and find solutions ( his final
Reply was ... sorry it’s our policy )
So disappointed by the service .. not impressed at all and currently I am in the process to put a formal complain.
**** update***
I had the chance to discuss the issue with the derby branch and apparently SIMON , the guy I spoke with initially is located in the call entre and not at derby branch . My initial complaint was against the way Simon dealt with the issue .
they will kindly collect my car on Tuesday ! Further updates on Tuesday ..."
11/30/17,5,Excellent service provided. Efficient service in collection and service of the car. Very professional method of reporting and communication of the work carried out and the condition of the car
11/30/17,1,An absolute nightmare and very distressing to drive away in your new car feeling dissatisfied and stressed I'm sure is not the correct protocol... A complaint has been lodged
11/30/17,5,Very prompt and helpful would recommend for service department had my mot. Staff are very friendly.
11/30/17,5,Excellent staff and service plus a nice environment in the new showroom.
11/29/17,3,"The booking arrangements for my MOT and service were managed professionally making it very easy to plan in advance around my job. I arranged for a courtesy car and explained that an Aygo (which I had been given the previous year) would not be appropriate as I carry bulky equipment for my job. I was offered a Yaris as this was the only other option. Still small but I thought i could manage.
On the day of the service I was shown to the courtesy car, firstly it was an automatic, where mine is manual. I have driven an automatic years previously so although slightly nervous I did take the car. However, on testing the brakes found them to be extremely sensitive, to the point that I was unable to drive the vehicle safely. I drove a short distance in the Yaris, but felt the sensitivity of the brakes made it dangerous so turned back. Anthony, was extremely helpful in finding me another vehicle very quickly, unfortunately the only one available was an Aygo, which I had specifically said would not be suitable because of my job.
I do feel the Yaris was not suitable for the needs of a manual gear shift driver unused to automatic and unused to driving different vehicles, and as an experienced driver do feel the sensitivity of the brakes was far too extreme.
I was late for work, stressed and felt that despite early booking, my needs were not catered for.
When I arrived to collect the car, the work undertaken was fed back to me, unfortunately the gentleman that was sorting this out was unable to tell me if the front tyres had been resealed as i requested. There was no record of it being done and no one was able to confirm either way. I was informed i would be called the following day by Anthony to let me know if the re-seal had been undertaken. I didnt hear from Anthony. I'm sure I'll find out when my tyres deflate!.
All in all, as a loyal customer, I felt that despite the professionalism of the team as a whole my experience this year left me feeling stressed, unsatisfied and late for work."
11/29/17,5,Great experience - good communications and friendly pleasant staff.
11/29/17,5,"In the past I have always felt that staff were not interested in the customers in fact I have walked out after waiting for over 15 minutes to be seen. This time however was different, someone has got hold of the staff training and turned things around. It was a pleasure to be there."
11/29/17,5,Excellent in all aspects. Thank you such a positive experience.
11/29/17,5,"Mini york have looked after our family now for a good 8 years maybe! I personally have always delt with different sales people each time but that has never bothered me, This time Adam was great, really professional and it felt like he really wanted to get us the right deal for our family. He wasn’t pushy(which I hate) and he didn’t pressure us into anything, even when it took us ages to decide whether it was a good idea to upgrade! He let us hash it out.
You always feel looked after once you’ve left and you always feel like they personalise your experience. A really, really great team."
11/29/17,5,Good service

11/29/17,1,"Not that impressed with customer service innthis occasion . Had a problem with a locking wheel that not coming off took the car into local dealer purchased new wheel nuts but thought they would have changed the wheel I was having problems with while they removed the problem nut , it would have taken them 2 mins with all the specialised equipment but they didn’t and told me I would have to book an appointment, clearly not easy to return for a 2 minute Job which they could ah easily done ! It took more time to tell me and explain why the didn’t do it !"
11/29/17,5,"Good honest service. Everything done as requested, car returned spotless. Got to the bottom of an ongoing fault other garages couldn’t diagnose. Excellent customer service from the word go right through to collecting the car after two days. Realistically charged and no pressure in up selling parts not required."
11/29/17,3,"Collection of the car let the overall rating down. Advised the car would be collected before 10am. Collection happened at 10.15am.

11/29/17,5,Great speedy service. Excellent coffee while MOT and car clean carried out. Highly recommended.
11/29/17,3,"Finally Mercedes have realised that there are women who can afford to buy their cars.
The female Receptionist and The lady in charge of the admin were superb. Much better than the men I have experienced in this role in your Birkdale show room"
11/29/17,5,"Whilst I was, admittedly, a fish in a barrel as I already knew what I wanted; the service from CooperBMW was absolutely excellent. I dealt with Nuala and Chris and both were fantastic. It was the first time I had purchased a new car and I was put at ease by Nuala straight away. The level of updates I received throughout the process was good and even when the news wasn't what I hoped for (factory delay), Nuala was honest and let me know at the earliest opportunity. I feel like I got a very competitive deal and cannot fault the service I received throughout. I would happily recommend CooperBMW."

11/29/17,1,"Bought used bmw in mid Sept and was only given one key with promise second would be supplied. Despite several phone calls, visit to the dealership and given very polite excuses and apologies I just cannot get anyone from here to sort it out or let me know what is the current situation.
From my experience of this dealerships customer service after they have got your money, it is a long way short of what I would expect from a bmw dealership and certainly would not use them again."
11/29/17,5,Always very helpful staff and efficient service.
11/29/17,5,Excellent service for my car and myself
11/29/17,5,"I found that inchcape service to be exceptional starting with the young lady at the reception desk and then the service staff.

11/29/17,5,"From walking into the showroom on my first visit to picking up my new car the whole experience was fantastic.

I had a meeting with Huw Roberts, then Huw introduced me to Scott Clayton sales executive.
The professional approach from Huw and Scott I have to say was exemplary.

They are a credit to Audi Stockport.

From the text drive to picking up my car was only a matter of days.
I can say quite honestly Audi Stockport is a first class Dealership.

10 out of 10 Guys"

11/28/17,5,Good quick exchange of vehicles and completion of paperwork. Small mark noticed on interior was quickly resolved by the salesman at handover.
11/28/17,5,"An excellent buying experience at Cooper BMW in York. I felt the team had an interest in understanding what I wanted and then doing their best to help me find the right car. I didn't find the conversations pushy or rushed in any way. Communication has been excellent throughout the process.

Just three weeks after ordering the car it has arrived as the team was able to find me a really great specification car which had just finished production but wasn't allocated to a customer.

I will be recommending Cooper York to friends and family."
11/28/17,5,No problems timings good.

11/28/17,5,Professional and responsive. Excellent service. Thank you.
11/28/17,3,"Ok experience - arrived on spec on the morning asked to com back at 4 o’c. Came back at designated time, waited around 10 mins to be seen, took 20 mins to be informed of the fault (fairly straight forward as there was a warning light!) Then took 30 mins to change a bulb.
Overall experience ok, but it cost £90 - which feels very expensive to fix one bulb. Finally, e-mail inviting me to give feedback was a ‘Mr’ then a female name - but odd!"
11/28/17,5,very professional helpful staff
11/28/17,5,"Good advice, excellent service."
11/28/17,5,"Phoned service on Friday for a service and MOT, took my B Class in on the following Monday, jog was completed by 11.30AM. High class customer service"

11/28/17,4,Good efficient service
11/28/17,5,"Took my Toyota Auris for a charcoal canister recall at Kidlington.

Apart from the charcoal canister change, they did a free visual overall check and thankfully highlighted that my front brakes and one indicator needed changing. I did notice when I was braking but having that second opinion prompted us to get it changed.

I also picked up the courtesy car when I dropped our car. Brand new Yaris. Great to have the opportunity to try the new car. Pick up and delivery was quick and efficient.

From booking to picking up my car the whole experience was great. Great staff at all times (phone and face to face). Courteous, efficient, helpful and friendly. Highly recommended. Natalie who I dealt with was great. She explained things very well and made the whole process smooth. Keep it up!"
11/28/17,5,"Excellent service as always, from Zoe, Jonathan and John the Manager, top quality service from top quality people."
11/28/17,1,"So, on booking my car in I received an email introducing me to the new VIP Audi experience and telling me what to expect - digital display directing me to an allocated parking space, service representative meeting me at my car etc. Suffice to say that nothing like this happened.

Having arrived and sorted myself out, I had booked to wait (up to 2.5 hours) and wasn't shown to the waiting area, wasn't offered a drink or shown where to get one and was left feeling pretty abandoned. After around an hour I received a text outlining that my car needed some work - a new cambelt at £650, recommended a 48 months or 75,000 miles, although my car is 2 years old and has covered around 8,000 miles. When I approached the service representative to ask why I had received a text and not been approached, she said, 'sorry, I didn't know you were here'!!! She also couldn't explain why the work had been recommended and told me to 'just ignore the message'.

The usual post-service call came from Swindon Audi's contact centre and when I outlined my experience, the lady who called apologised and aid she would get the Service Manager to contact me - no call received as yet, and my husband is still waiting for a call from the same Service Manager having experienced problems last August, so I'm not holding my breath!

All in all a massive disappointment. This isn't just confined to me as my husband is far from impressed with the service he received and we are seriously considering whether the excellent Audi cars are worth the hassle from the Dealer."
11/28/17,5,Faultless service throughout
11/28/17,5,Went to swap summer for winter tyres - excellent customer service.
11/28/17,5,"Such a great experience, I’ve never financed a car before due to hearing it’s a lot of hassle etc. I couldn’t have had it made easier enough, I had a woman called Kayleigh who helped me find the perfect car, great employee much recommended. Pleasure doing business with a great person and great company."
11/28/17,4,"Really good reception at dealer's. Rapid and attentive staff interface. Communication and feedback well covered (inspection video sent: slow to perform- the 40 secs took 4 mins to see to conclusion).
Collected car at agreed time. Well pleased."
11/28/17,5,"I could not fault any aspect of the service which I received .
Warm /friendly greeting with helpful staff .
Lee offered impartial advice on a number of issues and had a good knowledge of the issues discussed .
Peter Glover ."
11/28/17,2,On Monday 27/11 my Mercedes my car needed a retrofit fuse on current limiter as received a recall letter a week earlier. Whilst I was happy to wait in the dealership for an hour and a half I expected my car to be at least cleaned on the outside and possibly a valet for the inconvenience - neither of these things happened which left me quite disappointed. Did contact Mercedes Customer Service who just send they would provide feedback to all dealerships.
11/28/17,2,"The service team were very good dealing with my warrantee claims. Its just such a shame they were let down so badly by the sales person who originally sold the car to us.

I left many messages for him regarding an issue with a part that needed replacing. he kept promising to return my calls but didn't. After several weeks of leaving messages for him, the service team liaised with him and resolved the issue.

I would also mention that during the purchase of the car, we had to chase him constantly as he again didn't return call or respond to emails.

I would also mention that he promised us a Mercedes umbrella on ordering the car 2.5 months ago, despite several requests, this umbrella still hasn't arrived.

For such a high price product, I would expect much better service from Mercedes!"
11/28/17,5,"Pre ordered parts that were ready for day of service. Well managed setup. Andre on the desk was very helpful and the mechanic went out for a test drive when i arrived so I could explain the noise the car was making.

Competentcy is rare these days. This team has it."
11/28/17,3,"I arrived at VW Twickenham for a service and an asked them to look at my seat belt as it was jamming . There was confusion as they had mixed me up with another customer with a similar name .When I returned to collect my car the service person said that I needed a new seat belt the cost would be £400 + vat and + labour (the a is only a few years old ) so was supposed that a safety featcher would go so soon . I disided to go back to the show room l purchased the car from as l drove down on the M3 the tyre pressure light came on ! . The manager of the work shop checked the car over and agreed that I did need a new belt the price of the belt was £183 ,NOT£400 and that my tyres had been BADLEY over inflated . He didn’t under stand the cost given to me by the twickenham branch as they hadn’t created a job card also they didn’t ask if I had a warrantie . I have emailed the Twickenham branch 2 weeks ago to ask why the descripancey but NO reply why am I not surprised my advice would be don’t use this garage I won’t"
11/28/17,5,Excellent service and very good coffee
11/28/17,5,"Great help from Swindon. Call backs, info, appearance of garage and staff. Will buy again from them!!"

11/28/17,5,"Everytime I have been to Inchcape Bolton I have had excellent service. Before I got my car last year, my partner and I went to pretty much every Volkswagen in the North West (we don't live near Bolton) as we didn't have a very good experience until we went to the one at Bolton as a last resort as it is out of our way. However I am really glad we did and will always make the trip to Bolton for my car! And my Husband has also recently got his car from there too!"
11/28/17,1,"Thank you for your standard reply. I will be writing a full report of this service and will send it to both your head office and also to Hunters at Norwich where this ‘Service’ took place.
I will say the support received from Andy in Servicing was excellent."

11/27/17,5,Great customer service and advice in buying a new car. The vehicle is great as well!!!
11/27/17,5,"I'd been slightly disappointed with a previous experience at Lexus Derby after many years of outstanding service, so I was predisposed to be slightly critical.

I shouldn't have been. Service staff and receptionist were the soul of professionalism, courteous and helpful.

The job itself (recall for a non-Lexus airbag component) was completed efficiently, with a visual inspection, car-wash and £25 fuel top up for my trouble.

A return to exceptional form."
11/27/17,5,"booked a service one week prior to date, also arranged courtesy car, dropped off vehicle at 8.30am ready by 4.30pm same day, no problems, all done and dusted without fuss......"
11/27/17,5,"Good service and helpful salesperson,nothing was to much trouble,patient and understanding in what we required."
11/27/17,5,Great service !!!! Friendly and helpful staff !
11/27/17,5,Would recommend. Good quality work and ready when they said it would be.
11/27/17,5,"All staff at hunters Land Rover very polite and helpful, I traded my car in over the phone with nick jones for discovery sport, as I live 220 miles away from garage, nick is very pleasant and knowledgeable, and I have no hesitation coming back to this garage, highly recommended here if you're looking for any Land Rover model,
Collecting new car 10/ out of 10
Excellent hand over , pleasure , prices very competitive also,"
11/27/17,5,Over the past 25 years I've purchased many vehicles from a number of manufacturers and dealers - I can honestly say the level of service I received from everyone at Cooper BMW was second to none.
11/27/17,5,"Simon provided excellent customer care, and I received my car back as new following its service and a couple of additional jobs."
11/27/17,5,"Excellent service , good price"
11/27/17,5,Wonderful experience. Very professional... Service was excellent. I would recommend Mercedez-Benz of Derby to anyone!
11/27/17,4,We wished to exchange our Freelander Metropolis for a Discovery Sport and found the whole process was very straightforward.
11/27/17,5,"I would definitely recommend Mini Cooper in Colchester, they are so friendly and always offer excellent customer service. I had my Mini serviced the other day and I must admit they always understand exactly what the customer needs, especially Chris & Amy ! Thank you once again for a very pleasant experience :-)"
11/27/17,1,"Despite booking the car in weeks in advance, no courtesy car available. Arranged collection of car from work, when I mentioned when the car was available for collection.
Contacted by text the day before the service, to arrange pick up of the car. I phoned back immediately, apparently the reception staff had gone home and sales team refused to take a message about the car only being available after the school run. Arranged to have the car delivered back to work by 5.30 pm at the very latest to allow school pick up, the car arrived about 5.50, left children waiting by the kerbside on a dark night in November as school had closed. The vehicle inspection performed when the brake pads were replaced must have been cursory, they failed to notice the worn tyres booked in to be replaced next week. I don't mind them not looking over the car - but they shouldn't provide a leaflet to say its done if they haven't done it.
Over £200 for 2 sets of brake pads, wonder what it would have cost if good service was included?"
11/27/17,5,"My sincerest thanks to the team at Cooper Croydon and in particular, Grant Jones who exceeded my expectations and looked after me over the 10 day period from first enquiry to me collecting the car. Grant kept me informed of progress from servicing and preparation to presentation and completion.
Grant is a real asset to Coopers. Thanks once again."
11/27/17,5,"Had no problems the sales rep was very professional, he explained all my options in detail"
11/27/17,5,"Great service from MB Oxford. And what is the most important for me, no artificial faults detected. I especially like a short movie that I received after the service. The movie was shot using mobile by a mechanic who worked on my car. All the faults he found were documented there and I could see underneath of my car what he was talking about. Thank you!!!"
11/27/17,2,"Pre booking OK - but their system was down when I first called (""please call back tomorrow""). On day, car parking (Cobham branch) chaotic - triple parking, drive just wide enough to get through (I had series one!), no parking, so had to reverse back out. No wonder we were texted to tell us to get their 10 minutes early - needed to simply park car. Then they had trouble finding my winter tyres - I was asked to go home and they contacted me later to confirm they had ""found them"" Sure they're not mine, but hey; ho. They sent a video of ""a visual inspection next day"". But it was wrong registration number. Nice clean of car. Trying to look professional - failed miserably."
11/27/17,4,No hot biscuits or soft drinks??
11/27/17,5,"Great service - ready ontime, cleaned and a fresh MOT...."
11/27/17,5,"all round excellent service, as always."
11/27/17,5,"This is now the third new Audi car that we have purchased from East Kent Audi. The latest experience was a good one with the salesman (Nick Wilson) showing himself to be extremely helpful, patient, and keen to provide what we wanted. The Manager, David Bowler, was very helpful when we needed to have an issue resolved which he managed to our satisfaction. All in all an excellent experience, and backed by very good support from the spares and workshop staff.

Thank you."
11/27/17,1,West London VW have the worst customer service! Avoid like the plague!!!!
11/27/17,5,"The whole Toyota experience was a joy, from collecting my car for it's service, to returning to my drive washed and cleaned.
A special thanks to Charlie for the follow up call, she was ""great"""
11/27/17,5,Quality service as you would expect from a premium brand
11/27/17,5,From a customers perspective it was very easy and quick to book an appointment. I like the reminders via text etc. I do also like the personalised video which has an overview of the service and tells me exactly what is ok and what needs to be changed.
11/27/17,2,"Quoted incorrect price on parts and installation of tracker, not told until they came to do the work which was hours after I'd dropped my car off.

Mercedes wouldn't honour the price, despite me confirming and reconfirming the price with them several times on the phone previously. It was around £200 more expensive, and the susbscription was for 5 years and not a lifetime as they'd told me.

Given I was also getting £750 worth of other work done (locks change after my car was stolen), it would have been nice if they'd given it a quick clean after all the hassle caused (considering this is what they do when you get your car serviced), but they didn't.

It's a real shame. I pay a premium for a premium service and, despite everyone being nice and polite, I rarely get it at Mercedes."
11/27/17,5,"I dealt with Matthew at Cooper Banstead Mini,
he was very helpful and found the right car for us within a day.

The service throughout the whole experience was exceptional.

Thank you Cooper Banstead, and a big thank you to Matthew."
11/27/17,5,"Service from start to finish was exceptional, as you would expect for the brand, especially as was a recall and not a money generating job. Courtesy car given, car cleaned and an inspection done to advise any works done. Laura did everything she could to make the experience seem straight forward and kept me up to date at all times"
11/27/17,2,"It took me 3 weeks to book a service in, which included emailing them directly, contacting Mercedes via social media and being contacted by their HQ on numerous occasions who tried to get me in contact with the Oxford branch.

It seems that although same brand, none of the branches are connected or know of my history (I have been to the Slough branch a few years back and expected the Oxford branch to at least be aware).

Once in the dealership, the service was great but apart from that, the overall customer service I received from Mercedes was extremely poor considering this is suppose to be the more exclusive brand who you'd expect to offer you a flawless experience.

In order to be better, Inchape should push Mercedes to invest more in their customer service from tech and strategy perspective. Also, they should try to answer their customers inquiries.

Addition - Mercedes responded to this comment asking to contact them after I clearly stated how difficult it is to get through to them. They haven't provided me with a name to reach out to or a direct number/email to contact. How am I suppose to reach out to you Mercedes? Even yesterday after 3pm I wasn't able to get through as my car is in for some repairs but no one picked up my message requesting a call back (yes I did leave my reg plate and my phone number) and now my car is in for another unnecessary day. Mercedes - here is my advice: get your staff to respond to clients and answer their calls. If you are just going to ignore your clients, remove the automated answering service all together along with the option to email you online. Also, your online quoting option doesn't work."
11/27/17,5,My visit was a great success. Not only was my problem dealt with promptly but in addition the car was given a free health check and a clean. All members of staff that I dealt with were polite and efficient.
11/27/17,5,"Service A to a Mercedes R350: the service took longer than expected (2hrs against 1hr foreseen), but it was impeccable and with very good value for money. The waiting lounge is extremely comfortable, and my car was thoroughly cleaned, which certainly made up for the extra waiting time."
11/27/17,4,"Service reception was quick, efficient and helpful. Good explanations of what was involved and likely costs. The report from the service was clear and easy to read and included a video which was very useful because there was some damage to the underside of the car. The only reservation I have concerns the initial contact when I had to explain what I needed three times and the Booking In agent was very slow and uncertain. Otherwise excellent."
11/27/17,5,"Lovely people, very kind and thoughtful, always remember my name and the personal details.

My new Discovery if all I hoped for and more, no fuss, all the paperwork taken care of, very smooth transaction.

Excellent job!"
11/27/17,5,Swift pleasant friendly service. A great experience Kept informed at all stages.
11/27/17,5,Extremely professional. MOT completed quickly and car valeted. Also the video healthcheck was a nice touch.
11/27/17,4,My Car service was done professionally and the car was cleaned inside out before they delivered it back. The service summary exceeded my expectations so I really recommend them. The only reason I gave the m 4/5 points is that their separate body shop garage forgot to include a quote for a minor body repair I wish to get done. Their Lexus customer service is fantastic.
11/27/17,5,Excellent service from beginning to end.
11/27/17,5,No problems at all with the service. Dropped the car and had a courtesy car ready to drive away.
11/27/17,5,"Great service.

I needed the break pads done and they did it on the day.

Also they didn't try to sell me anything like it happens in another places. Super comfortable and nice people

Worth the money!"
11/27/17,5,"5* rating. Dropped my Audi Q3 off at 2:30pm for an MOT & emissions test and the car was ready to be collected at 4:30pm having sailed through the MOT and been valeted at no extra cost. They even gave me an Audi cleaning kit for free, one happy customer here, would happily recommend their services!"
11/27/17,5,"Excellent service, polite and very professional. Many thanks to Paul on the service team for his great service."
11/27/17,2,"Usually excellent experience but this time at Swindon was poor. checked car in at 08.30 and confirmed extra items above standard service. Heard nothing and received no audi-cam update and around 14.30 I called them, to be told that there was no information on when my car would be ready, then received a return call to say ready for 17.00. At 16.50 they called to say my car wasn't ready (but I was already nearly there), and that it may be ready Saturday or Monday. Finally collected on Saturday, and was told various items were in need of work but they had previously been done, and the customer services person argued their case until their own records showed them to be wrong. All in all something went wrong for Swindon Audi on Friday 24th November and it was a bit of a disaster. Hope they can get back to their previous great service otherwise I will be looking elsewhere."
11/27/17,1,"Very disappointed
Brought my VW Tiguan 2.0 TDi automatic for a diagnosis on a problem with the drive train. Told the service dept there was a noise coming from the centre line of the car sounding like a bearing. The noise was when slowing down from 30 mph to 0mph. It made this noise in all gears but ceased when in neutral. I had formed this opinion while driving it myself but wanted a professional to pin point the location for me. I returned to the dealer having left work early to pick up the car to be given a written report that basically repeated everything I had said myself I was charged £96 for information that could have benn gathered driving the car around the car park. I was then told a further 2 hours of investigation was required at £96 per hour to investigate further. While I understand a company has to charge for work done I would have thought to charge someone £96 for basically nothing is a little excessive. I would have thought a phone call to say it was not possible within the time scale would have been more appropriate. If anybody asks me about my dealings with VW dealers it won’t be a positive one."
11/27/17,5,"My husband and I looked to buy two new cars after calling in to consider BMW as an option. From start to finish the process was easy and enjoyable for us throughout and focused on our availability to deal with issues and our convenience. Our sales executive - Nick Jimson - offered a professional and courteous service at all stages, maintaining a personal contact and assisting when needed. All staff were friendly and helpful and we would certainly recommend the dealership if asked to do so."
11/27/17,5,"Excellent service, helpful , enthusiastic car people, car was cleaned to a high standard post service."
11/27/17,4,"Customer service and reception was great.
Only issue is still the customer parking which is extremely difficult."
11/27/17,5,"Excellent service exceptional care taken whilst in there Dealership,Would highly recommend and I look forward to my next visit.👍🏻"
11/27/17,5,Very smooth running operation. Thanks
11/27/17,3,"Good quality vehicles and knowledgeable sales staff. Let down by inflexible pricing policy had to pay the £113 on a £31,113 car, would have walked away except for partners enthusiasm."
11/27/17,5,"They carried out the regular 15,500 mile service (having topped up the AdBlue the week before as the notification came up after I had scheduled my service but would not last until the car went in).
There were also a couple of issues with the car. A bug in the audio system software which an update was installed to fix and the SatNav software needed updating. Both of which were completed.
The car was returned promptly with all work completed and cleaned as well.
Many thanks, great service."
11/27/17,4,"Very helpful pick up and drop off. Detailed account of car health via video link useful
Courteous and good service all round"
11/27/17,5,"Fantastic service , more then I expected !"
11/27/17,2,"Made a 10 oclock appointment for brake pad change, on 2hr wait on site appointment. Work started 2hrs hours later (1215). After a vehicle check, stated that I needed brake and disc changes on front which were changed 20k previously, but looked ok to me - questioned this work and left side whilst work was been carried.
Had no call back saying the work was completed, luckily it was when i arrived back at 4pm. - on inspection of the works pads looked the same depth to me. Rear pads and disc changed no problem.
Still waiting call back from sales advisor on new car purchase - going elsewhere."
11/27/17,4,"We have recently bought a new car rom Mercedes Benz Liverpool. We are thrilled with our new car - the first time we have bought a Mercedes. The service provided by Jenn Lawler was excellent, she was friendly, helpful and professional and she delivered excellent customer service. The only reeason I have not rated the dealership as 5 stars was due to the fact that we waited around for over 15 minutes on Saturday 11th November for someone to approach us to ask us did we need any help - it was obvious we needed help and we just seemed to be ignored. Whilst I agree we should have time to look around in a non pressurised environment I also think the overall level of service on walking into the dealership could be improved. Once we were greeted the service and approach were very good and have been since we ordered the car. I would recommend Liverpool Mercedes to others, the staff and showroom were overall of a high standard. Jus make sure potential buyers are swiftly greeted on arrival!"
11/27/17,5,"Very easy and well managed process from initial phone call to dealership all the way to driving off in the new vehicle. Daryl was our only point of contact which makes for a very personal experience, and was always quick to respond to our queries. He took the time all the way through the process to ensure we were very clear on each step and nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommended - great product and excellent service."
11/27/17,4,Refreshingly honest feedback given with regards work that needed doing on my vehicle. Easy to book. Would recommend.
11/27/17,5,"Booked 20000 mile service on Prius with courtesy car.
Fast & efficient with no problems.
Very courteous staff"
11/27/17,1,"Car very poorly prepared and has to go straight back in for bonnet respray.
Not what I would have expected from Audi as their processes must have failed three times to let it out.

1.5 working days later and still no word on when it can be done"
11/27/17,2,"The vehicle needed three tyres and a brake inspection. Only one tyre was available so two still need to be replaced, Kwik Fit could have done all 3 at the same time, I'll know next time. When I collected the car the tyre pressure warning light came on, all 4 tyres had a different pressure in them so back to the garage I went, doesn't fill you with confidence does it. Attention to detail is poor and this is not the first time I've had a disappointing experience here."
11/27/17,3,"Not the greatest, they didn't even know that I was booked in. Also had my tracking and alignment done three days prior only to jump back in the car to find that the wobble was back(and it was definitely fixed). I can only assume that my car was curbed, watched an employee drive up and over the curb a few days before because he wouldn't wait for a light. It was a black 17 plate polo, I'd be pretty annoyed if that was my car, so one would assume...."
11/27/17,5,"Bought my car from Mini Thames Ditton and this was the first MOT and vehicle check. Staff very helpful, couldn’t do enough. Car even delivered back to me!"
11/27/17,5,Efficient and courteous
11/27/17,1,"Purchased a used Nissan from VW Telford - I should have ran a mile when I heard the sales manager impolitely discuss another client whilst he was out at his car but they had the car we wanted on the forecourt, and our sales advisor was actually good, so we went ahead. After handing over the money and driving away, that is where the customer service ended! Parking sensors weren't working on the vehicle we soon discovered, but even though we had a 3 month warranty with VW they just reverted us back to Nissan as still had a couple months left on manufacturer warranty (thanks for the useless added extra VW). Whilst checking out sensor problem Nissan did a health check and recommend our brake pads were replaced- the is 4 weeks after purchase from VW! So I contacted VW, but they didn't want to know. Spent over 2 hours in their service department when I was told it would be a 50 min job - just for the rude sales manager to say they are over legal limit so not our problem basically- yes they're legal but not what you expect when you've just purchased a car 4 weeks ago! Avoid this showroom the guys are cowboys."
11/26/17,5,"We decided to look for our new car at Audi Macclesfield because we knew it was a brand we could trust and had heard good reviews of their service through friends. Throughout our Audi experience we have not been disappointed, their prices are competitive and their customer service goes above and beyond.On entering the dealership your greeted quickly by a member of their team who are happy to help and make you feel valued as a possible customer,in a lot of dealerships I have visited I have often felt as though if they do not expect a sale with you on that day their advisors do not take the time with you,this wasn't the case at Audi Macclesfield. Our advisor was Adrian Ball who I couldn't recommend enough,he was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and most importantly he didn't pressure us into a sale which I was worried about as I've felt pressured previously at other dealerships.From start to finish Adrian went above and beyond,even staying late on handover day to ensure we were comfortable and happy with our new car aswell as going for a quick drive with my husband and I so that we felt comfortable driving it home, at one point I told Adrian to finish up so he could go home but he said that customer service always comes first which frankly I found a breath of fresh air. Adrian was also very clear that the service doesn't stop at handover day and should we need anything at all we can call him which I think is fantastic customer service.So thank you so much to Adrian for all your help and advice,we are extremely pleased with our new car and look forward to seeing you again in the future."
11/26/17,5,"I had a great experience buying a car at Cooper BMW York. Everyone from the receptionists to my sales executive Garry, gave superb customer service."
11/26/17,5,"The experience I had at Audi Crawley was fantastic because they had exactly the car I wanted at a very reasonable price and were extremely helpful in agreeing a sensible settlement deal with my existing part-exchange cars. DAN is most definatly the man - a great sales man with exceptional negotiating skills as I think im quite hard to deal with. Phil the business manager who I also met is a very reasonable man who finalised the deal and Jason the used car saled manager who I have known for some years, he is my favourite as I have bought cars from him in the past and never let me down... Lovely people and a great team. Thank you also to the kind receptionist who game me drinking chocolate and biscuits. Lovely place to do business. Think ill stay with this lot for some years to come. If they can put up me!! Thank you!"
11/26/17,5,"Booked a service and MOT..The site is clean, bright and airy with comfy seats and complementary mags etc. Service advisor Mike was polite, knowledgeable and professional. Mike kept me informed of progress... Got a cup of coffee and a courtesy car... Car ready when agreed... Car had also been cleaned and polished to a high standard. This was first class service from Inchcape Manchester. Thankyou!"
11/26/17,5,Car collected as promised polite and friendly communication.Excelllent
11/26/17,5,Very impressed with service
11/26/17,5,Excellent in every way
11/26/17,5,"Vehicle was collected and dropped back in time mentioned.
Was washed and cleaned inside and out.
The dealership and especially Adam have never let me down.
Despite living in Leicester all our cars go to Loughborough.

I highly recommend the team at Loughborough Mercedes."
11/25/17,1,"Ordering a new car is exciting! We can choose the colour and spec exactly as we like it and there it arrives in all it’s glory! Amazing experience! - Until you find that “your new Audi” is not exactly what you ordered! You’d hope that this kind of thing doesn’t happen (or at least that it doesn’t happen to you)! But there you are standing next to your shiny new car and something is missing… You’d think that a reputable Audi dealer would find the right way to deal with something like missing an option from the car specification. Well, think again! I got my car over a month ago and there is still no resolution! I was assured that I’d get a call back from a manager which didn’t happen. It seems that one gets the expected level of Audi customer service only before you hand over the money, but if your car is not as ordered there is nobody who’s willing to put things right! I would definitely not recommend Crawley Audi to any of my friends, or enemies for that matter! When you are paying 40k for a car you just expect to get what you ordered!
By the way, I am still waiting for the promised call back for the management team at the Inchcape Audi! I guess you were right on your website when you said – “Why Choose Inchape? – Discover the Inchcape Difference”… you just forgot to note that “the difference” is your appalling customer service, which one wouldn’t expect from a reputable Audi dealer!"
11/25/17,5,"My car was booked in for a recall. The staff were very friendly and helped me out because I was time limited having to be back at Worthing by 3-45pm. Unfortunately I was held up by road works and was half an hour late for my appointment, but the repairs were very quickly underway. Excellent service and hospitality from all concerned."
11/25/17,5,"I purchased a car from Cooper BMW in Boldon this week, the service and attention to detail was second to none."
11/25/17,5,"Graham Hall and the team at Cooper BMW Tunbridge Wells were excellent from start to finish. Efficient, knowledgeable, friendly, polite and taking time to explain everything. Definitely not true of many other dealerships I visited to buy my new car."
11/25/17,5,"Had the best customer service ever, Lee Machin at Audi Macclesfield is an absolute star. Found us the perfect vehicle and advised us extremely well throughout the buying process. We are not the easiest of customers at times (there's so much to choose from) but Lee was always able to explain and he ensured we were happy with our purchase. I would certainly recommended Audi Macclesfield and especially Lee. Thank you"
11/25/17,5,Very pleased with the whole process from sales to delivery. Helpful and professional personnel who offered to spend time to help me familiarise with the functions of the car even after delivery.
11/25/17,5,"Just bought a Jaguar XE R Sport from the above dealer and I have nothing but praise to the team down there for the courteous and professional matter they do their business in. In particular, I would like to mension Mark Allen (Sales) and Luke Frost for their attention to details and ensuring the deal was completed as promised.
Let’s just say, if you intend to purchase a Jaguar I would recommend H.A.Fox to treat you special - thanks again."
11/25/17,3,"Had an MOT booked for 10.15 and was informed that the process would take 60 minutes. However, I had to ask after 2.5 hours where my car was. Your staff seemed surprised I was still waiting; I then had to wait a further 30 minutes.

The MOT was completed and the car was cleaned, both to a high standard.

Please be honest with the time required"
11/25/17,5,"Cooper BMW to the rescue - managed to write off both nearside tyres on our X3 only minutes into a 260 mile trip. The breakdown truck got us to our home dealer, Cooper BMW, who slotted the car into their schedule straightaway. All done with willingness to help - and the coffee was good too."
11/25/17,5,"I would recommend Cheshire Oaks Audi to anyone. I received great service from the Audi team, in particular Malcom Edwards. Malcom took the time to understand the specifications I required in my A7.

What impressed me the most was due to my time lines Malcom took the time to come into the Cheshire Oaks showroom on his day off to discuss the vehicle he had found, which included a very impressive saving on the car. The rest is history I am now the proud owner of a A7 Sportsback which I collected on Friday 24th November.

Regards Graham Buchan Aberdeen Scotland."
11/25/17,5,"Fantastic customer service , friendly staff and great environment ."
11/25/17,5,Very good service
11/24/17,5,"Incredible customer service and experience, would recommend to anyone. To add to this a special thank you to Grant in BMW Sunderland for all his help in the transition to my new vehicle."
11/24/17,5,Car picked up ok. Told when car arrived for service. Health check video ok. Car dropped back nice and clean.
11/24/17,5,"Servicing handled efficiently from booking through to collection.

Will need to return to arrange for software update."
11/24/17,5,Took vehicle for a service and the standard of customer care was exceptional. The service supervisor allocated to me was very informative and kept me updated on progress throughout the service.
11/24/17,4,"Excellent Service, but pricey.
They go though the standard check-list for a service without paying attention to the actual condition of the parts on the vehicle. Example: I had changed the car's key battery 2 weeks before the service (at a cost of GBP2.50) and they changed it again during Service, at a cost of GBP8.33+VAT)."
11/24/17,5,Excellent well organised support. Impressive!!
11/24/17,5,"Helpful friendly staff...the last two visits the first one fixed my fault for free and the second issue was done very cheaply and therefore honestly!

Good coffee too!"
11/24/17,3,"The Service department staff are helpful, well informed and efficient.

The front desk receptionist is inattentive and rude. Interestingly I was not alone in this experience, the lady in the queue behind me fully endorsed my opinion.

A great shame as the front desk is the initial impression of MB, the service staff were charming even when clearly busy."
11/24/17,5,"Polite, considerate & calm service. No hassle but willing to go the extra mile to assist with achieving a good result.

The handover was pure theatre & very impressive.

My salesman was Paul Care & I would recommend him to any purchaser"
11/24/17,5,"Customer service was excellent. They price matched a competitor for the MOT and were courteous and professional throughout. I liked the video they emailed which showed them inspecting the car. It's the first time I have used Inchcape, Burton and I will choose them again rather than the Toyota garage I have used in another town. Overall a good experience."
11/24/17,5,I required some screen wash and was pleasently suprised by the competitive price and also was unclear on what engine oil was required for my car. The representative was curteous and clarified everything clearly for me. I was not kept waiting either. Customer service at this dealer is excellent.
11/24/17,5,Excellent service. Courtesy car was clean and tidy.
11/24/17,4,after a previously poor service experience in Feb 2017. I gave them another chance and had great service. James in the service dept was particular helpful
11/24/17,5,"welcomed, offered coffee, friendly conversation, service explained and carried out quicker then expected. excellent all round."
11/24/17,5,"Excellent service from pickup of courtesy car to return and collection of my car. All work completed, on time and car cleaned throughout. Professional and efficient."
11/24/17,5,Very convenient to have the car collected and returned with everything done - it saves me a day. The car is always faultless so I take that to mean that the services are being carried out correctly. No hesitation in recommending Inchcape UK from my experience.
11/24/17,5,Friendly professional staff. The car was ready when they said it would be. I was taken through the service and shown a video afterwards. I would recommend to others.
11/24/17,5,Very helpful at all times.
11/24/17,5,"The Best ever! Everyone we encountered from booking a Service etc., to when we picked up our vehicle was so professional yet engaging. We were particularly impressed by the staff on the desk when we took our vehicle in to Chelmsford (including the mechanic waiting to take our vehicle) were very helpful and personal. this is exactly why we have been customers at Mini Chelmsford for 10yrs!!!!"
11/24/17,5,I’ve been a Bmw customer for yrs and I would go anywhere else. Sales and service are second to none. Nothing as ever been a problem.
11/24/17,5,"Great service, good communication"
11/24/17,1,"I bought 5 JLR cars, my latest was an F Type exactly a year ago. Not had good service each time its had to go back. Just tried to place abn order for a New Velar. Salesman offered nearly £20k less than I paid a year ago !

Mentioned that we have 2 x Evokes 1 x Vogue that's up for change a F Tyoe and an F Pace. Asked the question about JLR and the Salesman told us its not relevant 😳😳 . WOW.

I've had many previous JLR cars. I get more for my car from an independent on a p/x. For what is an immaculate well looked after car. Hunter Chester have been scored low to quality of service. And the disgraceful wat the salesman didn't recognise 3 cars previously purchased from the compan and informed us that loyalty doesn't fall into the criteria.

Ricard Boreham MD of V4B recommended I make my JLR purchases here.... Not no more

11/24/17,5,"Cheerfully greeted by Faith, my Service Advisor, when I walked through the door. My car was immediately taken to the workshop for work to begin. I was escorted to the owners waiting area where I was given the hot drink of my choice complete with biscuits! Connected to the Wi-Fi and finished some business I was working on. Received a video outlining the results of my vehicle's heath check, and soon Faith walked to the waiting area to discuss the outcome in more detail. My car was cleaned inside and out. I couldn't be happier with the service I received at Cooper BMW, Norwich."
11/24/17,5,Did what they said they would.
11/24/17,5,Katie Briton-Powell my Sales Consultant was exceptional. She explained everything impeccably to me and got me a top deal
11/24/17,5,"Always a pleasure visiting Cooper Mini, Norwich! Always made welcome and everything simply explained. My Clubman looked absolutely stunning yesterday following its MOT after its ""wash and brush up""!

Many thanks to all"
11/24/17,5,"A very pleasant experience. Received a letter for a recall and simply contacted Inchcape, who handled the whole thing, efficiently and quickly."
11/24/17,5,Excellent service car collect and brought back washed and hoovered
11/24/17,5,Handled politely an effectively
11/24/17,5,Overall no problems and no worries a satisfactory visit.

Reception staff and customer service staff second to none. my favourite ever main dealer."
11/24/17,5,"Excellent service, polite and efficient"
11/24/17,5,Great service and extremely professional. Highly recommended.
11/24/17,2,Poor collection and return service
11/24/17,5,Excellent personal attention from Mercedes Benz Leicester new C Class Sport Estate purchased very satisfactory deal special mention for salesman Alex
11/24/17,5,Good service
11/24/17,5,my polo was collected from my home for its mot and a service and returned to me when this was completed it had also been valeted all work done to a very high standard
11/24/17,2,"Can never get it right - either come to collect the car on the wrong day or not at all, cancel appointments at the last minute, try to fix issues but don't diagnose the problem properly - the people are perfectly pleasant but I expect a lot better from Lexus Nottingham"
11/24/17,4,Almost perfect
11/23/17,5,My recent visit to Cooper BMW - Banstead exceeded my expectations. The reception was fantastic and overall service excellent
11/23/17,5,"My local BMW dealership and service
Centre Cooper Chelmsford, are always friendly and helpful, and will often take on queries with a smile and can do attitude.
My recent major service was carried out as requested, although they did overlook a battery issue they have offered to have the car back and sort it out. It is a shame they missed it but I can’t let it spoil my 5 * review 🙂"
11/23/17,5,Great customer care. Friendly helpful staff
11/23/17,5,"brilliant service, i highly recommend Inchcape Bolton"
11/23/17,5,Looked after very well. Comprehensive briefing about Land Rover vehicles we were interested in purchasing. Smooth from non-owner to owner.
11/23/17,5,"Friendly welcome, kept well informed, and accommodated appointments, drop off and collections to my needs.
Would have had a long delay if I'd needed a courtesy car but thankfully I was able to work around this."
11/23/17,5,Absolutely fantastic experience in buying our new car here. It was a seamless transaction from our old to car to new. The sales people were knowledgeable and helpful.
11/23/17,5,Brilliant experience as always from VW in Chelmsford - very helpful!
11/23/17,4,"It would be a glowing 5* review if not for the one niggle which was upon arriving at reception and informing them I was there to drop my car off for a service I was told to take a seat, so I did....... half an hour later and still expecting my name to be called I went up to another desk and asked the lady what was the delay as I'd been asked to have the car there no later than 10am and it was now 10:15 she apologised and said she had no idea why reception had told me to take a seat.
At least I know now for future reference to blank the fake smiles at reception and go straight to the servicing desk."
11/23/17,5,salesman most helpfully
11/23/17,4,Overall the experience was good. I was however surprised to be kept waiting half an hour before I was seen at an accredited BMW garage. When you pay close to 300 pounds for an interim service I would expect more prompt service than this. Staff did apologise but I ended up being slightly late for my appointment as a result.
11/23/17,5,Excellent service from Kellie Battman as always
11/23/17,5,"Excellent customer relations, would recommend the service to anyone."
11/23/17,5,"Have a 200,000 mile Touran. Runs like new after a service and when there is a problem the cause is quickly found and rectified correctly. The price is good and definitely worth every penny. They care. Been using this garage for 17 years now. Not had a single bad experience."
11/23/17,5,"The staff, the service and the mechanics are very good at what they do."
11/23/17,2,"I afraid to say our experience of buying our third audi. A3 from Maidstone audi was not one to right home about ,We had our original salesman who started our buying process leave Maidstone audi we were then given another salesman who completed our purchased.
We had to sign duplicate paperwork because of the salesman leaving ,we we're kept waiting for long periods when we had to visit Maidstone audi,Paperwork was brought to our home to be signed because of last minute deadlines ,On the evening we went to collect our new car we were at Maidstone audi for 1.5hours before we were presented with our new car in there presentation room.
The car was revealed and in the process of learning about various items a fault was Found on the car which for safety sake we could not drive away From the showroom ,The staff were very apoplectic and supplied us with a vehicle to get us home while our new car was booked into the vehicle workshop the following morning .
Our car was repaired and subsequently delivered to our home address by tom who managed himself impeccably throughout the whole process .
Audi now supply there customers with a full process the tract there car from original order to final delivery to the customer ,along the way every salesman we saw asked us if we were excited and looking forward to receiving our car ,we were originally but we thought things were going a bit pear shaped this was true as it worked out .
So we as customers were very disappointed with the process and the outcome at the end of the day ,we were given a full tank of petrol for the inconvenience we incurred instead of the standard half a tank .
I will be sending a email to Maidstone audi to complain about our dissatisfaction with there service"
11/23/17,5,Totally painless experience. Aaron was knowledgable and a credit to you.
11/23/17,4,"Pre booked Warranty Job carried out while I waited. Car washed and cleaned inside on return.
Efficient reception facilities.
EJP"
11/23/17,5,Excellent Service received whilst at Audi garage.
11/23/17,5,Very friendly and helpful staff. Many thanks to Rebecca Wright for guiding me through my first car buying experience and making the whole process so quick and easy. Love my new Audi A1 x
11/23/17,5,Listened to what I said and did what I expected of them. Gave informed advice as to items that needed attention and some that could wait until later. Always pleasant and helpful.
11/23/17,5,"Booking process was very efficient, although busy the service was completed well within the advised time for collection. The service advisor was very helpful and explained the actions required to address a couple of minor maintenance items, their urgency and therefore when the repair should be carried out. The work can now be scheduled for when needed, rather than pressing for immediate action"
11/23/17,5,"Excellent service from start to finish in purchase of a new car. Everything was spot on - just what you would expect from a high class, customer orientated company. Nothing was too much bother."
11/23/17,5,"I am ex motor trade and know how things should be done... Cooper BMW Durham certainly go the extra mile. I was greeted at the door and asked if they could help.. they checked which service receptionist I was booked in to see and shown to her desk and asked if I wanted a coffee. The car was booked in and we waited until the job was completed (fitting winter wheels an tyres). The receptionist came across and took me out to the car. I barely recognised it as it was so clean.
The greeting and service was first class.... the complete opposite to a Peugeot garage we were in the day before with my wife’s car... when we eventually found someone to talk to it was obvious we were a nuisance to the salesman... who was so disinterested it was embarrassing. It was the complete opposite at Coopers Durham."
11/23/17,5,The service I received was very professional and efficient. Car nicely cleaned as always. No issues.
11/23/17,5,After one or two hiccups last experience excellent
11/23/17,5,Would be good if the call centre that books with the garage could actually let the garage know they have committed them to a 1 hour service
11/23/17,5,Wonderful customer care and attention to detail throughout my vehicle's service. Will certainly use HA Fox again.
11/23/17,3,You book a tyre change online and when you speak to a staff member they say you have only booked a health check. You explain that that is not what you wanted. You give them your tyre sizes and they inform you they would call back to confirm. No call received but an email to confirm booking. You arrive at the dealership to be told you have booked a belt check and no tyres. Also a note on the system that states they had spoken to me and confirmed a price for the tyres but this isn’t true. Although an appointment at 10.15 get a message at 11.31 to say a health check has identified two from tyres as worn. This is the reason I went in as I was aware the tyres were wearing. I didn’t request a health check and then had to wait for the tyres to be fitted leaving after 12.00. In future I can be served quicker at a tyre centre.
11/23/17,5,"Welcomed at reception; Sarah was avaialbe straight away and told me everything I needed to know. I was sent a video via email and text, which was good. My car was ready at the time I asked for and I was seen quickly again by Sarah."
11/23/17,5,"The service I have received at any time with Inchcape UK as been outstanding and all the staff are courteous, polite and go out of their way to help with whatever your query is.

I love the videos that are sent for your purchasing of your car and also the servicing.

An outstanding experience."
11/23/17,3,"My car recently had to have a repair due to a safety recall. The service I received when booking the appointment via telephone was excellent. However the service at Mercedes itself was pretty average to say the least. I was told over the phone that a wash and vac service would also be provided once the repair was completed... this didn't happen! No other upgrades were provided either as the safety recall letter has stated.
If you are not going to provide the service then please don't tell customers you will!"
11/23/17,5,"Great service. Only downside was the horrendous courtesy car, but it got me home and back. Would recommend."
11/23/17,4,"My experience at Inchcape Volkswagen was completely satisfactory. My courtesy car was available as arranged on my arrival in the morning, the work on my car was carried out in a timely manner and I was able to collect my car at the prearranged time in the afternoon. The member of staff in Service Reception was professional and friendly in her approach and ensured everything was to my satisfaction. I will certainly be back again next year."
11/23/17,5,Excellent service on my recent visit to repair fault on my BMW X6 M vehicle which had a problem with the DynamicDrive. Simon Evans was very friendly and exact on what was happening with my car. Its still ongoing but I feel I am in the right place to get the fault resolved. Wonderful showroom lay-out a credit to the name BMW.
11/23/17,5,Quick and useful customer service when I took my car in for a service.
11/23/17,5,Exceptional service from both Steve’s in service
11/23/17,5,"This the best garage ever, the most polite staff I’ve ever come across !!"
11/23/17,5,"Excellent service, welcome by staff.

Very informative feedback during service.

Very happy with the full experience."
11/23/17,5,"Bought an approved used E-Class. Was so impressed with the service from salesman Chris Belch, traded in my old E-Class on a scrappage deal and bought a new A-Class for my wife. Couldn't be happier."
11/23/17,5,Very helpfull friendly dealership just bought a jaguar xf from here an im so happy with my new car thank you jaguar
11/23/17,2,Arrived at 2:30 for a service got told would take an hour but didnt leave untill 5 very slow
11/23/17,5,Excellent Communication and very swift service. Would highly recommend.
11/23/17,2,"Cooper of York, staff and service as good as ever.!
But let down by the fact that I book my Countryman JCW in there on their service line two week ago after been transferred over by the Mini Cooper switch board. The car was in for a brake fluid change under the TLC. I was told the first available slot at 8.30 while I wait..! was the 22 Nov. having arrived was told the car was outside the 50K limit by 38 miles 24 of which was driving to York.
Neil the service manager tried talking to mini with no joy. and also informed me I could of booked earlier direct with him even though I was transferred to their booking service which told me the first slot was 22 Nov.
So all in, not a pleased with the situation even though Cooper's tried with Mini they declined even though the initial booking was at fault.!
All for 38 Miles.

Stephen"
11/23/17,5,Recently purchased a new Mini Cooper. Service was excellent - I’m confident I got the best deal possible. Olivia was very knowledgeable about the car and the best options for me. Would definitely recommend
11/23/17,5,"Super service, just as I expected. Cooper BMW never let me down."
11/23/17,4,"Always a pleasant experience to visit Hunters service guys, courteous and friendly but professional and helpful - particularly Colin who is always pleased to meet customers and discuss any issues. Recommend without hesitation."
11/23/17,5,"Great service once again from Tonbridge, very reliable as always"
11/23/17,5,Mileage figure on Vehicle Health Check report was incorrect as was the date of the next service. This was reported to JXG and noted before I left the site.
11/23/17,5,"Great experience dealing with Colchester BMW, me and my Husband were served by Chris - amazing customer service and very nice guy. We love our new car! I would recommend them 100%"
11/23/17,5,High class customer service and regular status updates. They make you feel that your vehicle is in safe hands. Always very pleased with the service.
11/23/17,5,"Darren was helpful in every way and I couldn't have asked for a better service!
I came in looking for a used car that I couldn't get and was unavailable to me for various reasons and I thought I would have to give up there and then. However, Darren found me a beautiful new car that I was able to drive away within the week!
I truly can't fault the service received, not just on the first day but throughout the whole week and even on his day off! He went above and beyond to meet my needs, answer my 101 questions and match me to my perfect Q2!

Thank you Darren!!"
11/23/17,5,I took my Mercedes-Benz in for a health check and also a service what can I say amazing service as usual and deafly will be booking my next service with them next year. One thing that I did love is that they take a live video that shows the mechanic going round your car so you know exactly what's going on. Plus they are happy to answer any questions you have after the service Has been done. again amazing customer service. Very happy
11/22/17,5,"Really good service & MOT yesterday. All the staff I spoke to were polite and knowledgeable. They all appeared happy and well presented.
Great to get a video of the health check inspection.
Overall 5 stars."
11/22/17,5,Great great service and Lovely car Delivered.Excellent communication.Would recommend using Hunters of guilford.
11/22/17,5,"Great service, staff knowledgeable and friendly"
11/22/17,5,"Great service, great customer service and helpful staff"
11/22/17,2,"After months of VW Romford telling me I needed new tyres agreed to let them fit new tyres when booking in for MOT that they quoted as £50 although easy to get for £25 elsewhere I assumed that anything found would be under warranty as still had a month to run on the 3 year. Also told them that Heating Fan was making a niose and vibrating.

They were not able to do the tyres as they did not have any even though I booked in advance, but even though they didn't do the tyres it still passed the MOT ! (Tyres could not be that bad then!).
As for the waranty investigation request for the failty fan was told that it was probably a bit of paper that they could see and were not able to retrieve unless I paid for an hours labour . . . . . . .

Must say this is the second time I have had a bad expereince here, last time they insulted my wife by giving it the ""your only a woman"" act. Although they seem to have sorted out the sales side of the team the servicing and warranty is pretty poor so beware if you are looking to buy from here."
11/22/17,5,"Very good service , great work and manner Christine Adkin ."
11/22/17,5,Amazing service as always!!! They certainly do always put the customer first!!
11/22/17,5,"My Winter service was completed in very good time while I waited and my car was returned to me having been given an excellent clean
Staff very friendly and efficient"
11/22/17,5,Excellent service impressed with video review. Valet superb given that l have a dog.
11/22/17,5,"Efficient
Kept me updated
Explained extra works that were required with accurate costings"
11/22/17,5,"I had an excellent experience bringing my car in for its MOT.
I was treated courteous by all the staff I spoke to.
Sarah, who booked my car in, was very profession and friendly and made the process very easy.
She did everything she said she would and the whole process was very easy."
11/22/17,5,Excellent service. Got the video sent to my mail box in the same day with my full service. Really appreciated!
11/22/17,5,"Walk into a spotlessly clean reception area, greeted by a lovely young lady, who showed me where to go, Very helpful!
The service department took my details and keys, and I was on my way in minutes,
When the car was fixed, I received a call to say it was ready, the car was waiting for me, cleaned and hoovered,
Very good experience"
11/22/17,5,Very good service with efficient and polite staff. I was given a courtesy car for the time mine was in and they valetted my car as well. I woud highly recommend them.
11/22/17,5,Staff was brilliant
11/22/17,5,The representative was very knowledgeable and couldn't have assisted me more. Everyone in the dealership was friendly and helpful. I would recommend Inchcape/Cooper BMW to anyone.
11/22/17,5,I took my (Toyota) car to Inchcape Toyota after another garage quoted me £500 to replace the heater motor. Toyota insisted on doing their own diagnosis - and found the problem was a leaf in the pollen filter! Total cost £74 (and that was for various other bits and pieces that they did - e.g. change a split windscreen wiper). AND they collected my car and then brought it back. I am extremely happy with their service and recommend them wholeheartedly. Thank you Josh and Malcolm!
11/22/17,5,The staff are so accomodating and helpful nothing too much trouble. Friendly and proffesional Can't praise Aled enough.
11/22/17,5,Ecellent service - went the extra mile to sort out my problem
11/22/17,5,"Great experience everything very professionally managed from start to finish. This is now my Mercedes garage of choice.
Have had some horrendous experiences at Mercedes Stockport and they could learn a lot from this dealership!"
11/22/17,3,"No problem with the booking or my treatment on arrival and departure from the service.
Only disappointed that the car hadn't been washed and valeted. This hadn't been discussed but I had assumed that it would be done as a matter of course. The polythene seat cover, steering wheel cover and floor cover had all been left in the car as well.

Nothing major but I kind of expected an £80,000 car on a service plan to be cleaned and tidied.

thanks"
11/22/17,5,"The MoT (and health check) were carried out while I waited. The complimentary coffee and newspapers were welcome. The car was returned valeted and washed.
I was fully satisfied with the service I received."
11/22/17,5,"Appointment made at a time to fit in with my diary . Polite , helpful staff . Kept fully informed of ongoing work . Task completed within the promised timescale . Shown the video and the inspection sheets . Work done to the price quoted . Vehicle returned in gleaming condition and with a Winter care kit . Thank you Inchcape Bolton from a very happy customer ! Definitely five stars 🌟 🌟🌟🌟🌟"
11/22/17,1,"This is the second time I have used this branch. Arrived at appointed time, 9.30, again, the service desk was empty and had to wait 10+ minutes for someone to appear. Apologised and said had had to move cars. Did not seem aware that I had booked courtesy car, but said wasn’t a problem there was one ready. Then said charge was £15, I had not been told this when I booked it, if I had known I would have made alternative arrangements as I think this is outrageous. I have never had to pay for a courtesy car from other dealers. My car is automatic and I was given a manual, without being asked if my licence covered manual cars. I was asked what time I wanted the car back so I said 3.00 pm. Was phoned c1.00 pm to say car was ready. Arrived back at 3.00, no one at desk, waited 15minutes. Service manager spoke to us, explained £15 was for insurance, this was not necessary as own insurance would provide cover. Car was waiting to be washed and asked if we wanted to wait, said wanted car back as had other appointments. Service assistant apologetic and offered wash and vacuum next time we were passing. Will not be using Thames Ditton again. Marilyn Slann"
11/22/17,4,"I was reminded well before MOT and service was due to expire , online booking service was not great as most dates were showing already booked but when I phoned up it was avaialble. The booking process itself was straightforward and extra part I ordered on the booking date was in the garage on the day of MOT. Lucy was great on the day and although it took a bit of time but I was constantly given update, she was great!
The only downside was I wanted a quote which was lost in the whole process hence not five star.
MH"
11/22/17,5,"John and Claire were brilliant. My Polo GTI was serviced and cleaned to perfection. Everyone there including the salesmen were extremely friendly. Pricing was brilliant and I was kept informed throughout the day. They even let me borrow a brand new car for the day!

Would recommend this dealership to anyone I know. My girlfriend is now purchasing a Polo due to the outstanding level of service."
11/22/17,5,Easy to book. Welcoming helpful staff.car finished promptly
11/22/17,5,Just Perfect.....
11/22/17,1,Very rude staff
11/22/17,5,"prompt, well managed"
11/22/17,3,"My biggest annoyance is false advertising when purchasing the vehicle it was advertised with satnav, when it should of read satnav available ask salesman for details. So begrudgingly after having the vehicle for a week I found out satnav did not come with vehicle and at to pay £247 for the privilege so I can take my wife who cannot fly anymore due to a serious illness to travel Europe HENCE the need for satnav, It is not only the satnav other things came into the equation. It took me 4 years to try Mercedes again after the fiasco I had with my other Mercedes, But after this one I wont be going back Again."
11/22/17,5,"My Mercedes came up for service - they arranged to have the car collected and delivered back to my home, This happened exactly to the times specified, and a named representative phoned me as promised to update me with the progress. The car was serviced and valeted and returned to me as promised in great condition - perfect customer service."
11/22/17,5,"A good service. I had an MOT, free winter check and a brake fluid change and a free wash and valet of my Mini. It was very efficiently carried out. The following day we received a follow up personal email from the service manager."
11/22/17,5,Fantastic service from enquiry to completion of work.
11/22/17,5,Good service as usual. Courtesy car available and my car returned washed and hoovered throughout with report on various items
11/21/17,5,A super service. Very helpful and the car is fab. Thanks!!
11/21/17,5,"Hi
Great car buying experience
Excellent salesman"
11/21/17,5,"Couldn't book service on line, but no problem when I phoned MB Warrington to book. Whole service experience was hassle free and I enjoyed the hospitality provided while I waited for the return of my vehicle."
11/21/17,3,"1st smart forfour service
This was the first annual service. I had asked fellow smart forum members and the price I paid of £185 seemed about average. However another branch of Inchcape did the 1st service for another forum member for £135 (I have proof) which is why the middling rating. Other than that the service was completed promptly and my car was washed/vacuumed. A slight issue was a cup I had in the car disappeared after the service but when I went back to query it I was given a better one than the one that disappeared."
11/21/17,5,"Been very happy so far with Cooper BMW, good at communication, helpful, always fully investigate any concerns you may have with the car and return it washed and cleaned."
11/21/17,5,"Bury Branch. Servicing team, excellent with help and advice, nothing to much trouble. Courtesy car clean with 2017 plate. Staff very knowledgeable and friendly."
11/21/17,5,"Simon at Coopers Teesside arranged for a replacement car after booking mine in for instrument panel check as per BMW recall. I received an email shortly after returning home with a video health check update confirming there were no other problems to be looked at. The car was thoroughly checked, cleaned and returned to me by early afternoon. Have no problem recommending this dealership, I have nothing but praise for them ."
11/21/17,5,Very efficient service and helpful staff as ever.
11/21/17,5,"Good old fashioned personal service. Was informed all the time on the work that was needed and made to feel that I was an important customer.
Will go back again."
11/21/17,5,"As ever, a fantastic experience at Inchcape Audi. I recently went to collect my brand new car... the experience was top notch from start to finish. When making enquiries about new cars, Henry was extremely helpful without being pushy... he was very knowledgeable and sought to understand my specific requirements when discussing car options.
Both Henry and Jon looked at options to be as competitive as possible and were great throughout the whole ordering process.
When going in to sign finance paperwork, I did have to wait for a fair while, but had not got a prearranged appointment... this is the one thing that could be improved, but nothing major. I was offered a drink and members of staff kept me up to date
Collecting the car was easy and pain free. A real wow moment when seeing my car for the first time.... it was made really special. Everything was clearly explained to me so I felt confident driving away knowing how to operate the car and happy that I could contact Henry and the team if needed.
I would recommend inchcape Audi in a heartbeat.... a fantastic friendly service... I’ll be back for my next new car for sure!"
11/21/17,5,Absolutely nothing was a problem...Dan the salesman couldn't do enough for us...perfect service ...thank you...
11/21/17,1,"Unacceptable customer service by a sales manager Chris Greatorex..
Price quoted was revoked after they incorrectly imputed the wrong car supposedly even after it was checked 3 times..
He came out with the card machine in hand
Tried to disguise the catalogue of errors by adding an extra year to the agreement without informing us.
Absolutely blown away with the utter disregard and customer service."
11/21/17,5,"Polite, efficient service and my car returned on time and nice and clean"
11/21/17,3,"My car is under warranty however whenever it is brought in there is always an argument and finger pointing so that BMW are never to blame for the issue. My car was booked in for Thursday last week and it's now Tuesday evening and I still don't have it back. When you speak to someone on the phone (when you can get through that is) the details you give are never passed on, I honestly dread having to call or bring my car in as it's never a straight forward pleasant experience"
11/21/17,5,"Very good customer service level, one small issue which was resolved and compensated immediately."
11/21/17,4,"Friendly, courteous and efficient service. The car was picked up and dropped off at the times requested and the work carried out (3rd annual service and air con service) seems well done. The car was returned almost like new, having been washed and vacd. My only criticism was the invoice was a little on the pricey side, but I had been told the price in advance. Everything went like clockwork."
11/21/17,5,Every done as expected - usual high standards - thank you
11/21/17,4,"Week before I booked in, was told it would only take 2 hours for my service. Got there for the 8.15 booking finally got away at 11.30.
Car was valeted which wasn't the best I have to say.
Brake fluid hadn't been topped up not sure if that should have been or not.
Was sent a video of my car on the lift and explained everything underneath was all good.
Was kept informed of the progress"
11/21/17,4,"Great service by Tetbury Audi.

Welcome was good, refreshments offered. Speedily processed through the service manager, courtesy car handed over & our within 10 mins.

Pickup was just as swift, exactly what I want.

Thanks."
11/21/17,4,"Good service at garage, drop off quick and hire car of equal standard and clean. Use technology to keep in contact with update of vehicle and any repairs that need doing. Lost 1 star as trying to call garage and arrange to at least 3 attempts of being on hold then getting transferred to voicemail"
11/21/17,5,Excellent professional service as always! Even washed and valeted the car as part of the service and reasonably priced for main dealer service.
11/21/17,5,"Excellent After care service my Contact is Mark who is ever so good helpful and caring He has been looking after me ever since I have driven BMW,
Keep up the good work
Many thanks

11/21/17,4,"Excellent customer service, couldn’t ask for more"
11/21/17,5,"Courteous service , good information and statistics and a cracking good deal"
11/21/17,5,"Great service, from start to finish."
11/21/17,5,Great service from start to finish Ollie was particularly helpful in choosing options and the colour! Thanks for making the car change such a pleasure!!
11/21/17,5,"I was very satisfied with the service and customer care at my recent visit at Toyota, Derby Road, Nottingham."
11/21/17,5,Comfortable waiting area with space to work and free coffee. MOT carried out in the time stated.
11/21/17,4,Routine servicing is a painless experience with the vehicle being picked up in the morning and delivered back in the afternoon precisely as promised. We live 10 miles from the garage and appreciate this facility!
11/21/17,5,Car was properly MOT'd and serviced plus was ready at time promised . It was booked in and out professionally and efficiently. Video clearly explained state of vehicle. Little touches: e.g. topping up wind screen wash plus cleaning and vacuuming the vehicle enhance the service provided
11/21/17,5,"Excellent communication and very friendly staff from the moment I walked through the door. Reception staff front of house very accommodating and professional, Steve Billington very professional, courteous, and accommodating even down to providing a video of the health check carried out on my vehicle. I would highly recommend Mercedes of Liverpool if your looking for or in the market for a new or used car."
11/21/17,5,Very good efficient service. Like the pick-up/drop off service.
11/21/17,5,"always a pleasure to visit Lexus Derby , friendly staff and quality workmanship ."
11/21/17,2,"Car taken back to Warrington, for a recall issue. Requested copy/confirmation of work for lease. 3 days later, no email of works, as promised. Called dealership to be told that the evidence would not be provide as I did not turn up for the recall appointment. Really, so I sat in your dealership for 30 mins last week for the fun of it.
Eventually gained a call from the service manager, after being promised a call and requesting it three times, to be told the work did take place and email confirmation provided.
Customer service is dire, really putting me off purchasing Mercedes in the future"
11/21/17,5,"Brilliant!!!!

The most pleasing thing was Michael made us feel special, it seemed to us that it didn’t matter the value of the car, we were treated so well from start to collection.

Thank you for making our experience special"
11/21/17,5,"Very good service, I was well looked after and even got a complimentary valet. Would definitely recommend."
11/21/17,5,Very professional. Phil was helpful and polite and made sure everything was explained properly. I had an issue with the telephony in my car and he sorted it very efficiently.
11/21/17,5,Polite friendly staff and quick service.
11/21/17,5,All went to plan and car ready earlier than suggested.
11/21/17,5,"Great service, pleasant welcoming staff,
Great!"
11/21/17,5,Very efficient and extremely helpful
11/21/17,5,"Having bought cars from Cooper BMW Tunbridge Wells on several occasions, I can say they make the purchasing experience efficient and enjoyable."
11/21/17,5,Faultless. Pleasant experience.
11/21/17,2,"Booked my car online, to have worked done while wait, online says tea & coffee available, toilets etc.
Told to come back 3 hours later to get car, no toilets no waiting room, no tea & coffee, nobody asked if I needed to get somewhere for 3 hours.
My car had warnings about low battery, told it was ok but still low battery light comes on.
£300 for a minor service and complimentry health was quite exorbitant.
I won’t be going back."
11/21/17,5,"Excellent Service once again by VW Twickenham. particularly the Service Representative Dee, who kept me informed throughout the whole process. Car collected from home, new door lock fitted, car taken through the MoT, great Under Body Inspection Video producedand emaile, and car delivered back mid afternoon - fully valeted. I am happy to Highly Recommend!"
11/21/17,1,"After seeing a warning light come up advising me that i needed new brake pads and a service was due, i arranged a service, when i got the car back the warning light was still on and when i called to ask why, the man said they ran out of time as i had asked for the car to be ready by 4pm. He said he had simply forgotten to mention it or write it down anywhere! The fact that i was driving around oblivious to the fact that i had dangerously low pads did not seem to bother him. I expect more from what is supposed to be a quality marque."
11/21/17,5,Cannot fault Audi after sales service. Second to none.
11/21/17,5,"VW Twickenham never disappoint!
The service is second to none, courteous helpful staff from the moment you arrive through to collection of your car.
Everything is fully explained. The turnaround is prompt ( I dropped my car at 8am and it was serviced and cleaned by 11).
I have never felt that work has been carried out unnecessarily which gives me peace of mind.
No need to go anywhere else!"
11/21/17,5,"Brilliant service from start to finish. Very personal, friendly service throughout and couldn't be happier with my new car."
11/21/17,4,"As always, good service."
11/21/17,5,I bought my new mni from Cooper Tonbridge in the summer and had a great service from the sales team. Last week i had to take the car to the service team as the heated seat stopped working. It was a fast booking in service and the car was sorted and valeted within the same day. Very good aftersales service.
11/20/17,5,"I feel the car sales man is busy as responses were a bit slow. Apart from that excellent service, the guy who delivered the car spent time explaining and answering questions (Kevin).
I am delighted with my 2014 XF good price and immaculate condition.
Thanks DFA"
11/20/17,5,"The service I had at VW was really warm and friendly. John SMITH was welcoming and efficient. I got back a little early and staff were happy to make me a coffee while I waited for my car which had been cleaned after the MOT.
Highly recommended"
11/20/17,3,"The sale person was professional enough but was not budging on price on a decent 3 year old car but we had no part exchange and cash buyer, so there was room for movement. Fine he wasn't moving on price, he did rectify a number of body work minor defect before handover.

However, come to hand over, it was a car cover with rain. I emailed night before requesting car to be put under cover or dry it before handover but no such luck.

Had to ask for a couple of dry clothes to do it myself, just so I can see the minor repairs were done! To be honest, this was so basic and what I would expect from a decent dealership as standard practice that you shouldn't need to ask.

So the minor repairs were done well but I did not see there was a sizable chip, crack on the windscreen on the far left which driver would not see and certainly not when covered in water. Notice it only after I got home lunchtime when wife was driving, so I sat in front passenger seat then able to see the crack in front of me.

Called and emailed the dealer who now had my money and doesn't want to know about the windscreen, even though I make it clear it just needed filling at a cost of £30 or so rather than a new one. But sale person's manager said not in their remit to rectify crack on windscreen even though they did not see it, despite the vigorous checks they do prior to handover. AS per their advert and phone recording.

But they would and have refurbished the alloys at much higher cost and not something that would further deteriorate like the windscreen!

Personally, I think it was a big mistake of the dealer as I have now arranged my repair at £30 excess which ruined the whole purchase experience of what would otherwise have been pleasant! Now it just show that you DON'T EVER trust their vigorous checks and don't ever get a handover in the wet and insist they dry the car and NOT you. Because once they have your money, they're not interested.

The sale person Jack seems still willing to assist but not the management.
Jack is helping to forward the MOT which they forgot to enclose In the pack of paperwork.

So to sum up, good selection of cars at some reasonable prices but short on service level on vehicle preparation and non-interested management with some decent sale person but not the one at handover. Shame!"
11/20/17,5,"Very good service, and very helpful staff. Highly recommended"
11/20/17,5,Excellent service as usual
11/20/17,2,"We were not able to register the new car with the personalised number plate even though all of the information had been sent to them at the beginning of the week, we were kept waiting whilst new number plates were made up, there was no special treatment, flowers etc which other people seem to get. All in all not a good experience and we will not be recommending Hunters."
11/20/17,5,David Done was professional and courteous! He took the time to look for an Audi that would interest me and he found one ! Would definitely recommend him to anyone if they are wanting to buy an Audi. Very patient young man!
11/20/17,5,"Excellent customer service, James was extremely helpful and explained the controls of our new car in depth."
11/20/17,5,"Booked my Mini in for a free vehicle check after earlier in the week talking to Deborah and being informed of this service.
From arriving on the forecourt, I was met and taken over to the booking in desk. Offered a drink and shown the customer waiting area. The car was completed within their discussed time frame. I was taken back over to where my Mini was parked.
Later in the day I received a video clip showing the check. Thought this was a great touch. The value of the free check proved itself as a minor issue was raised and this is now booked in under the warranty for the work."
11/20/17,5,Fast efficient service
11/20/17,5,"Servicing was quick, thorough and expertly carried out. Staff were welcoming, pleasant and efficient. Overall excellent."
11/20/17,5,"Couldnt even try to mention a fault with service and professionalism ..I was kept up to date very often as I was waiting for my car service completion
and they explained to me in simple terms what may need doing in the future / status of vehicle today and likely costs . Brilliant all round service"
11/20/17,5,"It’s a very long story with finally a happy ending thanks to the whole Team at Hunters York, especially Colin Blenkinsop in Service and Steve Orton and Phil in sales. My faith in Land Rover has been restored!"
11/20/17,5,As I new customer to Mercedes I was a bit apprehensive on what to expect. The team were fantastic. I believe we spoke to Adam in service dept. Everybody was very efficient to say you were having a refurb. Look forward to next year. Many thanks!
11/20/17,3,The service was satisfactory and my problems were dealt with promptly but was very disappointed that my car wasn't valated it was left unwashed and given no reason why usually it's washed and polished after a service
11/20/17,5,"Lovely staff, outstandingly helpful AAA Service from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave."
11/20/17,5,"Service and 1st MOT for a Polo. Did everything as expected, no problems, also valeted the car which I wasn't expecting."

11/20/17,5,"Very friendly and very quick service while I waited, absolutely no complaints."
11/20/17,5,"I would recommend this company , I visited the sealand rd branch for an assessment on a particular issue with my VW scirocco lease car , I was welcomed @ the door by Naomi & offered a drink & seat immediately to talk through the necessary work required , I was also given a suitable courtesy car for my convenience to use until I picked the car up later on , it was washed & returned in a very clean condition inside & out with the issue fixed on warranty .
I am very impressed by the VW car I have leased from Inchcape Volkswagen & have had great follow up support & would definitely replace with a similar car with this company when the times comes ,
I Highly recommend this company"
11/20/17,5,"I showed up with a sick child in tow - they whisked me into a loaner as quickly as possible and got me on my way with smiles and courtesy. When I picked up the car, the experience was the same. Polite efficiency, and a clean, serviced car. They could not have made it any easier."
11/20/17,5,Great service fast work quality finish and a nice clean car at the end
11/20/17,4,"Have been using Cooper Cobham for some time now and their service is excellent. However, they dropped a star this time because the mileage was not reset correctly for the next service which means I had to take the car back to have it reset."
11/20/17,5,"My car was serviced last week, everything was so easy, from booking to collection . The team were very polite and even returned a nice clean vehicle !!!"
11/20/17,5,Excellent dealership with very knowledgable sales representative. Literally test drove and was in possession of a brand new M3 within a week. Would definitely recommend buying a BMW from Coopers York.

11/20/17,5,Polite and professional service. Easy booking process.
11/20/17,5,"Excellent customer service from all staff especially our service mechanic Ben, would highly recommend to all family and friends."
11/20/17,5,Very professional service/mot- always good results
11/20/17,3,"I cannot fault the work or the general support from service BUT I and my wife found the lady who spoke to us on the telephone, Amanda, curt, condescending and brusque to say the least. Not the impression any business wants to give to customers. Maybe she was having a bad few days!"
11/20/17,5,"Not as expensive as I thought it would be to go direct to dealership. Great service , honest up front advice. They do videos of the cars health check and send it to you which I think is great. I’ve had my car serviced, then recently had the cam belt changed and it’s due to go back in again for some repairs. They haven’t disappointed so far. I dealt with a guy called Steve for the service."
11/20/17,5,"Very happy with service provided by Inchape Southend, in particular Natasha who was helpful and very pleasant to deal with.

Thank you."
11/20/17,5,I cannot rate the team at Hunters high enough. Whilst they are not local to me I used them when my car developed a heater fault whilst travelling on a family day out.. Understanding that I had my family with me and the outside temperatures were very low the service team asked me to come and within 1 hour it was fixed. This is great customer service and I am very grateful to Colin and the team. My family day in York went well and not ruined. Thank you all..... that's called customer service and a great customer experience....
11/20/17,5,"Excellent team, great customer, highly recommended"
11/20/17,5,"While I've no experience of buying a car from the mini place at Tonbridge, when it came to having the car serviced, things could not have been better. Steve treats you like royalty and the car looked brand new."
11/20/17,5,Good service
11/20/17,5,Always very helpful and considerate with collect and return of car. Very satisfied.

11/19/17,5,"I was really very satisfied with the high level of service my wife and I received when we took our Golf into Exeter InchCape for its annual service.We thought the Service Advisor Aaron Gillson was excellent at explaining what was to be done to the car .I thought the under car video I was sent was really very good, not a view owners get to see very often. VERY WELL DONE to all staff at Exeter. T& D Wilkinson."
11/19/17,5,"Arranged for Avensis to go in for passenger airbag recall. Job was completed I two hours. In addition Toyota did a visual inspection of vehicle and checked tyres for wear. They also washed the vehicle,
The staff on duty were very helpful and the Workshop Supervisor talked to me in detail about my vehicle on completion of the work. I was very impressed with Inchcape Toyota at Derby and would certainly recommend them."
11/19/17,5,"I was doing VW Touareg 2014 major servise, I waited about 3 hours for car ,near vw you can find KFC and Subway. After 3 hours, the car was done and ready to go, nice cleaned and washed. The service manager was very polite and helpful."
11/19/17,5,Audi cheshire Oaks really accommodating to what we need David our salesman give us options explain well the deals etc. Excellent
11/19/17,5,"The guys were great and very helpful. They picked up the car, sent a video of the service and dropped the car back.There were no issues. I had taken a video of the car condition when it left and checked the car when it came back. Everything was good and they tool good for my car."
11/18/17,5,"We were able to look around without feeling under any scrutiny, but staff were on hand as soon as we were ready to discuss vehicles . Questions were answered and a test drive was offered and accepted on our first visit. Heath Downes was helpful and patient whilst we made decisions and completed the sale. Thank you."

11/18/17,5,"Excellent service, very professional and friendly staff. Very satisfied as always."
11/18/17,5,"Amazing service from Joao. He was extremely invested in making the experience as exciting as possible, whilst not rushing the sale. He has been in contact with me since Thursday to check that the car is driving well and to check that I am happy with it which has made me extremely impressed with BMW. I would definitely recommend BMW to anyone looking to buy a new or used approved car."
11/18/17,5,As always Mandie at Chelmsford made my experience fantastic.
11/18/17,5,Easy and professional service with a excellent salesman with quality cars
11/18/17,5,"Good service, thank you"
11/18/17,1,"One of the worst garage experiences I have experienced for many years. From over familiar call centre staff, through to an arrogant, rude and thoroughly unpleasant customer services agent I arrived, after 2 hours wait, to find my car completely unserviced. They had even ordered in the wrong part! A Twitter comment asked for my contact details so that they could respond. I gave the details but no one bothered to follow up my complaint.
Big thank you to Workshop Manager, Giles, who responded professionally and eventually got me back on the road. But my opinion of BMW and Cooper Norwich in particular has plummeted."
11/18/17,5,Very impressed with the quick response to my initial enquiry. Test drive arranged for the next day. Was looked after by Charlotte who was pleasant and enthusiastic and I bought the car. Picked it up a few days later it was immaculate and I’m very happy with it.
11/18/17,5,Many service visits always excellent service.
11/17/17,4,"I bought a used Audi A4 at the lower end of their price range but nevertheless received very attentive service. Pleasant people and very fair in their dealings.

The transaction seemed to involve an inordinate amount of paperwork but that is probably not their fault."
11/17/17,5,Excellent from reception to collection.
11/17/17,5,"Yes great first time I have had my E250 estate serviced since I purchased it earlier this year
They kept in contact throughout and kept the costs to the minimum.
Car washed but a bit dirty on wheels and no vacuuming of boot area. Apart from that fine"
11/17/17,5,Fantastic service from the moment I walked through in to the Dealership right until the moment I drove away with the vehicle.
11/17/17,5,Very good in all respect
11/17/17,3,The work and the individual handling it (Paul Lacey) was impeccable however trying to actually speak to the department was truly crap. Sort out the phone system as it rang out on internal transfer and never got answered
11/17/17,5,Very efficient service. The courtesy car was of a similar standard to my own. My car was dealt with very swiftly and valeted before collection.
11/17/17,5,"The customer service i received from Neil was amazing, he made me feel so comfortable and made sure I got the car the I wanted for a price that I could afford he was very helpful when he was dealing with me and even showed me everything on my new car and how it worked. He didn’t rush me and made sure I felt comfortable with my new car. I would highly recommend any friends or family to go to Neil and purchase a new car."
11/17/17,5,"I recently booked my BMW for a MOT at Coopers and was impressed with the service. The staff were friendly and helpful, there is a comfortable waiting area with refreshments provided. My car was checked over, tested and given a complementary wash."
11/17/17,5,I have a company car and have always been very well looked after by this dealership and the service staff are very helpful and friendly.
11/17/17,5,"Easy to book service & I choose the option to wait; car was ready pretty much in line with the time I had been given. All staff members were friendly courteous and knowledgeable.
Happy to recommend Coopers Cobham..."
11/17/17,5,Excellent service from start to finish. My car was collected and returned efficiently. The receptionist I spoke to was very helpful along with Wesley who dealt with my car and Gareth who did the collection / valeting. Very pleased with the technician's work. I will definitely be returning to VW Macclesfield.
11/17/17,5,"All done perfectly that´s supposed to be done, car is running well"
11/17/17,4,"Overall experience of trading in my car & buying an audi made efficient and stress free by salesman David. Phoned inquiring about a car on the Saturday and drove it away on the Thursday. Everything explained, my husband took over negotiation and managed to get a better deal. Paperwork dealt with quickly and efficiently. Davids attention to detail was appreciated. Overall I would definitely recommend, I have a stunning car without the usual headache of trading in."
11/17/17,2,"Good service. Polite staff, but not really bothered. Had to wait over an hour Erving a text to say my car was ready, with no one seeming to know why or care."
11/17/17,4,Good friendly service and completed within time given
11/17/17,5,"I get my Skoda serviced at Inchcape and invariably it is a trouble-free experience. This last time it was particularly smooth as I didn't even have to pay to insure the courtesy car. The car was ready when I expected and I was rung up to confirm when it would be available. All done and, of course, clenaed up."
11/17/17,5,"Took my GT86 for it's service and first MOT, and received excellent service and customer care. Thank you"
11/17/17,5,"My car was booked in for a 20,000 mile service and I chose a sit and wait appointment. Very comfortable waiting area, tea, coffee, magazines, very friendly staff, checking I was ok every so often. I got a price for my service in advance and when it came to paying it was actually a little cheaper than quoted. Invoice thoroughly explained, they were able to answer all my questions and I left feeling extremely satisfied. The video of the health check you receive is a nice touch too."
11/17/17,5,Very pleased with our new BMW and the customer service
11/17/17,5,Would be very happy to use again in future and would recommend.
11/17/17,1,"Changing 2 tyres took 3 hours with no explanation or clarification of why. Following day, one of new tyres had major drop in pressure meaning I had to take time out of my day to visit KwikFit to have it checked. Nothing wrong with tyre (no puncture or leaks) so car has to go back to Cobham (round trip 100 miles) so they can sort out their error.
The slogans about perfect service are just that Slogans"
11/17/17,5,"Did just what it said on the can, quick and easy.

Really liked the Audi cam, very useful. My advisor was very friendly and professional. Thank you."
11/17/17,5,"Excellent, courteous communications, positive planning of date, excellent pick-up and delivery service. Good feedback. Vehicle service and MOTexcellent."
11/17/17,5,"Great service and attention to detail from handing over my car for service / tyres to receiving it back.
Ask for Jack Rains and you know your car will be in good hands"
11/17/17,5,"Great service, efficient as always. Great hospitality and a nice place to have a super selection of hot drinks, watch TV and read the papers and, of course, look at all the fabulous cars. My Smart was in for a recall and the work was completed to my satisfaction and it was washed and hoovered too."
11/17/17,5,"Friendly welcome, kept to the timeframe they stated and called me as soon as it was completed. All in all a very easy process."
11/17/17,5,"Very good service today, no problems,
?"
11/17/17,5,"Excellent service, walked out with the car I wanted with I could afford. Loved the experience from beginning to end"
11/17/17,5,I couldn’t fault Coopers whatsoever. They are the most helpful dealership I have been too. The staff go beyond all expectations to make sure you are happy with everything and it was all explained as they went along. I will definitely be taking my vehicle back to them
11/17/17,5,"Very impressive service, in actual fact absolutely astounding. My car was collected, I had a video of my car on the ramp doing a health check, and that was pretty amazing as it was sent through to my phone!
The service was A+++."
11/17/17,4,"Coopers - what can you say?

They have been for a number of years since our dealings a professional and excellent car dealer, constantly 4 or 5 stars. They do what they say."
11/17/17,5,Very good experience at this service. Your advisor Henry did a great job.
11/17/17,5,"Very helpful and efficient service. Friendly, polite staff. My only criticism is that my VW UP has only done 12500 miles in five years. Therefore I feel that some major replacements that should I think be on a mileage basis are recommended on the age of the car. For example a new cam belt at a cost of £484. However, this garage does not recommend replacements that are not strictly necessary, they are fair and you have the choice of whether to accept work or not. For an older woman particularly, a very non stressful experience."
11/16/17,4,"Unlike a lot of people I don’t actually enjoy the process of buying a car. Although my experience was fair with Audi unfortunately the lady I originally dealt with left so I was passed over to another salesperson- which was fine as she was helpful and responsive. More than I can say about the Audi online service which I found frustrating slow and inaccurate at times. Again unfortunately I was passed over on my hand over due to leave clashing with my time available for collection which lead to an annoying wait some 20 minutes past my appointment time due to a ‘walk-in’ with the salesman I’d been booked in with - not such a professional finish sadly. Perhaps the lack of commission for him affected his time keeping?
I am extremely pleased with the car so far and wonder what my salesperson will have to say about the hand over experience when I get the follow up call! 🤔"
11/16/17,5,"Great experience from start to finish. Thank you very much to Craig P.(sales executive) . Friendly and professional attitude towards customer. Can honestly say that I'm very happy customer, I also had the best coffee of the week."
11/16/17,2,Had booked car in for 9am with courtesy car. On arrival told no courtesy car available but Enterpise Hire Car which was not a problem in principle. Took 10mins to check in whilst service assistant contacted parts re brake fluid for pre-arranged brake fluid service. Then asked to wait to see Car Rental operative. Eventually seen at 920 to be told he would need to ring to get courtesy vehicle delivered ( as Dealerhsip did not advise when vehicles required) after protest I was given only vehicle on site which was minibus! My decision as I could not wait any longer. eventually got off to work at 925. Do not think this is acceptable level of service. in fairness all work was done well and in timely fashion but for a premium brand if I book for a set time with courtesy car expect dealership to be ready for me. Just do not get any sense that Coopers BMW put the customer first.
11/16/17,5,"Excellent service! Thank you , Coopermini!"
11/16/17,5,Very happy with the service. Looked after and felt I was a valued customer
11/16/17,3,"Dismayed at having to wait so long to pay for my MOT and collect my car, and that I did not get the free safety inspection I was promised."
11/16/17,1,"I would seriously not recommend the Nottingham, Toyota dealership. I drove away in my car at the end of August and I am still waiting for the breakdown and warrenty paperwork. I have been promised on numerous occasions the paperwork will be emailed/posted but it was never sent. The evasive answers, the impatience to get me off the phone was unbelievable. I don't think for one moment there was ever any policies it was a ploy to sell the car. I have emailed the Inchcape head office, again I have just been ignored.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!"
11/16/17,5,"I was really impressed by the professional and friendly manner of the lady who dealt with me. I was astounded that I had only taken my 12 year old Rav 4 because of a recall, but the car was examined and reported on plus washed and cleaned. Thank you so much

Would highly recommend Toyota and I would always buy one"
11/16/17,5,"I went knowing I was in negative equity as I only had my car a short while but my situation had changed an needed a bigger car. The staff at cooper BMW sunderland could not have helped any more than they did, reception staff to salesmen to managers were excellent. Very pleased with the out come and will be returning in the few years and hopefully the staff are the same. Jodi Mitchell was the salesman I dealt with and he was great, could have had a beter experience."
11/16/17,5,Excellent friendly customer care and a wonderful car with no hard sell.
11/16/17,5,Great service as ever!
11/16/17,5,Good prompt service
11/16/17,5,Fantastic service from the word go. Very welcoming and pleasant staff and seen to straight away. Issue sorted straight away and very impressed with courtesy car. Great to see good honest customer care from the start
11/16/17,2,"Showroom badly needs updating. Strange atmosphere. Standard dealership “upsell” tactics after “vehicle health-check”. I say upsell because you could have the same parts and work done, safely, elsewhere. Customer parking tight and haphazard forecourt ."
11/16/17,5,"I've never bought a new car so quickly or effortlessly thanks to Neil Cameron at Macclesfield Inchcape Audi. We viewed on Sunday and drove it away on Friday, personalised registration and all paperwork sorted without tantrums (mine, usually) Everything was managed without any hassle thanks to Neil who managed to keep smiling even when I couldnt replicate my signature .... I also had the best coffee of the week when I called in to complete the necessary documents. Thank you and well done."
11/16/17,5,"Friendly and efficient Service team.
Helpful technicians who came out on road test and were then able to diagnose and rectify 'clonking' noise from the car's drive train.

Overall a very good service experience - exactly as I've come to expect from HA Fox Jaguar. Will certainly be looking to use them again for servicing and fault diagnosis."
11/16/17,5,"This was my first visit to Inchape Southend and would not hesitate to use again! I was seen by both Tom and Caroline when dropping off/picking up my car for a Service and can honestly say that it was the best experience I have had from a Service Department, everything was very easy and straight forward and I was contacted, as promised, when my car was ready. A first class service with staff to be proud off....well done Inchcape!"
11/16/17,1,"I took my car in for a service and found the level of customer care to be fine
My car had to go back in as I needed a new tyre which at the time of the service was not in stock
On my return visit I felt my treatment was pretty offhand. Perhaps the job was too small for them to be bothered
The receptionist was cool and functional
On leaving the car I was asked if I wanted a free valet which I agreed to
On collecting my car this had certainly not been done inside the vehicle
On picking the car up I was kept walking and had to challenge them about the delay
I was told I was behind another customer in the queue but the waiting area was deserted
Having been given my keys back I asked where my car was and in an offhand way was basically told it was somewhere in the car park -which was vast and full
It took me 5 minuets to find my car
I was pretty hacked off by the whole experience hence the negative review"
11/16/17,5,Another great experience with the service department.
11/16/17,4,"Started using this franchise because of the arrogant shoddy service from another franchise (not Inchcape).

Texted me day before to remind me of the appointment as well as to remind me to bring my docs since I was to to have a courtesy car. Pity I was not reminded to leave my log book, which I inadvertently took back home with me. Staff did not advise me that the courtesy car had already had a knock. Only realised when I parked the car and so had to phone up to make sure they knew about it. Going over the car as is usual before taking out a hire may have avoided this. Otherwise a good service, which I was happy with and so would recommend. Especially since I was given a little discount off the advertised cost of my service."
11/16/17,5,Excellent service. All the staff very helpful. Good experience.😀. Did recommended to friends.
11/16/17,5,"I was treated as an important customer from the moment I walked into the showroom. The staff are respectful, considerate and very friendly. The aftercare service seems very promising and I'm looking forward to being a long-standing customer."
11/16/17,5,Prompt and reliable
11/16/17,5,"very prompt, all aspects were addressed well"
11/16/17,5,"nice place, nice staff!"
11/16/17,5,"Took my wife's 3 series BMW in for its annual service. Very professional, courteous experience from beginning to end. Good advice from Marc on BMW's service plan (good value for money in my opinion). First time with Cooper BMW as the car is new and was bought from another BMW dealer, but happy with the service received."
11/16/17,5,Looked after extremely well and very courteously
11/16/17,5,No problems. Easy drop off and pick up. Video sent to m mobile of condition of tyres and brake pads whilst up on ramp was impressive. Car valeted on return and able to speak direct face to face with the technician. Impressive service
11/16/17,5,"Friendly and courteous staff before, during and after my car was serviced."
11/16/17,5,Excellent customer service received
11/16/17,4,"My Allroad was booked in for an oil and filter change as I think that however good oils are these days 18K in a new engine is too long. I had agreed to wait whilst the service took place and arrived slightly early for my 9.15 appointment.
My service manager pointed out that I was due in at 07.30 and was a little taken aback when I handed him my iPhone to show him the service confirmation text from Inchcape Audi showing 9.15! (Also had an email confirming 9.15 too.)
I was concerned that this would delay things greatly but Matt did his best to address the issue and I left the premises some three hours later. I have arthritis in the spine so didn't enjoy hanging about an hour longer than anticipated but Matt did explain that a software update took longer than expected and also apologised.
Inchcape Audi have a new 'Executive' lounge to wait in. Because of my infirmity I am always aware of poor seating and although the furniture might look smart it is hardly somewhere to chill for a couple of hours unless you are booked in to see an osteopath after your visit.
There was a coffee machine but it wasn't working properly when I arrived. A lady from the front desk came and fixed it and also turned the sound off the apparently always necessary TV which was kind. There is 'free' wifi but to get on the 'cloud' you have to sign up to agree to have every detail of your life shared and also to agree to receive marketing information. I didn't think that was a good idea or my concept of 'free' either. Apparently you could order food from Greggs to be delivered but even if you were prepared to risk a grievously lardy sausage roll, it wasn't clear how it could be ordered. Also there was a distinct absence of biccies in the cooky jar! The answer to all of the above was to take a wander down to Costa - a five minute walk.
Anyway three hours after my arrival and after a clear explanation of what had been done to my vehicle and payment made I had my valeted car returned. I also liked seeing the video Audi did during the service. Nice touch.
I'm not a fan of software changes - somehow its changed the clock time and the autobrake, when at a standstill, has thrown a wobbly a few times since.
However the four stars are deserved. For five: review appointments procedure to ensure you have the same details as the customer, buy some decent chairs from furniture village, provide free wifi and lay on a biscuit or two!
P. Radford.

p.s how do you adjust the clock on an A6 Allroad?!
p.p.s please connect power to the RS6 Estate in the showroom which looks stunning but whose seat won't adjust!"
11/16/17,5,"For the annual service and MOT of my A3, I received the same extremely high level of service and customer focus I have become accustomed to from TW Audi. Cannot fault them in any way, only well deserved praise. Thanks Steve and the team."
11/16/17,5,"Arrived at the scheduled time to be greeted wonderfully and then took all my details whilst having a coffee.
Whilst the car was being serviced I received an update on progress regularly from Mark Williams who was very knowledgable and shared all the relevant paperwork thoroughly at the end.
I then received a video showing me the issues with any worn parts. Excellent all round service from 3 colleagues."
11/16/17,5,"Very helpful and friendly staff. Carl regularly contacted us to keep us aware of what was happening. I liked it that the manager Chris came and introduced himself and did negotiations directly with us, rather than being some aloof figure."
11/16/17,5,"From the moment I was greeted and till the time I left I was impressed with the professional approach by all members of staff,the explanation of the invoice was clear and precise."
11/16/17,5,excellent service
11/16/17,5,"Very efficient, friendly and helpful service"
11/16/17,5,"Car collected on time, good communication from dealership"
11/16/17,5,"Very courteous and welcoming reception staff who were very efficient - minimum time spent waiting. Quick service, car was ready earlier than expected, clear explanations."
11/16/17,5,"I was booked in for an airbag recall for my Audi Q3 and the work was completed on time with the added bonus of a free Wash and Vac. The ladies at Reception were warm and welcoming, and Stacey who did the paperwork was cheerful and very obviously knew what she was doing. About the only downside was the video the dealership emailed to me afterwards - a nice touch to send one at all, but it wasn't my car! However, no complaints - at Cheshire Oaks you feel valued. Another plus point - the day before checking in I got an email and phone reminder of my appointment. Very useful, thank you. In fact I was so impressed I stayed on to talk to Henry in Sales and then another Henry (Hughes), the Sales Exec who sold me my Q3, and later to Jonathan, Finance Manager. They showed interest in my Q3 experience and were informative about Audi latest developments and - well, you guessed it, I have upgraded my car and pick up the new one next week!"
11/16/17,5,Fast quick appointment making. No fuss.Efficient. Pleasant staff. Car returned in clean condition.
11/16/17,5,"It’s VW what can I say, always a class act. Had 2 packs of Auto Glym waiting for me in the Car as well after it had been serviced."
11/16/17,5,"Fabulous service, am so happy, I asked for a pick up and drop off and this happened without any issue, really impressed."
11/16/17,5,"Always have very good service at Cooper Durham. Staff very friendly. Would recommend for buying a car and after sales.

ADDITIONAL INFO
Finally bought a car from Cooper Durham, excellent service and a great deal. Very pleased with the car I chose too."
11/16/17,5,"Courteous staff, comfortable waiting area, job started early and finished early too. Explanation of findings during the service clear and well documented."
11/16/17,5,Great experience form start to finish thanks to Tony. The car is very good but the customer service is out of this world. Tony is your man if you need a car!
11/16/17,5,Excellent customer service
11/16/17,4,Inchcape Warrington carried out the safety recall on my vehicle in less than one hour. They also carried out a visual check of the vehicle.
11/16/17,3,"I was booked in for a repair and I was asked what time I would be dropping my vehicle off. I said 8.15 and yet when I arrived I was told to take a seat. At 8.40 no one had still been to see me so I went back to reception and explained I needed to be at work for a meeting and asked how long it was going to take. Someone eventually came to me at 8.50 but had got the wrong vehicle details and had got me mixed up with someone else of the same surname. After waiting around again, someone completed the paperwork and showed me to my hire car only to find that the paperwork had been completed for the wrong hire car. So I had to go back in again with the advisor whilst she submitted the correct hire car details on the paperwork. All in all I didn’t get to work until 9.30 and was late for my meeting, I only bought my first Mercedes this year so this was my first experience with Inchcape and to be honest it wasn’t a great experience. I was impressed that when I picked my car up at night, it had been valeted and I really liked the video that I was sent during the day to show what other checks had been completed on my vehicle. These extras that would ordinarily have been outstanding to me as a customer, were overshadowed by the stress I had in dropping the car off in the morning."
11/16/17,4,Generally very good service and Alex always answered any questions I had very promptly. Some great touches like videos etc. Only disappointment is that the windscreen on my used vehicle has a number of small areas of damage and I only found out about these when I saw the MOT certificate ...and now I always see them especially as they seem to catch the light when driving. Mini repainted some minor scratch on the car and I think should have replaced the windscreen but by the time I became aware of the windscreen I had already committed to buy the car and they declined to do so.... love the car but hate the windscreen
11/16/17,5,Adrian was great what a guy im loving my S3
11/15/17,5,Very good service. Friendly and professional attitude towards customers. Relaxed atmosphere. The team made me feel very welcome. Everything done as they promised and they even run extra miles to make me totally happy. I would highly recommend Tetbury Audi and I definitely will keep in touch and use this garage again. I can honestly say that I am a very happy customer. 👍👍👍
11/15/17,5,"Service done in prime quality.
Took my mini clubman for it's first service, had no problem, also software was updated, car came back very clean, service 10/10."
11/15/17,5,"Easy, friendly, no hassle"
11/15/17,5,"I hate buying new cars. Manufacturer dealerships historically for me have been rip off merchants and rarely seriously interested and helpful.

We visited Cooper Malton in response to an advertised used Countryman which alas was sold when we arrived. However their team, essentially Carl and Jordan attentively questioned us about our needs. We were looking to reduce from 2 cars a 10 yr old faithful workhorse Mercedes A class recently ""written off"" and my wife's rather frivolous 3 yr old Mini Convertible to a single car capable being a workhorse and fun.
Being my wife, Mrs A had specific ideas about what she wanted in her car particularly pale leather seats and interior sun roof automatic and etc. It soon became apparent these wishes could be best fulfilled by a new built to order Mini Clubman. Their advice was that the Clubman would in-fact suit our needs more closely than the Countryman.

We spent around 4 hours choosing options considering the deal and at around 6.00pm getting close to the deal when I said but I haven't driven one it was no problem and I took an impressive test drive in the new Clubman demonstrator at around 6.30 pm. Taking a test drive after dark is a good idea. I was beginning to have some empathy for these guys they worked a bit harder than most, because as I had been in my working life, they were a bit out on a limb and had to.
We collected our built to order yesterday 2 days short of 4 weeks since ordering it. It seems just what we needed and is certainly well equipped and comfortable.

More over as we collected our new car their staff were busy selling the one we part exchanged which they did. This made us feel they are indeed a hard working enterprising unit who look after their customers well and are not so greedy as many dealerships unfortunately are."
11/15/17,2,car dirty had to clean windows inside finger marks on paint work were not shown how to use any part of the car just the sat nav but only because we asked could not park outside because all disability spaces full with cars from service dept very rudely spoken to by employee never know treatment like this before never had an apology never had a phone call after delivery to see if every thing was ok which I have never known before thoroughly diisgusted
11/15/17,5,"Great service. Even reminded me when I’d forgotten. What more could want? Excellent Merc, excellent care"
11/15/17,4,Very helpful staff and a lovely clean car at the end!
11/15/17,5,Very organised and helpful
11/15/17,5,Fantastic service. Very knowledgeable and helpful sales without being too pushy. Phil Graylen was superb. Definitely recommend.
11/15/17,5,"Another great job from the team at Derby-Mercedes,from Drop off to Pick up.
Many thanks,
John W Robinson"
11/15/17,2,"Hunters at Peasmarsh was previously Guava. I had nothing but excellent service there with several Discoverys, my Defender and my wife's Freelander. Will and James could not do enough for me to sort out the problems I had over the years, great people and a great garage, however since this has become Hunters the service has gone significantly down hill and I will not be using them again. Hunters were unable to fix the problem I had (it took four visits) and are significantly more expensive than Guava were. There is a real opportunity for a service minded LandRover dealer in the Guildford area ..."
11/15/17,4,"Excellent experience.
Great car and a great company. We dealt with Ashley who was more than helpful throughout the whole process.
Now to enjoy the car
Would recommend and will return in the future."
11/15/17,5,Excellent service from everyone.Did a good service on my F.Pace.
11/15/17,4,"Very pragmatic, not pushy, friendly, efficient. My wife was annoyed with me that they didn't put a bunch of flowers in the new car for her, so I had to buy her some."
11/15/17,5,Great service and car was cleaner than it had been after the complementary clean.
11/15/17,4,If the service and value for money remain the level I have had for the past three years I will not look any further for my car requirements. the staff are more than helpful pleasant and good to deal with - both front of house and back. thank you
11/15/17,5,"All ways good to deal with, attentive, pleasant, but not overly pushy staff."
11/15/17,5,"I was contacted the day before the service was scheduled. I had intended to wait the two hours duration. (Their coffee is lovely!) The service would take at least half a day as there were programmes to be updated. I was immediately offered a car for the day even though I only needed to travel a few miles home. When the service was completed, I found the car was almost like new.
Very happy with the whole experience."
11/15/17,5,Did what was needed with no fuss or bother
11/15/17,5,Really warm atmosphere nice friendly genuwine staff not sales people real humans trust me had a service done will be defo going back 10/10.
11/15/17,5,Good service at very short notice
11/15/17,5,"Been using them for nearly 6 years now, great people, great service."
11/15/17,5,Very good service
11/15/17,5,completed the work on time and even washed the car.the staff at Cooper Mini York are extremely pleasant and friendly and very professional.the showroom is also of a high standard and very welcoming.
11/15/17,5,"The car went in following a recall notice. Job done in very quick time. Also a total vehicle inspection took place because of a potential rear NS bearing problem. In the end nothing found and the car's condition was marked as excellent. Very happy with Cooper BMW they are professional, helpful and generous with their time in my experience."
11/15/17,5,"Looked after from arrival, loan car and Collection.
Everything explained very clearly and professionally by Jo"
11/15/17,5,"Great service - I left my car for service at 1.30pm (oil, brake fluid replacement and MOT). All completed, washed and cleaned for collection at 3.30pm - thanks to Josh, Service Advisor. Very happy."
11/15/17,5,Booked car in for service. Had a phone call before to check all was ok I amended the collection point this was amended with no problem. Service work was carried out to usual high standard and vehicle returned back in plenty of time for me to return home
11/15/17,5,"A very friendly and professional experience with all the staff. Neil who sold us our new Q3 was most helpful and took a personal interest in us as a couple, keeping us up to date through the whole process. We both felt valued as customers and the quality of the amenities are excellent."
11/15/17,5,Excellent service and staff from start to finish
11/15/17,5,Professional service and reasonable price. I would recommend this company to everyone.
11/15/17,5,"Adam was wonderful ,the car was wonderful .It was a pleasure giving you my money."
11/15/17,5,I get excellent service from Mercedes Loughborough who collect my car and return it to my house on completion. Car always returned spotlessly clean. I recommend this dealership to anyone wanting quality service.
11/15/17,5,"Can't say enough good stuff about Inchcape, since I moved into the area I have had my car Mot'd - had a summer /autumn check which included my aircon re-gassed (for a lot less cost than the VW garage where i used to be in the Southwest quoted me) I have also just had a thorough winter and tyre check, all for free - and they even washed my car - in fact they've washed my car each time its been in.
These guys are absolutely A1 - I cant ask for better service than I get, everyone in the place is really knowledgeable and very customer orientated - such a friendly lot too. Thanks again Inchcape"
11/15/17,5,"I never thought I would be able to say this about care salesmen or about buying a car. But the whole experience provided by Martin and the team at Inchcape Warrington was a pleasure from start to finish. Very professional and an enjoyable service.
However, I would advise potential customers to check the cost of the Asset protection (GAP) insurance offered by Inchcape against the cost of similar policies that are readily available from other providers, before buying from the dealer.
I was unaware that the GAP insurance was available from anyone other than the dealer but it is and at a much lower premium"
11/15/17,5,"Friendly professional staff and quick
Efficient service"
11/15/17,5,"An excellent service, professional in every detail"
11/15/17,3,"The service was average, MB Leics would not let me supply the oil which I could purchase at 1/2 the charged price, when I asked if they would price match they also refused. This is an accepted practice and something I do and have no problem with on my other cars Porsche & Peugeot.
I would also prefer to have a service desk where we could see the service personnel and know if and how long we need to wait to be attended. In MB Leics we are ushered to a seating area and left to wait until a member of the service team comes from behind closed doors to attend to requirements. I am also very surprised that you are charged for a courtesy car which is something I have never been asked to pay for before. It is not a courtesy car its a hire car !!"
11/15/17,5,"Exceptional friendly service from Cooper BMW York. What a complete contrast to Park Lane BMW in London!!!
This dealership has restored my faith in the brand."
11/15/17,5,"Great service from all members of staff, excellent video report and electronic updates. First rate. Much better than historic experiences with other VW garages."
11/15/17,5,"Excellent, efficient, helpful and very pleasant, I have had poor levels of service from other Audi Dealers (not too far away) and as such don't generally relish having to visit them but Maidstone Audi was first class. Thank you."
11/15/17,3,"My car was recalled ny Mercedes for essential work. It was booked in for 2pm and the work, I was told, would take ‘about an hour’. It actually took 1 hr 35 mins but noone bothered to come and tell me. There was also a video done of the car. Maybe this was why it all took so long!"
11/15/17,5,I had a very good experience my car was serviced and mot I received a higher car which you have to pay £10 for the insurance which is very reasonable and my car was washed and valeted when I picked it up all in all I am very pleased with the service I received
11/15/17,5,"From first contact to completion of work, I was impressed with the courteous and professional way I, and the work undertaken, was dealt with. Thank you Inchcape Guildford.
R Bovill"
11/15/17,5,"Great customer service, painless experience."
11/15/17,5,"Very professional service. Well that was what it was, a 20,000 mile service.
Car returned in perfect order and so, so clean. I hardly recognised it!!

Thank you Inchcape."
11/15/17,5,"An excellent experience during a service, as I have come to expect."
11/15/17,5,"Prompt and efficient, friendly service. The car came back washed and vacuumed and we'll ahead of the expected time"
11/15/17,5,"From the moment my X5 was taken if for service and finished was excellent.
My car was looked after by a gentlemen in servicing called Ashleigh and he was superb from stat to finish. Very professional"
11/15/17,5,"I have been having my Lexus cars serviced by Lexus, Derby for many years now and have always been delighted with the work carried out and the service received from all the staff at that branch.

A short time ago we moved home from near Derby to live in Leicestershire but, having tried the Lexus dealership in Leicester and found them to be generally acceptable, I have realised that the service offered by Derby cannot be equalled and so, although it's quite a distance, Derby will definitely continue to get my business for the foreseeable future.

The team there are totally dedicated to offering a first class service. Well done to all at Lexus, Derby!"
11/15/17,4,"The service department is excellent and have been very helpful. I appreciate very much how the car is cleaned inside and out after being at the garage.

I still find the reception staff difficult - they leave messages on my answer phone, speaking so fast I cannot hear it properly. They are not very friendly."
11/15/17,5,"From the first visit to the last and collecting our car what a day to remember, excellent."
11/15/17,5,"I always find Audi Macclesfield very friendly and accommodating, and this visit was no exception. You are always made very welcome with a welcoming coffee and Lee Machin is a very obliging sales person giving you a first class service"
11/15/17,4,No problems or delays and had a clean courtesy car
11/15/17,5,Excellent service
11/15/17,5,"""First Class"" Service from the Service and Parts Dept."
11/15/17,5,"Great experience at VW during my first service. Andy was very helpful and made me feel welcome and well looked after. I enjoyed having a coffee while watching my car being serviced, which did not take long at all. I appreciate the courtesy wash and hoover for my car (which was very much needed). Overall I was very satisfied with the service, and would highly recommend Inchcape VW!"
11/15/17,5,"Great service, great people"
11/15/17,5,"I am really impressed with Inchcape Audi. Not only did they match the service price I had been quoted by an independent garage, but they also did the MOT for free. On top of that they collected & delivered the car, and even gave it a wash & vac. Impossible to improve on - many thanks!!"
11/15/17,5,From booking to completion of the service all ran smoothly
11/15/17,5,"The staff were excellent, very helpful explained every thing I enquired about. The car was serviced on time and clean and valetted."
11/15/17,5,"Easily organised appointment. My car was taken in for its MOT as soon as I arrived and I was made very welcome by both reception and service staff. The MOT was completed on time and the car fully valeted. On returning home, a video was awaiting me as an email attachment showing me the state of the underside of the car, the tyres, brake pads etc. Excellent and very professional service all round."
11/14/17,5,"Very friendly and professional staff from the security guard, through to the reception staff and finally the Service Representative Rodney, who was excellent. Inchcape have restored my faith in VW."
11/14/17,5,"5* service, staff great"
11/14/17,5,"Having looked for the best quote on Carwow, I choose the local agent . Some years ago I found them disinterested and arrogant, but give them all credit, they have changed significantly for the better. Purchasing my new vehicle was a good experience. The staff polite and engaging."
11/14/17,5,Really good service all way through the dealer that I dealt with was Phil cox if you use this dealership ask for him was he was really good
11/14/17,1,"East Kent Audi, Canterbury. Dreadful service and shocking prices, mixed with arrogance, incompetence and downright stupidity. Made appointment over phone, telling them exactly what problems were and what part needed replacing. Was told I needed to pay £60 for them to diagnose problems, despite my having told them what they were; I reluctantly agreed. Took car in 3 days later for appointment. Was then told what I described amounted to two separate problems not one, so in fact 'diagnostic' fee would be £120, even though it all related to same part (the part I had already told them needed replacing). I disputed charges saying I had already told them what what problems were and how to fix them, but was told there was no option; it would take an hour to diagnose both problems, so I had to pay. Reluctantly agreed as I needed genuine Audi part and proper fitting. Was called later that day by receptionist saying they had diagnosed problems and they needed to order necessary part, but car ready to collect until part arrived. When I clarified with engineer what work had been done he confirmed the cause of both problems was the part I had told them about 3 days earlier, but they'd not ordered it in and no remedial work had been done. It therefore clear car not ready to collect as one of problems was heavy leak of engine coolant - not safe to drive it any distance. He agreed I shouldn't collect, but leave car there until part arrived. Work completed 4 days after I took it in, and was charged nearly £600 to fit a part that costs approx £100 and takes an hour to fit. Given that I had told them what the problems were and what part needed replacing they agreed to waive the £120 diagnostic fee; would otherwise have been nearly £800 inc VAT. I last used this branch 3 years ago to sort a problem with ABS. After spending nearly £1000 to get it sorted, car promptly spun 180 degrees going round a corner as brakes were totally defective and gripping unevenly. Potentially lethal after being in their workshop. Swore I'd never go back, but decided I had to this time. Thoroughly regret it and won't do it again. They have shoddy workmanship and customer service, but charge the highest possible rates. They treat their customers like idiots and as an inconvenience if you not in market to buy a new car. Dreadful from start to finish."
11/14/17,3,"Customer service provided in relation to vehicle service excellent as ever. 5 star rating in relation to this.

Reason for Lower Customer Service Score
Had asked to speak to someone regarding purchase of new vehicle in next 6-8 months, in particular part exchange value of my current car at the point of dropping car off for service/MOT.

Despite being in the dealership for 2.5hours nobody came to speak to me.

Was informed at the point of vehicle collection that someone would call me to discuss new vehicle at a later time (contacted whilst driving home) however i wanted a face to face discussion and so will look elsewhere when changing car."
11/14/17,5,Great product and sales team
11/14/17,5,"Friendly staff,fast service and fair price!"

11/14/17,5,"Great retailer all staff very helpful & nice, Service department very helpful."
11/14/17,5,"Very helpful
Upset that no floor mats in my new Mini."
11/14/17,5,They're not my closest Mini dealer but Cooper Mini provided a pick up and drop off service and a video review of my car. Very happy with service
11/14/17,5,Another excellent experience with Cooper BMW. Came in for MOT and car was ready at the time agreed for collection. Service rep was very helpful and professional throughout.
11/14/17,4,"Very good service from the moment I walked into the showroom. I was there to leave my current car for service and asked to test drive the new PHEV Countryman ~ when I left I was converted. I was taken through the process of ordering my new car by Marny who was courteous and professional throughout. The only minor complaint I have, and the reason for not giving 5 stars, is I found one of the managers a little rude."
11/14/17,5,"Had my Touran in for its first service yesterday and found it to be a prompt and hasslefree experience. I was attended to promptly and pleasantly, provided with a courtesy car as requested and my vehicle was available for collection at the agreed time. I was also sent a video of the vehicle inspection that was undertaken during the service. Perfectly happy and hope this is typical of the service I will receive in my future dealings with them."
11/14/17,4,"I arrived on the dot of 8 am but had to wait 15 minutes to hand over the keys etc - rather too long. There were no daily papers to read. The car was given a minor service very quickly. It was interesting to see the video showing the underneath etc of the car but it was very difficult to hear what the engineer was saying about the tyres and brake discs because of background noise. I had quite a wait again when I picked up the car at 2 pm. I was then told that the left wiper was smearing. I think I should have been telephoned about that during the service as I would have said: Replace it, please. The alternative would have been an extra wait after I arrived to pick it up, which I did not want. I was very grateful for the help I was given just before leaving to link my iPhone to the car."
11/14/17,5,Excellent polite knowledgable service
11/14/17,5,My car was returned as part of Mercedes recall. Having contacted Inchcape Mercedes Warrington the task was quick and easy. My appointment was made and totally customer focused. On arrival at the garage I was greeted friendly and professionally and the whole process took no more than 40 minutes.
11/14/17,5,"Work carried out quickly. Inchcape gave me a lift home whilst work was being carried out, & collected me & took me back to Inchcape to pick up my car, once work was completed. They also washed my car, & were courteous throughout."
11/14/17,5,"Very efficient, recommended."
11/14/17,5,Prompt attentive service. Good communication
11/14/17,5,"Wow. Bought an RS6. Great service. If only my local dealer was this good.
From the first call to the day the car was delivered the service and hospitality I received was amazing. Clive Dury was pleasant and professional and made the sale smooth. Even delivered the car personally (3 hours drive away). I’m a customer for life. Highly recommend these guys. Totally amazing."
11/14/17,4,"The experience was fine,everything went well."
11/14/17,5,"Excellent service, as anticipated"
11/14/17,5,Excellent experience. My car was collected & returned making the whole process stress free & easy.
11/14/17,5,"Excellent service, works and costs always explained. Video health check a great plus."
11/14/17,5,We dealt with Yasmin Bergmanis and bought a Mini Cooper S. We were impressed with her product knowledge and professional attitude throughout and wouldn't hesitate to recommend her if you are interested in buying a new or used Mini. A pleasure to deal with throughout. Thank you.
11/14/17,5,"The moment I arrived I was greeted by a very friendly young staff of your and lead me to reception straight away to see Debbie, that’s was swift no waiting and get down to business, awesome make me feel great very VIP, happy experience & again lead me to my courtesy car , update my car progress & all jobs done by 4.30 excellent service , great dealership."
11/14/17,5,"5 star experience dealing with Mini Thames Ditton, this was down to our salesman KarlJoslin."
11/14/17,5,"Fantastic service from being to end of car purchase, with the same Sales Executive to guide you through the process. Very knowledgable staff, nothing too much trouble. Would highly recommend H A Fox, Jaguar and Ash Brear who was a star ... thankyou."
11/14/17,5,Very helpful.
11/14/17,5,"Fantastic service at Mercedes Benz of Coventry in October. I took my car in for a service I was looked after by Marcus, he made sure that everything was in place for my courtesy car and that I was kept up to date about my vehicle. I especially like the video that was sent to me in a text and email showing me the underside of my vehicle and the true wear readings as they were being done, fantastic idea to keep customers up to date. So overall exceptional service by Marcus and the whole team in the workshop who no doubt usually don’t get a mention. Very happy customer."
11/14/17,4,"Very pleased with all the help I received from MINI York garage. Did a good job, and looks good as new when finished it!"
11/14/17,5,Excellent service from start to finish - I am now the proud owner of a Mini Countryman! No pushy salespeople - knowledgeable and friendly staff provided all the information and support needed and after sales as well.
11/14/17,5,very helpful and am looking to change car also
11/14/17,4,Great experience from Mercedes. No pressure just great service.

11/14/17,4,"Good service, good people, no problems...."
11/14/17,5,Excellent Service
11/14/17,5,"They do what it says on the tin, on time, on budget, no fuss."
11/14/17,5,"The visit was simply to obtain a MOT certificate. On the day, the MOT ramp had developed a fault requiring my car to be taken elsewhere. This was arranged under agreement with myself and the car was returned with the certificate without fuss or inconvenience."
11/14/17,3,"Normally you are a good company and very helpful. I have been very pleased with my E-Class Cabriolet and previous Mercedes cars.

You want to replace corroded brake pipes with identical ones that will corrode again. Why can't you use copper ones if you don't do them make them. It will also save time and money in the long term and a pat on the back from Mercedes I would think as I can't be the only Mercedes customer with the same pipes. I don't want a problem solved with a future problem. Maybe this should be a recall to fix this potentially dangerous issue.

Would be nice to have a sensible outcome."
11/14/17,5,great sales and after sales team
11/14/17,5,"Efficient service, Courteous staff."
11/14/17,5,"Really helpful staff, got my car sorted quickly. Couldn’t be happier with the service."
11/14/17,4,Good experience dropping off and picking up the car. Courtesy car was dirty inside though. Own car was not fully cleaned after service.
11/14/17,5,"Two recent pleasant experiences. One to buy a car and the other to buy an item for the car.
Both experiences were pleasant and both times I was met with politeness and efficiency.
I would not hesitate to recommend people to do business here."
11/14/17,5,As always excellent service from all staff
11/14/17,5,Excellent service car picked up and dropped off and nice valet as well
11/14/17,2,"I enlisted in the Toyota service plan and paid monthly in advance for two services.1st service and MOT booked for 13/11/17 mentioned to a colleague my Aygo was having a service at Toyota Sandhurst and he remarked it was going to cost me big. I told him I was on the service plan and it was therefore sorted he guareented me it would cost based on his experiences and those of his neighbours it would cost. He remarked that it was easier to regrets a charge when the service was already paid for and as I was also having a MOT the charges/faults would be related ie brakes,tyres,exhaust,battery starting motor. Sure enough it was brakes.
I tried to phone back Lauren to request she retain the old parts for me however she was with a customer and would phone me back, it never happened.the car was bought from sandhurst in December 2016 and I’d dative house less than 5,000 miles. I had my previous Toyota Aygoserviced there in July 2016 and guess what, yes brakes. I may be wrong but I do wonder. If everything is above board then I’ve no complaints except for the failure to call me back. When I’m told to expect a charge it would suggest something is wrong."
11/14/17,5,This dealership was very straight forward and easy to deal with. Great service.
11/14/17,5,"Excellent service. Staff always friendly, helpful, and efficient. Good atmosphere throughout, and good coffee."

11/14/17,5,"I received really great service from Adam helping me select a used X4. Service throughout the process excellent, CTD is a really efficient and personable dealership and I can’t recommend them highly enough!"
11/14/17,5,"customer service first class, work always carried out to a high standard."
11/14/17,5,Great service no heavy sales pitch. Pleasure to deal with!
11/14/17,5,The whole experience was very smooth and efficient. I made the booking online just a few days in advance and waited in the lounge for 2 1/4 hours by which time it was all done.
11/14/17,5,"Excellent customer service, especially from my service advisor, Paul. Easy to book in, excellent friendly advice, all work completed on schedule and personal time constraint requirements catered to."
11/14/17,5,A very nice facility and swift service made the experience of having my car serviced by Coopers of Reading great value.
11/14/17,5,"Wife’s car was showing engine light. She rang and arranged for the car to be seen urgently. The car was seen on Monday, diagnostics performed same day, text message and email of problem sent. Authorisation given for work and the sensor replaced the same day. Excellent polite service with information through texts all along."
11/14/17,5,"Car was booked for a diagnostic check on a sporadic problem. Fault was found, a price was quoted to replace a part and the job was completed the same day. Service throughot the whole process was OUTSTANDING All the staff involved were exemplory. Why can't all Dealers be this good?"
11/14/17,1,Not a good customer service they did not contact us when car is ready i told them update my adress on bill they dont they dont stamp on a book tomorrow i have to drive all the way back and correct the adress and stamped the book.am thinking hopefully they done a major service perfectly not a missed anything
11/14/17,5,Checking out a drive malfunction; all sorted and excellent customer service; lift into town and back on new electric vehicle. Usual high standard. MD Orpington
11/14/17,5,Very helpful receptionist when I booked and Kait who dealt with my mini service kept me informed of developments. Very friendly and efficient.
11/14/17,4,Really good very timely but would have been better if they could have identified the upgrade to the emissions needed instead of the need for a rebook. But otherwise excellent
11/14/17,1,"I booked for the 1 hour & 45minute service while you wait.

it took them an extra 1 hour to complete. They said nothing about the delay during or once it was done. When I stated this they said sorry and that it needed some software changes!! but why could they have not told me this during the process when they walked past me more than 10 times."
11/14/17,5,Excellent service
11/14/17,3,"Good customer service at garage. Car serviced and cleaned.
Very poor parking at garage and was blocked in when leaving causing 10 minute delay.
The garage is 15 miles away from home and only found out about the collect and delivery car service at the garage which wasted 2 hours travel time."
11/14/17,5,Top service...thanks
11/14/17,5,"Great service from the service desk, Ellie was superb throughout, arranging courtesy car and keeping in touch"
11/14/17,5,"Really attentive customer service, and also a really reasonable price didnt feel like i was being ripped off. Would definitely recommend for a service and will certainly return next year"
11/14/17,5,"Did a good job on the MOT and service, plus a couple of other items at a very fair price. I will be more than happy to use them again in the future for any work that I need. Polite and professional staff and excellent communication, so no surprises on the cost."
11/14/17,5,"We bought our Mini Countryman new from coopers in Norwich in 2014 and it had its first mot yesterday and a service, the staff as always ways were friendly and helpful and the work was was completed in a timely manner."
11/14/17,1,"I have had a problem with my key, which was an going problem since I have purchased the car. Every time I called (5 times) the battery was replaced and the problem occurred again. In my visit dated July 2017 I was told that a new key will be ordered and will replace the faulty one. I was told by Barrie from the Service department that somebody will be in touch with me to arrange a date for dealing with that. I did not hear until mid September. Then I rang to the Service Department a few times; anytime I was told by the Receptionist that Barrie is busy and will return my call. He never got back to me and I had to ring again and again. Eventually I talked to a lady who arranged for me to bring the car on Friday October 20th. I took a day off from work and called your place. Then I was welcomed by Stuart who informed me that the new key has not arrived yet and they need to liaise with VW about that. Obviously I was not very happy about that. He promised me to email me the following week with the response. Again I have not heard anything until I rang again and then another date has been arranged and the problem (hopefully ) been sorted.
I think that the whole process indicates a very poor level of service and I would be grateful if I could speak to your branch manager before sending a formal complaint to VW."
11/14/17,5,It's one of the best service provider good service good staff best comnication I advise all of my friends to use toyota either for service buyer or every things in toyota is best. Thanks a lot
11/14/17,5,Brilliant company
11/14/17,5,The first new car for our daughter. Great support and contact from first initial visit to collection of the car.
11/14/17,5,"H A Fox Southampton provide an excellent customer care service, very courteous and nothing is too much trouble for them."
11/14/17,5,As usual been servicing my cars for over 3 years now and have been more than satisfied by the service I receive how ever small the requirement they have been willing and attentative
11/14/17,5,The whole experience was very simple and everything was well explained
11/14/17,4,Everything listed for the service was completed and ahead of time my car was valeted and ready for me to drive away. I couldn’t have asked for better service.
11/14/17,5,I had a very pleasant experience buying my new Audi. Everything went smoothly and my car was received ahead of time.
11/14/17,5,"This review is not a simple process, VW excellent Trustpilot nil points!!"
11/14/17,5,Good service
11/14/17,5,Fair prices excellent service and a clean car to drive away in!!
11/14/17,3,"My car was returned with the ""Service"" light still on! I had to call the garage and arrange to take it in the next day. What an aggravating and basic mistake to make and I cannot understand why the person who returned the car to me did not notice or hear the chime."
11/14/17,5,"Brilliant service by all at Cooper mini at tonbridge , nothing is to much trouble for them , would highly recommend. Thank you Mini Cooper at Tonbridge"
11/14/17,5,Always excellent service
11/14/17,5,The experience was very good and Sophie Cooper kept me well informed of what was done and when I was able to pick up my car. Excellent all round.
11/14/17,5,"Well organised, car is ready when they say it will be. Paper work and e-mail communication all very good"
11/14/17,2,"I have no issue with the staff, courteous and professional however, having spent £37k on a car and nearly £500 on a service I find it unbelievable that they ask for £25 to hire a car whilst they service your car. This never happened with Audi."
11/14/17,5,"Excellent service by workshop, call centre gave wrong information and did not call back as promised"
11/14/17,3,"When I booked my annual service I also booked an alloy wheel refurb to be completed on the same day
Received call/vmail from service manager on Friday (service booked for following Monday + I was out of the country) telling me that alloy wheel could not be completed on the same day.
When I spoke to Inchcape after the service was completed to arrange for the alloy wheel refurb I was given a telephone number of a company in Chelmsford that can complete the work. So I have to call them myself to book it in?
Much easier for me to just book it myself with Balgores in Harold Wood. Never had this with Audi - service & alloy wheel refurb completed on the same day
Why do Inchcape advertise alloy wheel refurb when you have to end up booking it yourself with another company? Why is the process so complex? Staff obviously not aware of the procedure?"
11/14/17,5,"Great service.
The only problem I have is that your service centre keep calling me to book my service centre and MOT even though it's been done. I have now had 4 calls and getting a bit annoyed with it. Your systems need linking together somewhere."
11/14/17,3,My review appears in ‘title of your review’
11/14/17,5,Best after sales service
11/14/17,5,"Very helpful,car on time,no waiting around,and also a loan car. Would recommend this branch anytime."
11/14/17,5,"First class service and very professional staff, always polite and offering assistance,
I would use and recommend these guys every time without doubt"
11/14/17,3,"My car was recently in for a minor service. The service was completed in a timely fashion, and the car cleaned internally & externally.

However, on returning my car, I found the rear cup holder had been removed & was disassembled & lying on the rear seat. This was not subject to repair/service. I reported this and the car was returned to the workshop to effect replacement. Unfortunately the mechanism could not be refitted & I had to return the car a few days later, to have a new unit fitted, which was a pain, as the garage is not close to me"
11/14/17,5,"Typical visit, excellent service and warm welcome!"
11/14/17,5,"Service as always second to none.
The team are extremely courteous.
A memorable experience since purchasing the car ..2010"
11/14/17,5,"Great friendly service, quick tyre replacement as well."
11/14/17,5,The staff were very helpful and went out of their way to find us the right car!
11/14/17,5,Staff very helpful and efficient. Provided courtesy car and service done on time that day. Appreciated the video walk around of condition of my Mini. All in all excellent service and complete reassurance that my Mini is in tip top condition. Thank you Cooper Mini
11/14/17,5,"The service received at Coopers BMW was outstanding! My Z4 was in for a new tyre and a repair to a scratched wheel trim. Got to drive a top-of-the-range Series 4 convertible as a courtesy car - wow! I've been to Coopers three times in total since moving to East Sussex and their service is miles ahead of the other BMW dealerships I have used. If they keep this up, they have a customer for life. Hey Coopers, how much does the Series 4 retail for?!........ 😍"
11/14/17,5,Booking in procedure efficient and friendly. I was kept informed about progress of the work and they fitted in my service on the day as they saw this was due.
11/13/17,5,Service completed on time with free health check and suitable courtesy car. Wipers replaced on text confirmation.
11/13/17,5,"Excellent and straightforward transaction with Peter Cairns
Macc Audi very easy to deal with , no hassle"
11/13/17,5,"They went beyond expectations, Simon was brilliant and an excellent asset to the company"
11/13/17,5,"I purchased my used Audi A1 at Inchcape Approved Used Audi in Hyde and the weekend and I am so happy with my car! The company as a whole were great, from moving the car from one branch to another to ensure the car was closer for me to view, to the purchasing of the car. The team were so helpful and efficient they made the car buying process a breeze and I couldn’t fault my experience at all. Very happy overall."
11/13/17,5,"Just how you want a service to be - quick, easy, helpful, friendly."
11/13/17,1,"I am quite amazed that I have been asked to give a rating for Hunters. It really underlines the lack of communication within their organisation. I have filled in two questionnaires, and completed telephone feedback with a person at head office who told me after I had completed the feedback that it had been recorded and would be passed to Hunters at Norwich. How much feedback do I have to give to make somebody aware that I am a very dissatisfied customer, or is it that nobody really cares?

I had given them a second chance to give good service after a previously bad customer experience some two years ago but once again they have failed.

I will never use Hunters at Norwich again.

11/13/17,4,"Can't fault the facility, the mechanics or the service. Informative and well explained reporting. My only gripe? The poor man working in the service department and dealing with the customers was run off his feet. He needs a colleague to help him. Weekends are busy as most customers can't drop cars off during the week. Give him a buddy and you'll get 5 stars next time."
11/13/17,5,"Very happy with my mot, very good service and nice clean car on completion. Thank you very much"
11/13/17,5,Great service was well looked after by Callum highly recommended +++++++
11/13/17,5,"First class, friendly service. Always a pleasure to visit. Nothing is too much trouble."
11/13/17,2,"Third time I have chosen to have serviced at this dealer, friendly and polite reception sent me to Service desk. The young lady was talking to the service representative about the weekend. She had her back to me but the Gentlemen she was talking too could see me but chose to ignore me and carried on with the conversation. Finally after about 40 seconds, which is long time when your ignored chose to speak to me. Car booked in and a prompt Service was carried out within required timescale. Collected the vehicle but no Wash and Vacum carried out. This is a regular occurrence as I have had to ask twice before. The Wash and Vac advertising is right next to the Customer feedback notice. It's just basic customer service, carry out what you promise. Not the kind of experience I would expect from a main dealer. I will be going to BMW Southend from now on."
11/13/17,5,"I had excellent service from Carl when I called to make my first enquiry having seen the car on line through to the final instructions just before I drove my new car off the forecourt.

I never felt pushed into a sale, rather Carl listened to what I was looking for and matched my needs.

I had been to seven garages looking at different cars, including another jaguar garage, and H.A. Fox Preston won hands down even though I travelled over 100 miles.

I will be back when time comes to replace."
11/13/17,5,Excellent service! Thank you VW stockport
11/13/17,2,service was okay but my driver side door badly scraped during the service
11/13/17,5,Joe at Crawley Audi really did a great job in getting me into an amazing car. From the start of the ordering process all the way through to collection and beyond he provided the excellent level of service you would expect from a luxury brand such as Audi.
11/13/17,3,"Went for my second free service and the customer service is excellent very polite etc.My gripe is with what goes on behind the scenes.I had the service and free health check and was told my 2 shock absorbers were leaking badly and need fixing urgently at a cost of £498,I said i’ve Got a friend who is a mechanic who can sort it.He had a look at the shocks and said they were completely fine.Me thinks vw inchcape Chester don’t like doing things for free.I could list other altercations with this place.My advice is to be on the ball when dealing with them."
11/13/17,3,"Unfortunately I had to chase a quote three times and failed to receive it. The booking was for a quick turnaround due to time constraint but was actually booked for me leave the car all day.

The staff there the garage were efficient and very apologetic making sure the service was ultimately done in good time."
11/13/17,5,Great service and very efficient axplanation of work to the vehicle and also future recommendations. Excellent!
11/13/17,5,A very professional service collecting from our house. A minor breakdown in communication but dealt with very professionally and car looked fantastic. Very reassuring with the multi point check...
11/13/17,5,1st class services as usual. A special thanks to Calum and the service reception team for delivering a thoroughly professional customer service experience.
11/13/17,5,Excellent service - found the exact car we wanted.
11/13/17,3,"I sent my car in for a service and picked it up after two hours, it was washed however very poorly with lots of dirt still evident on the bodywork. The valet ting inside the car also was poor with lots of grit still evident.
When driving the car, it now does not state the gear changes on the onboard computer and I will need to resend the car in for adjustment which is a great inconvenience - further more after a new service the new service date is 1-18 only two months time with 14000 on the countdown. This is obviously an error as again the service does not need to be repeated in two months!"
11/13/17,5,Outstanding customer service
11/13/17,5,all as expected. Well looked after
11/13/17,5,"Shula was very knowledgeable and helpful. Very pleased with the work and service provided. Citnow very good.
Thanks David"
11/13/17,4,Reasonably smooth experience; my only criticism is that I think that Inchcape should highlight repairs that fall under the warrantee.
11/13/17,3,"The vehicle had to go back twice to fix a problem that should have been picked up on the first visit- a nail in the front tyre. They had advance notification that there was a problem with the tyre pressure monitoring system, so this should have been one of the first things that they checked.

The central booking line is tedious. I would rather have direct contact with the service centre.

The staff are helpful- they are just impossible to get hold of."
11/13/17,5,Everything went smoothly when my car was serviced on 7 December.
11/13/17,5,Great service
11/13/17,5,"A great customer experience with very knowledgable, professional staff. The team at HA Fox Derby were veryhelpful during the full process from selecting the vehicle, test drives, finance options, ordering and a faster delivery than expected. The collection day itself was very memorable and a great experience. Well done and thank you to Martin Pearce."
11/13/17,5,"Fantastic service, would definitely recommend Coopermini Teesside"
11/13/17,2,"I checked my wife's X5 into Coopers BMW on 18/10/17 to fix a problem with Tyre Pressure Monitor always showing on the iDrive. I learnt from the engineers that the rear tyres were not run flat tyres and that there was a damaged sensor, both probably contributing to the problem. I agreed to have the tyres changed to run flats and have a new sensor fited. I paid £494.77. When driving the car away my wife learnt that the Tyre Pressure Monitor came back up on the iDrive. She also lost several of the features on the iDrive, probably as a result of the engineers playing around with the settings on the iDrive. ie no sat nav, no weather reading etc. I phoned and complained that the problem had not been fixed but agreed to have a service done on the basis that these problems would be resolved at the time of doing the service. The service was arranged for 8/11/17. The service was done on 8/11/17 and I paid £375. On driving the car away, after approx 5 miles the Tyre Pressure Monitor came up on the iDrive again. Clearly, the fault had not been fixed. The weather indicator was also un-obtainable on the iDrive and I have subsequently learnt that this is due to the BMW server being down.The car has now been booked in for 2/3 days to have diagnostics undertaken on it to try to fix the problem. This is scheduled for 27 - 29th Nov. I understand that this is to be done under warranty. So far I have spent £869.77 on a problem that has not been fixed and will have been outstanding for approx 6 weeks. Not a good service!"
11/13/17,5,Had great service from East Kent Audi recently from both the service and parts departments. Really pleased with them and would recommend.
11/13/17,5,"Great customer service, no wait, no hassle, I would recommend to anyone"
11/13/17,5,"Really great service received!
Car was picked up at agreed time. Good communication and very pleased with service.
Would recommend"
11/13/17,5,Very efficient no problems
11/13/17,4,"Very Happy with the Service Provided, everything explained upfront, courtesy vehicle provided for the day, contacted when my vehicle ready, no surprises, would recommend the service plan, if available, that was offered to me when I purchased my vehicle."
11/13/17,2,"Polite disorganisation
Even if everyone was very polite and trying to be helpful, It took 6 phone calls to arrange a simple repair to a mirror.

The welcome, organisation etc was impeccable, however the repaired mirror cowling dropped off when I parked. I was able to click it back into place, but it was not exactly a well completed job."
11/13/17,4,"Excellent service, nursed my car home on Thursday with a burning clutch , thought my car would be off the road for a couple of days got it back same day, what service.
I can honestly say that CooperBMW at Boldon is the best in the North East in my experience, had Mercedes & Audi’s but Cooper offer excellent service every time."
11/13/17,5,Excellent customer service as ever. Always recommend this dealer to my friends. Will be buying from here again.
11/13/17,4,"Excellent service from Faith in the Customer Service Department and a new 530d courtesy car was provided for me. My car was attended to quickly and efficiently within the time agreed and handed back fully valeted so full marks there.
The downside is that I requested an i8 as a courtesy car because I want to test drive one before committing to buy and this seemed the ideal time to do so. The Service Department informed Sales in good time to arrange this but the Sales Department took no notice of the request. Regrettably it's not the first time this has happened."
11/13/17,4,"Handbrake adjustment done quick and efficient.
Was told on the phone the car would be cleaned unfortunately when I picked up no clean car. Shame."
11/13/17,5,A1 service from start to finish.
11/13/17,4,Regular Service
11/13/17,5,"First class service from Damien Buttler he was very knowledgeable and kept us informed regularly from time of order through to collection.
Highly recommend inchcape Shrewsbury"
11/13/17,5,"Whilst my car was being Mot'd, my wife and me were constantly checked for our comfort, and our every need was seen to be satisfied by Inchcape Staff. Most certainly, we would recommend Inchcape as a centre of excellence to anyone seeking our opinion!
Signed, John and Lynne Peters."
11/13/17,5,"Eddie at Swindon Audi was absolutely brilliant, and so was James who talked through the finance paperwork with me. Eddie is very friendly, talked through all of the options and helped me to find the perfect car. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!"
11/13/17,5,Excellent service thanks
11/13/17,5,"I live quite some distance away from Audi Tetbury, which could have been problematic, but you'd never have known.
From start to finish everyone I've dealt with and in particular, Kieren Bromham (Sales Executive), were 1st class, knew their products, were utterly professional and importantly personable.
During the process, I had an issue come up that, given the distance and the nature of the problem, was causing me some considerable stress.
However, Kieren and the management team above, handled it for me which was a major blessing.
Finally, at the handover, I was made to feel like the only customer there.
So a huge thank you to everyone involved in my purchase from start to finish. You all did an amazing job.
Best Regards,
Steve Rigby"
11/13/17,4,"Very accommodating and great customer service. Only comment would be that spending £466 on a service with a reputable company, I did expect my car to be valeted as I was with the previous service."
11/13/17,5,"Excellent service, minimal waiting time and good coffee while waiting!"
11/13/17,5,Fantastic service; really speedy; and a very helpful team in terms of advice and support for maintaining the vehicle. Brilliant!
11/13/17,5,"excellent service - car collected from works address and delivered back within the same day for annual service, service personal very friendly and polite, I would recommend them"
11/13/17,5,Good service as usual. Only minor gripe was that on a waiting appt it took nearer 2 hours rather than 1 but only minor point as was a Saturday.
11/13/17,5,First Class Service *****
11/13/17,5,"VW Stockport provided excellent customer service when our cars were recently taken in for their service.
The staff were well organised and adaptable responding to our needs on both occasions. They put the customer first and they are very professional. Would highly recommend this well organised set up which left us feeling satisfied and valued customers.

Thank you
Mr and Mrs C October 2017"
11/13/17,5,"Mercedes Liverpool is like an old friend where sometimes we do not see eye to eye and both of us can be a little araggant and complacent but then again there is a bond and a love between us. The bond has been established for more than quarter of a century, initially with Road Range and then Inchcape and has involved the purchase of more than 50 cars for personal and business purposes when I was a Director of Cammell Laird responsible for executive vehicles.

Sometimes, Mercedes has let the side down and in the past I have turned to BMW for solas but I keep bouncing back. The reason is quite simple, in that the quality of Mercedes Benz cars is unrivalled by any other cars that I have owned including BMW, Bentley, Aston Martin and many more. I know a little bit about quality as a Vice President of Fincantieri, the world leader in the build of beautiful cruise ships, mega yachts, offshore vessels and military combatants. So when I use the word ‘Quality’ I know what it means!!

With regard to customer care, I have found that generally, I am always looked after in a dilligent professional way and that any problems are resolved to mutual satisfaction. During my time in dealing with Mercedes Liverpool, sales, technical and management staff have come and gone, just as in any business, but the good news is that the ethos never changes and the attention to detail always improves.

My latest acquisition is an S500L and the techical content and styling is phenomenal. I have replaced a 3 year old S400L Hybrid so you would expect the engine design and vehicle performance to be similar but nothing could be further from the truth. The new electrified engine is fantastic and a technical wonder to behold.

So thank you Mercedes Benz for this new delivery, thank you Inchape for solving the problems and thank you to the management and staff including Martin Thompson, Sophie Davies, Darren Timoti, Jon-Paul Flannery and the back room technical staff for bringing the smile back to my face and a job well done.

The journey continues!!!

11/13/17,1,"Went into Audi Crawley and had the worst experience. Called to arrange looking at car and were completely uninterested and unorganised. No one had a clue what they were doing. They separate new and used car sales and won’t help each other. I was looking at buying a 2017 plate car and no new sales would help even though they probably could have talked me into buying a new car. Was just a mess and needs to be looked at. The receptionist had to take me on a test drive!! The receptionist was the only good thing about that place and she was lovely. This branch needs serious attention ASAP. The car I was looking at purchasing was advertised at a different mileage, all 4 rims were curbed and there was a mark on the rear bumper (where someone had clearly reversed into something). All round horrible experience and have since gone to different Audi dealership who are actually helping me and I am possibly purchasing a new car. Do not bother responding with 'please contact us so we can change your experience'. Generic responses are not what people are looking for."
11/13/17,4,"Adrian Hart, the salesperson who helped me find the car was excellent. Very informative, kept me up to date at all times and we concluded the deal for the car within a week.

Excellent service and a good guy to deal with.

I would recommend asking for Adrian."
11/12/17,5,"Brilliant service. Fitted our car in at short notice as it had developed a fault even though they were fully booked. Were able to diagnose the problem and as it was a fairly simple repair, do it the same day. Even washed the car too! Always extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. A pleasure to do business with."
11/12/17,1,"Very poor service,they are interested to do do sells,not looking after existing customers,even one star is too much to rate them"
11/12/17,1,"Thank you Inchcape Mercredes for wasting 3-4 hours of my Sunday afternoon. Having booked a test drive the previous day in an AMG GTS for Sunday afternoon I arrived at the dealership to be told that the car had been sold. While I appreciate these things happen why did the dealer not have the good manners to contact me and save me a 3 hour round journey.
I was allowed to see the car but not allowed to drive even though I was told the sale was subject to inspection as the deposit was taken over the phone.
On the upside I wouldn’t have bought the car because it was so badly presented, obviously hadn’t been washed and the drivers side footwell was full of mud. I’d expect better from a main dealer especially for a car costing near 90k!"
11/12/17,5,", top man couldn't of ask for better help
Would recommend 👍"
11/12/17,4,"My Car has just been in for an M.O.T. Overall a good experience. I have no complaints about the service front of house, and the M.O.T. check was videoed and sent to my mobile to see exactly how my tires and brake pads were checked, a nice touch. The only comment I have is the picture I saw while the technician was talking about my brake pads showed the brake servo not as far as I could see, the pads. It would help if the technician pointed a pen to the pads to show the wear, so there is no confusion about what the customer should be looking at."
11/11/17,5,Great Service
11/11/17,5,"I have always had 100% satisfaction with Copper BMW York.

Very accommodating polite staff at all times."
11/11/17,5,Great customer service! Thank you!
11/11/17,4,"Carried out a full service and I felt I was treated well. Claire Hart was very helpful and once it was realised the post service car clean hadn’t been done well, the car was immediately re cleaned properly."
11/11/17,5,"On the morning of collection of my 'new to me' Audi A6, the salesman noticed a dent in the bonnet that he, myself and several other members of the team at Tetbury Audi had failed to notice on previous inspections of the vehicle (or it had happened whilst being stored, awaiting collection). Unable to get it resolved in time, I took the car 'as was' on the premise that I could return at a time suitable for me for the corrective work to be carried out. I returned 2 weeks later - dent was repaired as promised and I was still treated as if I was a potential customer (rather than somebody who had already been relieved of a hefty wad of cash)."
11/11/17,5,"Clean and smart dealership with comfortable seating area. The service was carried out efficiently. Information from the garage was very good, including a video of the underside of the car emailed to me on the day. Very impressed."
11/11/17,5,"First time with a VW and the service beats all of the other German manufacturers I have had in the past. Always get top service from the team, thank you very much and I know where I am going in the future."
11/11/17,1,"I purchased a “Manufacturer approved” Toyota Yaris from INCHCAPE TOYOTA in Derby on 13 October 20117, and within three days I reported the problems with this car when driving it on motorway, which I could not possibly have found during a 10 minute Test Drive on city roads.
I returned the car back within a week and they had it for next two weeks, initially saying that there was a problem with suspension mountings. I asked to exchange the car under "" 30 Day Exchange Plan"" and was led to believe that they would honour this written agreement, but it could not be further from truth.
Then suddenly this week I was told that they had changed back 2 Continental Tyres with Budget Tyres and magically everything was OK. I was told to collect the car as there was now nothing wrong with it !!!
As soon as I drove it again on the motorway the problem was still there so I asked for exchange under "" 30 Day Exchange Plan"".
I am still within 30 days period and not satisfied with the car, but I have been told that "" 30 Day Exchange Plan"" does not apply because they decided that the car is OK.

It is TOTALLY UNFAIR that INCHCAPE can decide that there is nothing wrong with the car and you can forget about the written agreement of "" 30 Day Exchange Plan"".
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION does not seem to really matter in this written contract they give you when you buy a car from INCHCAPE.
I hope that anyone buying a car from INCHCAPE in future take note of my unfortunate experience about this wonderful "" 30 Day Exchange Plan "" as I have to just FORGET IT !!!"
11/11/17,3,"I was disappointed with the service we received.
When I booked I said we had a service plan, but was asked to bring paperwork as proof. On arrival I was questioned again and had to sign a form promising I would pay for the service if I couldn’t prove I had paid for a service plan.
On return to collect my car, I was asked to take a seat and then waited for 15 minutes. There were clearly lots of personnel in your garage but all were busy chatting either to each other on their phones. I had in my possession proof of payment of my service plan. When finally your representative arrived he slipped into the conversation there had been a mistake and I had indeed paid for my service plan.
Not the best reception I’ve received and frankly felt somewhat insulted when I’m spending a considerable amount of money with your company every month not to be trusted to pay a bill which I knew I didn’t even need to pay.
My suggestion would be to check your paperwork -given you had several week’s notice to do this before making your clients feel they were trying to get away without paying.
The actual service work and cleaning of car could not be faulted."
11/11/17,1,"Ending up waiting 3hrs for a wait in minor service. What’s the point of this wait in service if the wait is near 1/2 of my working day! Had my work laptop as WiFi was available, yet it wasn’t working. Ended up using my phone as a hotspot.

Found out I had a nail in a tyre which they sent me a video about. Didn’t mention the tyre when handing the car back to me and when asked about it, they said pressure is all fine but didn’t have tyre in stock to change anyway. Drove car Home, felt very wrong, only to find out the pressure on one tyre is 0psi! Didn’t even bother pump it up so I can drive home safely.

Service was free as I had a service plan. But wouldn’t pay for this sort of experience out of my own pocket."
11/10/17,5,Excellent service throughout! Thank you.
11/10/17,5,"Completed to my satisfaction.
Thank you!"
11/10/17,5,"If you want that feel good factor and a good job, treat your car to a Cooper BMW Service."
11/10/17,5,"Excellent customer service, it's really good to see a company that deliveries a high service all round from all members of their team!"
11/10/17,5,"My annual service and MOT was completely painless. Prepaid 3 years service and two complementary MOTs meant zero cost this time! Car in good nick after 7 years. Easy journey to the site, ample parking, courteous service and a short video to boot! The improvement on the old site is quite amazing."
11/10/17,5,As usual very efficient and friendly service with the minimum of hassle on my part. Excellent service.
11/10/17,1,"I purchased a Signature used car from Inchcape Southend. Advertised as good quality cars, I trusted the sales description of the car as I was unable to travel in person to view it. I was honestly told that it had a small area of dent on the boot but was otherwise in very nice condition. It was sold as having 21,335 miles on the clock. When it was delivered I was choked to find that it had in fact done 23,040 miles, it had lots of minor scuffs and scrapes to the paintwork, but worst of all, there was a long scratch on the passenger door as though the car had been ""keyed"" and touched up with wrong colour paint. Having received a generic ""tell us if you are unhappy with your purchase"" email from Southend manager, Bradley Lawrence, I informed him of my dismay at the condition of the bodywork + extra mileage. A week later and I am still waiting for a response."
11/10/17,5,My car was in for an MOT and the 3 year service. Excellent service from the friendly guys on the desk and impressed that the technician send me a video by text message pointing out the outside of the run flat front tyres were down to 3mm. Thank you
11/10/17,3,When I take my car to my local garage I hand him the keys and say speak to you later. Job done. When I take my car to inchcape it’s a whole rigermarole of front desk receptionist who then askes you to take a seat where you wait forever to be seen by someone with an iPad who then goes over exactly what you explained on the phone to them. 15-20 minutes later you hand them your keys. Unnecessary and frustrating experience!!
11/10/17,5,"Pain free experience, great service."
11/10/17,5,Great customer service. Very friendly and polite team
11/10/17,5,Always welcome at the site. Work completed on schedule and car given complimentary wash.
11/10/17,5,Excellent customer service with a timed appointment and the car was ready on time.It was fully valeted as well.The service dept were very helpful and are a credit to volkswagen macclesfield.I would recommend them without hesitation.
11/10/17,5,"The service and team were superb, got my Cooper S yesterday and it's brilliant! I would highly recommend the team at Cooper Thames Ditton MINI."
11/10/17,5,"I was delighted with the excellent response, when I required the faulty back light on my Aygo fixing quickly. I was given an appointment right away and while they were checking it out a member of staff gave me coffee. The light was fixed quickly and I was back home two hours after I had first contacted Inchcape Toyota."
11/10/17,3,"I was quoted an hour and 20 minutes for a first service and for the car to be washed.
I waited for an hour and 40 minutes before someone said they just had to get the keys for me. A further 20 minutes later after asking again how long I would be waiting, my car was ready.
I think this timeframe was unacceptable, especially as my daughter was left waiting for me to collect her from college, which I would have been able to do within the time initially quoted.
No coffee or explanation was given.
However, I do need to confirm that each staff member I spoke to was extremely pleasant."
11/10/17,5,"I waited two hours for my MOT as agreed by service, when I contacted them on the phone. Found Staff very pleasant and helpful.

I helped myself to tea/coffee, and received the car as expected two hours later , washed and vacuumed.

I would recommend this dealership"
11/10/17,5,Great service again by jack at inchcape Leicester giving us all the options without pressure always with a smile on his face. Will definitely go back
11/10/17,5,I received excellent service from Damien who brought the car to me for a test drive and was extremely helpful in organising the sale.
11/10/17,5,"I received excellent attention and was treated very courteous by all the staff at HA fox in York.. Will was very knowledgable and could not be more helpful.
I will certainly be buying another car from this dealership"
11/10/17,5,"Took my sport in for its first MOT. Booking in procedure and reminder was effortless and appreciated. The personal service,update and attention from all hunters staff was excellent. All staff were very professional and helpful. MOT and car valet completed earlier than expected and again to a high standard"
11/10/17,5,"staff very helpful, got a great deal"
11/10/17,5,"Service guys know me and my car and makes it feel like a personal service, even through a vast BMW dealership. Deliver my car back to me at home; always clean it; always ready on time."
11/10/17,5,Excellent service
11/10/17,5,They picked my car up and dropped it off at work so there was little disruption to me I find this service excellent
11/10/17,5,Great price servicing and happy helpful service team.
11/10/17,5,"I had a problem with vibration at certain speeds, typical of wheel balancing. Inchcape Loughborough fitted me in quickly and fixed the problem, and also sent me an inspection video of the underside of my car which was much appreciated. This is a first class company who have sold and serviced my cars now for many years"
11/10/17,5,This is my third mini from this particular team. That should say it all but just to make sure you understand....... The whole experience is a pleasure when parting with your money as it’s not just buying a car. From entering and being greeted at reception to any little requests with Darren in parts and their specialist ‘touch up’ man it was a joy. Shop with confidence that you will be treated with a smile that is genuine. Thank you.
11/10/17,5,"Excellent in every way, fast friendly and efficient."
11/10/17,5,"Superb service. Attentive, thorough, fast and up to date throughout. Would highly recommend."
11/10/17,5,"Booked in at Bilbrough Top for a Heldex transmission pump replacement.

11/10/17,5,brilliant from start to finish
11/10/17,5,Everyone was very courteous and they dealt with me and the service of my car in a very professional manner. I would definitely recommend this company.
11/9/17,5,Received by a confident and polite engineer who debriefed me after the check in a friendly and informed manner. The experience confirmed that MB is an efficient organisation.
11/9/17,5,Friendly efficient service
11/9/17,5,"Car had airbag replaced at Cooper BMW this week and I was impressed by the level of Customer Service that I received, my thanks to Steve Brand & team."
11/9/17,5,Excellent customer services from Natasha Olivia. Made me feel valued as a customer. Well done . The team is exceptional but Natasha is and has been outstanding on all the visits I have been with my Golf. Thanks you.
11/9/17,5,I Picked up my new GLA on Tuesday. The motorbility specialist Lisa could not have been more helpful. She was professional from start to finish. And so helpful in helping me make up my mind what colour and spec I needed. Thank you Lisa. Your a star
11/9/17,1,The desk staff were rude and unwelcoming. I walked up and said hi when I came to collect my car and one of them looked at me like I was speaking French and continued to just look at me. Her collage actually had to answer me as she just sat and stared.
11/9/17,5,Just moved to area recently so looked at Jaguar dealer nearby for servicing my car. Arrived just as they were opening and were immediately helpful. Booked car in and had quick drink of coffee before going off with my wife to explore the shops in the area. Rang to let us know that car had had MOT done and servicing finished and ready to collect. Went through everything on return and car was clean and ready to go. Very helpful and courteous response from all staff we encountered.
11/9/17,5,"Great service, highly recommend"
11/9/17,5,"Helpful staff when booking my car in, video sent of checks made, price of work as quoted, speedy service and comfortable waiting area."
11/9/17,5,Excellent service Adrian was superb really knew his stuff
11/9/17,5,Advisor really friendly and helpful
11/9/17,5,"Great service. Car collected and serviced, washed then delivered home all in one day. Superb!!!"
11/9/17,4,"Just a problem with timing. The whole job took more than an hour longer than expected. This was recognised by staff, without any complaint from me and a charge was waived in compensation.
It's not the first time that there has been a problem with timing. I would like to think this issue could be improved. Otherwise excellent service."
11/9/17,5,"Great service from start to finish kept informed every step of the way, was even sent a video of the health check being carried out.
Would recommend!"
11/9/17,5,Very good service
11/9/17,1,"Having spent a lot of money with Inchape vw over the past 15 years I am very disappointed with the service I received from Cheltenham VW .
I booked my golf in for a winter check and at the time agreed the car was dropped off. I was told that they were very busy and could I pick it up at 5pm .I asked the advisor to give me information regarding the Dash Camera that was advertised on one of the flyers that was on show in the service area .They seemed to have no idea what it was about and would make enquires and give me the information when I returned. I arrived to pick the car up at the said time, the adviser informed me they had not had time to get the information and would ring me with it .I am still waiting . Also part of the inducement of having the car checked for winter was having washed and valet this was not carried out. Having been a loyal customer of Vw for over 20years I am very disappointed with the service provided. I look forward to your response."
11/9/17,5,A great service from Neville and team at Cooper Cobham. A great exsperiance and look forward to the next.
11/9/17,5,"From booking the work to driving away with work all completr, very good service. Good updates during day."
11/9/17,5,"The story begins with a phone call to Inchcape, Mercedes Benz Nottingham, after having seen an SL63 AMG on PistonHeads. I was invited to view the car and did so the following day after a 45 mile drive to Nottingham, as these cars are quite rare, especially in the colours I prefer.
I was greeted by the new lady sales person, who had only been employed there for only one week, but I understood her inexperience and we made a list of the questions I needed to have answers to.
We were joined by the more experienced used car sales manager and collectively over the next 4 hours of explanations, demonstration a positive test drive, I bought the car. The used car sales manager is very knowledgeable and all the staff, are genial, personable and not at all pushy in their approach, to secure business.
Certain modifications to the car had to be completed at the dealership, so collection was delayed, but when my wife and I did return to collect, the car was immaculately presented, from under a black cover in an individual ""Hand-over Bay"" which was an experience to savour.
As with all used cars, there were a few discrepancies, so we returned with the car a few days later and the service we received was quite exemplary. I have been in the motor trade for 54 years and bought many cars, both new and used and at no time have so many staff, with so many different skills been on hand to ensure total completeness and customer satisfaction, from every level of management.
I am now on first name terms with 7 members of this successful team of experts, who appear to place excellence as their watch-word. I was offered a similar courtesy car, but preferred to wait and all was resolved before driving home later in the day.
The SL Class, is a comprehensive vehicle, so the company offer the tutorial services of a most knowledgeable member of their staff, to provide a buyer with hands-on practical tuition, which was very much appreciated.
This is my 5th Mercedes and I have no hesitation In recommending Inchcape, MB Nottingham, as: -

""Quality and service, are remembered long after price is forgotten!""

11/9/17,5,Everything was done promptly and in a friendly manner
11/9/17,5,"Bought a e92 M3 through the bmw group and only had it 2 months and noticed the oil level had gone down so asked the service dest at cooper Norwich if everything was ok , they got one of there technicians to go completely over the car and then assured me all was ok and running as it should be ... very polite and helpful and was looked after with tea and coffee while it was being checked.. they even washed it for me... excellent service"
11/9/17,5,First class service from everyone in the Service Department and Reception :-)
11/9/17,5,Always good to visit Mercedes of Oxford! I previously used a local garage (West London). I was let down by them many times and in the end switched manufacturer. When I found a car I liked in Oxford I thought I would also use them for services etc! That was about 3 years ago and I still make the journey and have never had an issue! Just how it should be in my opinion. I would happily recommend them!
11/9/17,5,"Excellent service , very nice warm staff, job done promptly and car washed when I collected"
11/9/17,5,"Just an MOT but painlessly arranged over the phone, collected from the house and returned perfectly valeted."
11/9/17,5,"I was kept up to date the whole time my car was in for the service, collected and delivered back on time, very friendly and helpful."
11/9/17,5,"Great customer service, looked after very well"
11/9/17,5,"I purchased my second hand Passat in March and had not yet had dealings with Inchape VW. I booked a service for this month and from the moment I set foot in the door, the staff were all helpful, friendly and attentive. A big plus was the offer of a taxi to & from town whilst service was carried out. When I collected the car, everything was explained fully. I also had a follow up call to check all was well. I will definitely use inchape again and seriously consider buying my next Passat from them!"
11/9/17,5,"I went to the Parts Dept to order a luggage compartment mat for my car. Calton was very helpful and phoned the following day to let me know that the part has come in. I went to pick it up and he fitted it in the boot of my car. I was also looking for a protective bumper mat and although VW make them, they don't make them for my car. I showed him the mat that I was going to buy and he said it was similar to the VW bumper protective mat and would do the job perfectly. The customer service that I received was second to none!"
11/9/17,5,excellent staff and service as always
11/9/17,5,l found the experience very relaxing and pleasant. All the staff were courteous kind and friendly.
11/9/17,3,"No car ready for me after I'd specified a time,courtesy car smelled of cigarettes and full of rubbish and to top it I'm called a woman in text to ask if my experience was good."
11/9/17,5,Great service. Jeremy on Customer Service is 1st Class and always has been. He will be a great addition to the team at Hunters.
11/8/17,5,Excellent experience with all concerned great communications. Special thanks to the people who cleaned it as it came back spotless!
11/8/17,5,"Very pleased with my purchase of a used Audi A3, both with the car and the process of buying it."
11/8/17,5,"I have used Cooper BMW in Sunderland on a number of occasions now and just recently - their service exceeds my expectations every single visit, from the minute I walk in the door, from being greeted by the receptionist, booked in at the Service desk, updated by the mechanics, to getting my car at the end of the visit and the work from the team who ensure it is perfectly clean when I get in it - every single interaction is spot on - a friendly bunch who really work hard and cohesively as a team to make your experience extra special - so much so they were one of the main reasons I went with BMW again when selecting my new vehicle last year."
11/8/17,2,"I booked the car in for MOT 8 weeks in advance and requested a new tyre which I knew would be required as the other three tyres had been replaced by the dealership at previous service. I arrived at the allotted time 9.10 and was told by the very pleasant service receptionist no service work was required, just the MOT and new tyre. I estimated 45 mins to 1 hour at the most (4 year old dealer serviced BMW should be able to pass easily). I sat down in the waiting area, had a very nice cup of coffee and read the newspaper - I was having such a good time I lost track of time and at 10.50 am went across the road to the third party tyre vendor to ask about a spare tyre for another vehicle. I saw my BMW parked in the third party tyre place and realised Cooper had driven it over there to get them to change the tyre. I returned to Cooper to ask them if my car was ready yet as it had been two hours. They said it needed the tyre changing and I then pointed out the car had been parked across the road at the third party tyre centre for twenty minutes. Cue disappearing Cooper guy to get my car (another 20 minute delay). There was no time to have the car valeted (usual compensating factor for the higher MOT cost) as I had been waiting 2 1/2 hours and had to go. Obviously my experience and the cost was worse than if I had taken the car myself to the tyre vendor (very excellent Ian Brown Tyres) and then had the health check, MOT and valet done by Coopers. I will know next time."
11/8/17,5,"Nice staff no pressure to buy, helpful after sales from Tim Barry, thanks 😉"
11/8/17,5,"Only one word for this company excellent.
Was kept well informed what was happening by a very helpful Alex"
11/8/17,5,prompt efficient service from all the staff
11/8/17,5,They prompted me that my MOT was due and arranged to pick the car up. Arrived on time and carried out the work quickly including cleaning and hoovering the car. Phone call to explain the work was friendly and helpful. Car delivered back earlier than they said. All very professiona.
11/8/17,5,"Excellent customer service, very friendly and made to feel very welcome, would recommend Lexus Derby"
11/8/17,5,"Very good service, kept me informed with all work involved. Had home collection witch was a bonus for me. Thank you"
11/8/17,5,"Fast and quality service provided.
Had an MOT check from 9:15 till 10:30."
11/8/17,5,"Very pleased with the Service on my car and the video showing what is happening underneath my car which gives me peace of mind.

11/8/17,5,"Great service from start to finish, kept informed at every stage of my service."
11/8/17,4,"I was professionally welcomed by the Reception staff whom quickly acted upon my request whilst offering me a drink. I was dealt with professionally and the staff were keen to ensure they understood what I required and listened carefully to what I had to say. My car was fixed, cleaned and handed back to me in less than the specified time. Happy with the service I received on this visit."
11/8/17,5,"I would recommend this branch; the team members are very personable and if you get a service plan, you can save some money. I’ve had 5 VWs over the years and they have all my history on file and I don’t have to go to the effort of remembering much to do with the cars. Go here and get on with life!"
11/8/17,5,Bought a second hand car from Inchcape and the overall service was superb. The salesman Piotr in particular was tremendous and gave me so much time and explained everything so clearly. He wasn't pushy and gave me time to decide on things a great guy who I would do business with again. A five star plus service.
11/8/17,5,"I visited Macclesfield Audi to have my Winter wheels fitted.
This is a brilliant idea for regular customers as the wheels that are not in use are stored by the dealer and changed free of charge including a health check on the car and a valet if required.
Top quality like the vehicles that are sold at this establishment."
11/8/17,5,"Would not go anywhere else,very helpful and friendly,could not be any better"
11/8/17,2,"salesman was great did his job well. The car had not been prepared well for sale,a door trim with and a trim around the gear stick with very bad scratches. Each wheel had 2/3 plastic wheel nut covers missing and one even didnt have a valve cap!! Not what you would exspect when the car had supposed to of had a 145 point check!!"
11/8/17,5,excellent service provided on the day. Nice people. Now let's hope the car works!!
11/8/17,3,"Chris Galvin was extremely helpful and my overall experience was positive ... which makes the dealership's petty-mindedness over things like petrol even more ridiculous! When someone takes ownership of an expensive Audi, their new pride and joy, the first thing they have to do is???? Enjoy a relaxed drive and enjoy the thrill
of something new and special, or head for a petrol station???? That reality check comes far too soon!
As for the car, very pleased. I think it'll be a keeper!!
Thanks again Chris!"
11/8/17,5,"As I have been a customer at Inchcape Volkswagen for the last five years I Knew I would get an excellent service on the purchase of another car and I did. The process was very straightforward and everything was explained and my questions answered satisfactorily. The salesperson I dealt with was very efficient, very friendly and very knowledgeable."
11/8/17,5,Efficient service.👍
11/8/17,5,"Colin Blekinsop on service reception is a credit to your company. Always very professional, most helpful, courteous and efficient in his dealings with customers.

Freelander Owner purchased from this Dealership February 2013."
11/8/17,5,"Excellent - From the moment I left the car for it's service to when I collected, good communication throughout the day from all members of staff.
2. Thank you for your reply Inchcape - You have gone all American with your ""reach out"" which is a bit unnecessary, however a positive experience by me that day - Well done!"
11/8/17,5,"I have just traded in my twelve year old Corolla under the scrappage scheme for a new Auris Hybrid Touring Sports, which is an amazing car. The Japanese competition (I looked at Honda and Mazda) was very hot, but in the end I went for the technology of the future (hybrid) and in the certain knowledge that I would have the very best after sales service. All the staff, the sales team (Jagpreet in this case), the welcome staff at the counter, the engineers working behind the scenes and liaison staff are all efficient, polite and friendly. They are almost like family!"
11/7/17,1,"Treated us like idiots. We told them what we wanted to spend monthly and what we would be happy to deposit. They then ignored all of that and ended up trying to give us (against all FCA rules) financial advice; even told us we'd be better off putting the bulk of our deposit in an ISA at 2.5% (when was the last time you saw an ISA at 2.5% that would allow a £15k deposit???). Then spent 15 minutes trying to explain depreciation to a certified accountant.
Toilets were also a state with urine on the floor and excrement on the seat.
To cap it off, went to pick up the car from the service and their 'health check' failed to note a bloody big nail in my front tyre (that I know was there from two days before the service visit).
Manager was very apologetic for our experience, and I wanted the deposit we'd paid to be refunded. 5 days later, we have still been getting phone calls and no refund yet.
Seems the garage are totally hopeless.
On the plus side, the salesman was sound, just let down by his colleagues."
11/7/17,5,"The service I received from Mini Cooper Tonbridge was out standing.
In Particular Clare, who is an absolute asset to the dealership .
Both Clare and the dealership exceeded my expectations of brilliant service . They offered a totally professional service and went out their way to deliver a great experience .i would strongly recommend if buying a mini this is the place you need to go too
Clare passion and energy and commitment to deliver our standing service was amazing.
Customer for life"
11/7/17,5,Staff at Inchcape Bury are helpful and a lot more professional than the VW call centre which customers are routed to when booking a service.
11/7/17,5,"Hunters (Kings Lynn) were superb, they were very efficient and sorted all the problems out that I had, keeped me informed all the way"
11/7/17,5,"I got my 2 year service and used vw courtesy car (polo). They provided insurance but had £1000 excess or option to pay £15 bringing excess down to £50 which I took for peace of mind. I received an email with details of service with video going round car showing its in good condition. I got advise on tyres, brake pad, etc and when air con service due. I received a call to say it was finished early and ready to collect when convenient. I went to pick car up at 5pm and slight wait as busy. When I got in my car a token vw gift was waiting for me and I thought this was a nice unexpected surprise. Good work VW staff!"
11/7/17,5,"excellent customer service, work carried out on my car was second to none, will always use Twickenham volkswagon as long as I own a vw."
11/7/17,5,Excellent customer service. Many thanks for looking after me and my car.
11/7/17,1,"Let me share my experience of Coopers of Chelmsford with you in the hope that I can make you aware of what to expect when purchasing your new BMW from Coopers and the level of after sales care you will not get once they have sold you a car!!!
I write this review as a certified ISO Systems auditor,
Back in April I had my car booked in for a recall to have the EGR unit replaced. I travelled the 20 miles from where I live to the dealership and arrived at 08:00 as agreed.
I went in to the service reception to book my car in only to be told in a very unapologetic manner that they did not have the part and I would have to rebook the car in at a later date. I politely expressed my dissatisfaction and ask them to inform me when the part arrived and it was finally fitted in June.
My next experience was when I booked my car in for its first service in September. I had booked the car in at 08:15 for a while you wait service. On the day prior to the service I was called by the service department saying that they could see I had my car booked for a while you wait service but they did not have the details of the time that I was due in. I told them the car was booked in for 08:15 and was assertive that was the time that I wanted the car serviced and had no further problem on the day.
While I was having my car serviced despite the car only just covered 4000 miles my 2 door 1 series BMW was on the small side for my needs and had a chat with a salesman about the possibility of changing my car for an X1. The salesman checked through the list of stock cars and unfortunately there was not one that matched my wish list and the salesman being keen to make a sale asked what my budget was with a view to match a car to my needs.
A car was found a 220 M Gran Tourer Xdrive in blue and we that was the car for me. I went home and read the reviews on the car and decided that based on the reviews the M suspension would be too firm as I have a neck injury.
I emailed the salesman to ask him to look at finding me a car without the M suspension or a luxury version of the car and did not receive a repyl. I called the salesman a few days later to discuss the suspension issue and he told me my car was now in stock and invited me to come along to the dealership and test drive a car with the M suspension.
Having driven the car I agreed that the M suspension was not too bad but that I wanted a car without the M spec suspension. I also viewed the car that had been brought in from another branch for me and did not like the blue which reminded me of a mid 80’s Ford.
To the salesman’s credit he said changing the vehicle for another would be no problem and we agreed on a metallic grey car which I was told did not have the M spec suspension. Once I was home I read through the spec of the car only to find that I had been misled and the car did in fact have the M spec suspension.
I contacted the salesman and her wriggled around saying that this was not the firm suspension that had been reviewed in the motoring magazines and that there were a number of firmer levels of suspension above the M spec suspension. I pointed out that none of these levels of suspension were an option in the brochure so I will leave you to make your own opinion on whether what I was being told was fact or fiction. To compensate for the M spec suspension the deal I had agreed on was renegotiated and I reluctantly accepted the M spec suspension.
Despite being told that the car had been registered to me when it came to getting the car ready on the date I wanted it I was told that I needed to produce my insurance certificate to get the car registered. Unfortunately I could not get my documents to the dealership in time and so this delayed me picking up my new vehicle.
This was very annoying as I needed the new vehicle to go on holiday for a few days and the dealership had already taken in my part exchange vehicles. Again to the salesman’s credit he provided me with a courtesy car for my 4 day holiday and I arranged to pick up my new car on the Friday and gave the salesman my new mobile phone number as he said he wanted to keep in contact with me to give me updates on picking up my new car.
Thursday came and I had not heard anything from the salesman so I thought I would give him a call to finalise the Friday pick up. When I called he told me we were already for a Saturday pick up as agreed. This was not what I had agreed as I knew that I would be working all day on the Saturday. I was quite firm that I wanted to pick up the car on the Friday and I eventually got the Salesman to agree on the Friday pick up.
When I arrived at the dealership the car was still in the valeting bay and we completed the paper work while the car was being finished! We went out to the car and I identified what I thought was a scratch but it was just a piece of adhesive which had not been cleaned off and it was immediately dealt with. The inner sills of the car had not been dried off and had water laying in them and there were dusty footprints in the passenger side foot well. I did not bring this to the attention of the salesman as I just wanted to pick up my car and get out of the dealership.
I was due a refund of around £6000 on my part exchange vehicles. I offered both my bank and credit cards for the refund as the deposit part of the refund was due to be refunded to my credit card and was told that I would receive this money by bank transfer within a few days! The middle of the following week passed and the money was not in my account. On the Friday I emailed the dealership only to receive a reply that I had to fill in a form for the refund. I filled in the form and was told I would receive the refund by the middle of the following week.
The part of the refund which was to paid in to my account was paid in by the promised time but the deposit refund still remained outstanding. I chased this up, the dealership then told me that they now needed my credit card number to carry out my deposit refund which I gave them. They then again charged my credit card with the deposit charge. Which they then corrected and credited the full amount to my card.
During the latter stages of this saga I twice complained by email to the Head of Business Stewart Hicks. To which I received a short voicemail message acknowledging the poor standard of service I had received from Coopers of Chelmsford and two short replies which side stepped my questions and did not give me the information that I had requested.
The buck certainly stops with Stewart as he will not give you his line managers email details so that you can escalate your complaint to someone who may have a clue of what customer satisfaction means
I hope this review will help you make an informed decision on whether this is the level of customer satisfaction you would expect from a premium brand dealership?"
11/7/17,5,Very professional from all member of staff
11/7/17,5,"GREAT SERVICE ON MY LEXUS, THANKS."
11/7/17,5,Really happy with the friendly and superb service received at Southend Inchcape.highly recommended.
11/7/17,5,Really great service & helpful staff
11/7/17,5,very good everything done to my satisfaction
11/7/17,5,I took my car into Yeovil Audi after I sustained damage to my front bumper. The service and attention were excellent. I was visiting my brother at the time and wanted the car repaired before I travelled back home to Mottram. I took it in on the Monday afternoon and Mr Justin Moore of Yeovil Audi attended to everything for me. He was extremely helpfull and professional and he rang me on the Thursday morning to say my car was ready for collection. I shouldn’t think I could better service like that anywhere!
11/7/17,5,"Very helpful, and honest. Not pushy at all! Very happy with the service and hospitality"
11/7/17,5,Excellent service as ever especially from Colin on service reception. He never can do enough to help and exceeds expectations. I have used the garage for years for both my RR Vogue and my wife’s Evoque. Excellent.
11/7/17,5,Great first visit for the Servicing of my car
11/7/17,5,Fantastic service as always from VW and the staff especially Lisa Barclay in the Service department. Also received the data plug so am now using the My VW app
11/7/17,5,Excellent customer service where you are always given a warm welcome and and a full explanation of any work undertaken is provided.
11/7/17,1,"I have a 2016 Landrover rangerover. The screen on the dash board has started to crack from the bottom upwards and increase in size over the last few months.

Yesterday my vehicle was in Hunters Preston for a full day, to have the screen replaced under the manufactures warranty.

To my shock Hunters have stated it is not covered under warranty and require Two hundred pound to replace this.

I am also disgusted in the fact that Hunters have placed the blame on me, stating pressure has been place on the screen causing the crack which clearly is not the case. I clean my vehicle personally, so I know it is not been caused by a third party damage.

I am totally let down by Hunters and Landrover too. I have spent nearly one hundred thousand pound on a vehicle with a manufacturing defect, to be told I have to pay a further two hundred pound. It is not the amount that is frustrating, it's the principle and the way I have been treated and made out to be a liar.

I know you can produced these screens for around twenty pound, yet you are willing to loose custom and trust in your brand over this!!

I will take this further !!"
11/7/17,5,Staff werr brilliant. Very pleasant and friendly .
11/7/17,5,Great dealership...excellent showroom ..helpful and friendly staff.
11/7/17,5,Excellent service from start to finish...one slight niggle that is not enough to warrant a 4* rather than a 5* rating...the car was valeted inside and out as part of the service visit....but you forgot to clean the inside of the boot area !
11/7/17,5,"Excellent service from Inchcape once again with the annual checkup for my VW Golf. Comprehensive reporting and convenient service plan are the highlights. Good personal service and pleasant, knowledgeable staff are a bonus."
11/7/17,5,Thoroughly enjoyable experience buying a thoroughly nice car
11/7/17,5,Very friendly and approachable. Clear explanation of the details we needed to know. We were dealt with professionally and felt that all our queries were answered effectively.
11/7/17,5,"Fantastic customer service.
Very warm team and easy to talk to. They helped me find the right car within my price range. I bought my two Q7’s from Audi Maidstone and Samantha was very helpful. I will definitely be going back."
11/7/17,5,"Very friendly bunch, always a good start, i lease my car and the service was great, no issues and always do what they say and explain what they have done, supported by simple documentation."
11/7/17,5,Adrian was great to deal with and love the car
11/7/17,5,Excellent as always. Well attended to and full trust in the Malton team.
11/7/17,5,"Sue, in customer service, was excellent. Can not recommend highly enough.
Thanks"
11/7/17,2,"We love our Mini-but the after sales service is not up to scratch. Prior to the service in November, my car had a factory fault which caused the air con pipe to slowly leak into the passenger footwell. The car was take in for the repair and insurance paid for damage to personal belongings. Yay..however I discovered some six weeks later my credit card had been charge for the addtional insurance cover for the loan car. Despite attempts to contact the team no response has been given. A September health check gave a warning on the brake padS but the service in November gave no warning and indicated the depth was more than the September health check despite driving an additional 3000 MILES. We are confused and disappointed."
11/7/17,5,"Seamless, punctual, friendly"
11/7/17,5,Excellent service.
11/7/17,5,"A first class experience.

It was everything I expect from a premium brand. No complaints at all and the coffee was excellent!"
11/7/17,5,"Had my x5 mot carried out at Cooper Croydon,I received a very professional and organised service from arrival they knew my name and allocared a parking space. The car was checked over and I received a email and video of additional items found during the free health check whilst enjoying a coffee and working with the free wifi. The car was completed and washed and vacummed and ready on time. I asked for some information regarding I vehicles and the diagnostic team came out and answered all my questions. Keep up the good work. Would definantly recommend"
11/7/17,5,"Dealt with the issue speedily and professionally. Advised what needed to be done and completed the work in a timely manner.
Can't fault the service from Nottingham Inchcape. Had my car from them and would not go anywhere else for Mercedes."
11/7/17,5,"Very good service, friendly and explained what was going to be done to my car.
all staff were helpful and the show room was very clean and welcoming."
11/7/17,1,"I had waited over a month to have my airbag recall changed, upon arrival I was told it would take about an hour, I had already accepted a loan car as we had another appointment to attend straight after dropping the car off at 8.15am. The loan car I was given was a 17 plate 1 series which was covered in dents and scratches, the drivers side door was covered in ash and was of a dirty standard inside with ash on the steering column and dash, what can only be described as coffee splashes over the plastic interior and left with an empty tank, and the smell of stale cigarettes.! I proceeded to call twice to see if my car was ready and each time was told it wasn’t or the person whom was dealing with my car was with a customer or not answering there phone. Eventually I was able to collect my car at about 4.30 which I was told would be complimentary cleaned... ( no it wasn’t but was cleaner than my loan car) upon leaving and reaching home I was then email an inspection of my car where the mechanic Constantine commented “ you must appreciate in my opinion it could be driven more carefully” ! I found this to be the last insult after the vehicle I was provided with. So as for exceptional experience.. I’d say it definetly left me thinking would I want to come back to or even purchase a car from you."
11/6/17,5,Very helpful and efficient.
11/6/17,5,No issues did exactly what it said on the can.
11/6/17,3,"Called in to the parts department, have to say. Very helpful and knowledgeable"
11/6/17,5,"FAO The General Manager.
This is to congratulate you and your staff for the first class service received when I visited Inchcape VW Bolton last Friday for work to be done on my VW Touareg.
As soon as I opened the door to the showroom I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman who took me to the service department where I was booked in and introduced to the technician who would be working on my car. He came out for a short drive where I explained the problem I was having with the parking brake He was very knowledgeable and polite the whole time we were together.
When we returned to the showroom the lady who booked me in took me outside to the courtesy car explaining I would receive a phone call when my car was ready.
Just after lunch I received the call and told the car was ready for collection and what work had been carried out.
When I returned to the showroom the same lady went through the work undertaken again and brought my car round to the main entrance.
When I dropped the car off earlier in the day it was filthy on the outside and not very clean inside. It was returned to me in showroom condition.
Will you please personally congratulate and thank those involved.
Regards.
Mike Ainscough"
11/6/17,5,The team were so friendly and very helpful! I would definitely recommend them to anyone!
11/6/17,5,Excellent service and reliability. Amy was superb with her communication throughout the process and extremely friendly.
11/6/17,5,"Had my winter tyres fitted with no problems.

Cooper Durham is the best BMW dealer in the area."
11/6/17,5,Having arrived before they opened I was invited in for a free coffee. The service memeber of staff fired up his computer and booked me in 20 mins before they opened so that I could get away. The best service I have ever had at Coopers.
11/6/17,5,"Overall excellent experience and service, however one little complaint was that the staff on setting up service plan took my credit card away from view into the office which I didn't agree with or think was suitable.
Got a receipt for the new tyres I had fitted on the day, but no receipt for the service plan I paid for."
11/6/17,1,"Service staff extremely rude. No acknowledgement upon arrival.
Failed to provide a receipt for the service.
Failed to provide the paperwork for the service.
Bad experience."

11/6/17,1,"It’s very difficult to write an objective review about a dealership when the product they sell on behalf of the manufacturer falls so far short of expectations. And quite honestly as a customer of the business I would expect them to point out to Land Rover that it’s not an unreasonable expectation of the client that a £36000 Car would be able to see out its 4 year PCP deal from new without breaking down (again) and that despite the main dealer service throughout an engine fault at 3 years 6 months would quite reasonably be seen as a design fault.

As the lady on the service reception pointed out “it’s under a lot of pressure”. Is it really? Quick, phone the design team and tell them, the part they sourced from the cheapest supplier is not fit for purpose. I expect that her role is one of managing expectations for customers rather than a bringer of glad tidings.

Needless to say the next order they were expecting me to make will not be happening here.

For all this review I don’t expect anyone at the dealership or manufacturer to bother reading it"
11/6/17,4,"Very efficient, Carried out work quickly while I waited+ cleaned and carried out a health check ."
11/6/17,5,Really happy with the service this weekend. I booked a slot at the weekend as this was most convenient for me. The dealership serviced and valeted my wife’s car and I had it back in exactly 2 hours (whilst I waited) as they had promised. Thank you.
11/6/17,5,I received an excellent service from Mercedes Garage in kidlington from start to finish I think the staff are always very friendly and helpful.
11/6/17,5,Service could not have been better! Very happy.
11/6/17,5,"Really happy with my service, went above and beyond to keep me happy. Would recommend to anyone."
11/6/17,1,I received really bad customer service! Rude and unhelpful! They were inconsiderate that i had a new born with me and the communication was disgusting! I found that they didnt care that i was waiting around for almost 5hrs!
11/6/17,5,"Could not fault the excellent service we received at Lexus Derby, nothing was too much trouble and all the staff went out of their way to be helpful. I would have no reservations in recommending the company to anyone."
11/6/17,3,I cannot fault my car service but trying to get a cup of coffee after 2 attempts I gave up and said know more in case it got heated.
11/6/17,5,Excellent customer service - can't fault it. I'd been let down by another Volkswagen dealership and Inchcape Swindon were brilliant - from the booking to the communication on the day. Would recommend to all.
11/6/17,5,Excellent service from the staff
11/6/17,5,Julian at Maidstone Audi was fab. He didnt stop searching until he found us a car in our price range. He replied to emails straight away and really did his best to ensure an all round great experience. Will always go back.
11/6/17,5,"Helpful, efficient and very friendly experience."
11/6/17,5,Very friendly staff and work carried out in a very professional way.
11/6/17,2,"It's a long story!!
One of the issues was I book an appointment to take a car for a test drive when I got there the salesman couldn't find the car
Turned out a lady just passing by had taken the car for a test drive and wanted the car!
I'd driven all round 2hrs drive for nothing
I was told there was a car the same I could buy so I agreed this was not true!
Lots more issues after I agreed to buy the car it would take to long to list!!!!"
11/6/17,5,I have used Lexus Guildford regularly for servicing and car purchases for over seven years and have always found their service at point of sale and for aftercare to be excellent. I would recommend them most highly to anyone considering buying or servicing a Lexus car.
11/6/17,5,GOOD SERVICE AND FAST DELIVERY ON GETTING PARTS
11/5/17,2,"Used to provide good service but since emissions scandal have found them more evasive, and less customer focused. Had problems with my car since both 'fixes' (1st fix didn't work despite assurances from VW that no impact on MPG, performance etc. so had to have 2nd fix, car still not back to pre-fix state, and have since had DPF replaced). Have contacted them direct and by email to address some queries, and get documentation for work done, but no response 1+ month on."
11/4/17,5,"We bought our first Mercedes, C-class coupe on 14 February 2007, it has been wonderful ever since, so we have kept it, after buying SLK in April 2016.

The whole Mercedes experience at MB North Wales has been really great. In 2007, sales executive, Mark, found us the ideal, nearly new, car and it was brought from Southport for a free, no-obligation, test drive. Likewise the SLK was freely brought from Derby.

ALL the staff are most excellent, the Dealership premises and service are superb, the coffee is fine too - buying Mercedes was one of the best things we have done. Could not be happier, and if cars are MB serviced Mobilo offers 30 (YES, THIRTY) year, free rescue and recovery - rarely needed in our experience, but when the SLK roof got stuck, once, Mobilo paid for a 25 mile taxi home and flat bed recovery."
11/4/17,5,"Myself and my partner spoke to a gentleman called Peter Smith, he was very helpful from the moment we walked in to Cooper BMW. He went through different options with us finding us the right the one that benefited us. I couldn’t fault the correspondence he gave us by keeping us updated about the car we had chosen. I would highly recommed speaking to him to help find the right car for you. Thank you."
11/1/17,5,"Even though inchcape are not my local VW dealer it was well worth the extra mileage to deal with them. Josh sorted me out with a really good deal and was upfront about everything, would definitely go back again."
11/1/17,2,"Hi,
To start this off, I was at the dealership just to get a feel of the new 3 series as I was looking to purchase a nearly new one for cash in about a months time from when this happened as I knew it would be hard to get finance at 0 apr (religious reasons). As I was there, I was approached by the branch manager and he told me there was a special 0 apr on the EXACT same model I wanted, the 320d m sport. I mentioned that I was young and highly unlikely I'd be accepted for finance but he said don't worry, and introduced me to one of his advisors.
Going through the colours and specs I wanted, none were available so I settled for random colours they had available in stock. I was excited and I was provisionally accepted for finance on a Saturday and they went forward with it. I signed the papers etc.. and paid my deposit. Monday morning, I get a text saying my finance was declined (HUGE IMPACT ON MY CREDIT). They told me that I should increase my deposit, which I had already offered in the beginning and they tried it again and got declined again. (Ps. I had already mentioned I don't have anyone to be my guarantor as my family lives abroad.) After all this, I wanted my deposit back right? as the advisor said there's nothing else he can do. a week after I realized my deposit still hasn't come back so I messaged the advisor and he said he thought itd been refunded and I said it hasn't, he said he'll sort it out. A week after still no deposit and I called him over and over with no reply. Another week passed and I called him and he said he thought it was sorted. anyways long story short, it took a whole 6 weeks for my deposit to be returned, now I have a rubbish credit score over something I didn't want in the first place. I told him ill just wait until theres a good nearly new car offer but he insisted it would work because the company was desperate to meet their September sales.
I still carry the disappointment until this day, this all happened from 22/09-30-09..
thanks for reading"
11/1/17,5,"Recently picked up a new Audi Q7 from Cheshire oaks Audi assisted by Mr. Nathan Bird, From start to finish i can honestly say it was a very enjoyable experience and frequently updated on delivery, I will be sticking with Audi and Audi Cheshire oaks in the future.

11/1/17,1,"my purchase of a beetle from the twickenham branch failed to materialise through no fault of the dealer !
however trying to get back my 3,500 deposit is like drawing teeth !! i am still awaiting the refund some 14 days later !! every time i call the lady who does this is not there.

I have now called my card provider and reported them.

beware of giving a deposit to this company !! you have been warned !!"
10/30/17,1,"I purchased a new Yaris hybrid in late September and it was agreed that a second parcel shelf would be fitted. To date I am still waiting for the part to arrive. I have telephoned Inchcape a number of times and have been promised a call back to keep me informed which they have continually failed to do.
The after sales service is appalling and I would never recommend this dealership. If this is the way Toyota trains its staff to behave then any good reputation it has will soon disappear, however, if it is an Inchcape problem I wonder how much longer it will last as a Toyota dealership."
10/30/17,5,"I bought my car from the Loughborough dealership and the customer service was exceptional, so much so we ended up buying two cars!
Hardip the salesperson who showed us around was very helpful, calm and very attentive.
As I had not driven an automatic before he took me on a test drive and made me feel at ease, I don't think I have ever enjoyed driving a car so much.
We had to collect the two cars the following week and all the necessary paperwork was ready for us at the stated time. Hardip also took time to set up our Mercedes Me apps. The extra special touch was the presents for our children which we were not expecting at all.

I did, however, a few months later have an issue with the ipod connection for which I did have to take my car in, this was also resolved in a fast and efficient manner and i have not had any further issues with it. I have to give a special mention to the receptionists who were very friendly.
I can safely say Mercedes and Mercedes in Loughborough especially, have got two customer's for life."
10/29/17,3,"A very poor buying experience. They got my address wrong on the paperwork and as a result the DVLA posted my V5 to the wrong address and this prevented me from putting my private registration foe a week and even after telling BMW of the address error more paperwork arrived at the other address days later. no one returned phone calls in particular the sales manager. conflicting reasons being given as excuses for not calling me back. in short I felt that as I paid cash for my car after that I wasn't important any longer, on the day of collection (a week after the purchase) the car had a scratch that wasn't on the car when I purchased it, I pointed this out to the salesman who did the hand over and to his credit told me that it would be sorted and they would collect the car from me, I heard nothing from them nearly a week later so rang to see what was happening and surprise surprise no one knew anything about this.,they did collect the car and repainted the area to my satisfaction.
Iv always had Jaguar, maybe I should have stuck with them. I expected more from a main BMW dealership"
10/29/17,1,"Visited Inchcape Wirral and ordered what was advertised as a VW High Up .When I received my insurance certificate , 2 weeks later , it was in fact a lower spec . and priced Move Up , would not admit to their mistake , and held onto my deposit for over 3 weeks .To save any further embarassment I will not name the salesman as he has been mentioned in a previous review ! Complete amateurs , AVOID ."
10/28/17,5,"I recently purchased my third Jaguar from HA Fox, first one from Leeds and the second and third from Preston. Each time I have I have been very impressed with the courtesy and professionalism of HA Fox and their staff. Gareth Moyle dealt with my most recent purchase and went above and beyond to meet my requirements even to supplying Jaguar rubber mats because he heard my wife and I discussing the Grand childrens Saturday football mess ! Very impressive attitude to please.
Thank you Gareth and HA Fox."
10/27/17,5,I first went there to acompany my daughter who bought a car there and was attended by James Yeoman. Later on I went and bought a car there and was also attended by James. The service provided in all the process was impecable and not only by James but anybody who was around too and some of the administrative staff
10/27/17,1,"I visited Inchcape Wirral to get the ball rolling for a replacement Personal lease car for my daughter. The New Business manager could not see me and it was suggested that I see one of the sales team (Steve) I was shown to his desk where I was greeted with complete indifference, he was slumped in his chair with his head resting on his hand, he showed no enthusiasm at all for my enquiry and said that all the information I needed was in the email I received a few days earlier. to say he appeared bored with our conversation would be an understatement. If that is the standard of the sales team I will not return for any new car requirements. Throughout my family we own some 7 VWs from a lowly MK2 Golf to a VW camper. The previous Business manager Tony Burns was everything this guy was not, Helpful, Courteous and personable.
As a result of the experience at Inchcape Wirral I contacted Inchcape Chester and from quote to agreement to buy took two days the Business Manger Christopher Sault was an example of good practice he returned my calls and we had quotes within the promised 30mins timescale.
Your Wirral sales team could do with a lesson in good practice and manners"
10/26/17,5,"Excellent service from Lexus Guildford. I have no complaint's. The sales person (Malcolm Taylor) was so helpful.
I have always found Lexus, as a car dealership, look after you!"
10/25/17,3,"This is chicken and egg, whose fault is this? If Audi introduce electronic service records then surely the dealers ought to know how to manage customers around them? Is it acceptable that a (low mileage, 3.5k p.a.) car should be called in for a service, MOT, brake fluid change, Quattro oil change on fours separate occasions within 4 months? And then get the electronic service recording wrong. The service lady on my last visit was very pleasant and very helpful, but that is small beer in the grand scheme of things. 3 stars is generous."
10/24/17,2,"After a long day at work I went to collect my car which had been in the garage for the best part of 9 hours. A chap drove the car around the front for me which was great, it hadn't been washed (which they make a big deal of telling me when I book it in) not great. Then I drove my car less than 30 seconds down the road and noticed the engine light was on! I turned around and went back to the garage and told the staff and in particular the guy who drove it - who says he never noticed. Not one person apologised for the inconvenience this had caused me which I feel is totally unacceptable. I won't be using this garage ever again as this is not the first bad experience I have had with them so my own fault I suppose."
10/24/17,1,"Inchcape Volkswagen Romford has cost me £2500.00 for a new Tiguan that I brought only to find out had paint Defects over car I tried for weeks to sort out Being told had to have boot repainted and if Other marks do not come out will have to have painted too which I was not accepting to be painted as a brand-new car I reported this to the finance company and the dealership and the finance company as well as Volkswagen dealership and Volkswagen customer services then decided to come out with this tolerance policy and to refer to the manual handbook that the dealership have they never showed Me and
There was nothing on my order form about his tolerance policy for Volkswagen to replace Vehicle or refund a customer there must be quite a few marks and must be 180 MM each mark please they are saying they do not have to rectify the problems due to the tolerance so I have lost My deposit and I’ve had to pay them more money just to walk away without the car as it’s been a complete nightmare with this dealership and how I’ve been treated to all potential customers please ask to see the tolerance handbook and check your car over I believe that a brand-new vehicle should be 99% perfect and the vehicles or not I want want anyone to lose any money like I have I will never buy Volkswagen ever again I’m just glad it’s over now don’t have to deal with that dealership they don’t care about customers just taking your money when there problems out comes books Or whatever they can use to get out of it i’d like to give them no stars but Google won’t allow me Once again please stay away from inchcape Volkswagen Romford"
10/24/17,4,"Courteous as always.Service done while I waited.nice people.
ps liked the video!"
10/23/17,1,"My boyfriends BMW 1 series went through a puddle. Caused the engine to cut out. We have taken the car to cooper BMW in Chelmsford. Thinking the main dealership would be the best place to which get the car fixed.

After 2 weeks and £1200 down we thought fantastic we have our car back. But no 45 minutes into driving the vehicle the engine seizes on the Motorway on a live lane.
We then contacted cooper bmw Chelmsford the next day due to opening times.
Who failed to investigate the damage throughly. Tried to charge us to strip the engine even though it comes under the 30 day guarantee. When we collected the car it was certified fit for purpose.
Since then we have contacted BMW and they have failed to accept any responsibility and surmised that this has been caused by the previous puddle damage. Without clear and concise evidence and are refusing to refund any money as this would be classed as an admission of poor trademanship.
Because of this I will be getting legal advice talking with the obusman and other companies."
10/23/17,5,Easy. Quick. Painless. Great service.
10/21/17,5,"Friendly professional service. Made welcome by everyone, everything explained in simple terms, no hidden extras, and I will certainly be returning."
10/21/17,5,"Great experience .Always greeted with a smile.Which is why i always opt for a Toyota .
Reliable service can't fault it."

Should have had another Mercedes"

10/20/17,5,Did everything expected
10/20/17,1,"I am writing this on behalf of my dad as he has had an unsatisfactory experience at Inchcape. He bought a 64 plate Mk7 Golf from Bury Inchcape and has had problems with water in the boot and now a water leak through the speaker which is making the footwells full of water. They fixed the boot leak under warranty but now refuse to fix leak as it is 3 months out of warranty. Sean Matthews spoke to the manager and said they could give him a 50% discount for fixing the problem which would still result in him paying £250. He found this totally unacceptable and unreasonable. As a car should not be having these issues after such a short amount of time. After doing research online it is apparant that these leaks are a manufacturers fault, with many other VW owners, experiencing the very same problem.The whole experience has caused him inconvience and stress and in future would reconsider buying a VW car."
10/19/17,3,"I HAVE ALREADY REVIEWED ONCE AND AGAIN I SAY THE SERVICE PART WAS FINE BUT MY DOOR PANEL WAS DAMAGED BY THE CLEANER AND NOBODY HAS BEEN IN TOUCH TO SORT IT OUT.ALSO THE REPAIIR TO THE DOOR UPHOLSTERY WAS ON HINDSIGHT SHOODY,A BIT OF FILLER AFTER WAITING SO LONG.YOUR STANDARDS ARE SLIPPING?WHEN WILL YOU CONTACT ME RE THE CLEANER DAMAGE AS IT IS SPREADING"
10/19/17,5,"I have always received excellent service from Audi Maidstone. The staff have a way of making you welcomed and part of a family. They look after as soon as you enter the showroom. The cost for servicing and other elements required from time to time have been very good value for money, I really couldn't say for anymore, thank you Audi Maidstone."
10/19/17,5,"When I needed a new car at very short notice; Cooper BMW in Thames Ditton were there to help. They were extremely knowledgeable and professional. The whole experience was made simple & stress free by Nick Dey, who delivered excellent customer service throughout the sale process. I highly recommend this dealership to anyone"
10/19/17,5,Looked after very well from beginning to end. No pushy sales techniques. I felt comfortable to take as long as I wanted. Friendly salesman.
10/19/17,4,"On 18th September I took delivery of a new car - my first - but my seventh car purchased from Cooper BMW (four from Colchester and three from Ipswich).
I have repeatedly returned to Cooper Colchester because of the excellent service provided and friendly but business-like manner in which they have dealt with me. For this purchase and the previous one in January 2016 I have dealt with Mr Phil Graylen and I have to say that he managed the whole process with courtesy, professionalism and friendliness. I couldn't have asked for more given that such a process can be pressurised and stressful. Please let Mr Graylen know of my appreciation.
So far I am very happy with my new car; it is meeting my expectations and providing for me enjoyable ownership.

Bernard G Turner"
10/19/17,5,"CooperBMW were extremely professional and helpful all the way through the process.They continue to contact us on a regular basis to check we are still happy with our car and the service we have received.
I would highly recommend this company to anyone."
10/19/17,1,"First time at Audi, took my new family car in for a recall, health check and a wash, came out looking like it had been washed with sandpaper , I took pictures for proof of the damage on the same day, spoke to the customer care manager who was extremely rude, took no liability and basically laughed it off, I've requested a damage report that should of been done before and my health check video, received nothing at all not even any paperwork for the work done, opened a case with Audi uk, and they have also basically done nothing helpful, very disappointed in my favourite car brand tarnished by incompetent staff, I will never use Swindon Audi again. Use a different one , very unprofessional and the customer care manager is awful! Very upsetting experience at this place! Do no trust them with your vehicle!"
10/18/17,4,"All in all a good experience. My only criticism relates to poor communication. The car was in for a service and whilst it was there I had asked them to investigate what I thought was a problem with the lights. I heard nothing from them during the day so presumed everything was ok and that they had fixed the lights. However when I arrived to pick up the car shortly before they closed due to being held up in traffic I was informed they ""couldn't find anything wrong with the lights"" despite me explaining exactly what was happening when I dropped the car off in the morning. This instantly annoyed me because I knew there wasn't time to get the issue addressed. Luckily the service manager appeared who then tried to investigate as he was also mystified by what was happening. As it turned out the lights were actually functioning as they should even though no one could actually explain why they functioned as they did. My annoyance is that all this last minute aggravating could have been avoided completely by a simple phone call during the day explaining what they had found and an explanation that that was how they should be functioning. To their credit both the service manager and the young lady on the service desk handled the situation very well considering they were initially dealing with a very annoyed customer. My suggestion would be to actually speak to their customers more, no one turns up at a service desk with a problem unless the really think that there actually is a problem, preempt it and resolve it before it escalates."
10/18/17,5,Just bought my fourth BMW car from Coopers - plus we also have a Mini from them. Throughout the time we have been in contact with Coopers Norwich I have been impressed with all the staff I have come into contact with. You are looked after well from the time you enter their building/s to the time you leave. Nothing is too much trouble - thank you. I would recommend Coopers Norwich to anyone thinking of purchasing a new or secondhand BMW or Mini.
10/18/17,5,Very professional and helpful staff
10/18/17,5,Michael Williams has been most helpful. I have already recommended him to friends.
10/18/17,5,"I started using this company in July, first for a service on my VW Bora 2005. TDI. I am very pleased with the quality of service and their recommendation to change the disk brakes and pads which they carried out a few days ago. I had solid disk brakes before but they installed vented type on the front wheels. The braking efficiency now is incredible; only gentle touch is required for breaking in good time to meet the current traffic conditions. Excellent work and I look forward to any future needs.
The car was cleaned inside and out and is spotless now.

Many thanks"
10/18/17,2,"Poor customer aftercare, emails not answered, phone calls not returned. Poor communication between staff, messages not passed on.
No follow phone call as advised. Mini took the money and ran, very dissatisfied."

10/18/17,5,"I Have bought 2 vehicles from this dealership in 4 yrs . numerous services, 1 MOT, an easily booked and successful recall and all the advice I have needed and they never fail to show me that in 27 yrs of motoring these people have given me the best service. Cannot fault them and they make you feel valued as a customer. 1 particular employee within the service dept also remembers my name each time i go there . . superb ."
10/18/17,5,Absolutely excellent customer service - delighted with car - thank you.
10/18/17,5,Very good at what they do. Good communication. Car always cleaned when I pick it up. Coffee & biscuits. What's not to like?😁
10/18/17,5,The car was picked up from our home and returned after a confirmation phone call. The 2 year service was very through and it was interesting to view the underside inspection via a web-cam. The car was cleaned to a very high standard and from my point of view the whole process was simple and efficient.
10/18/17,5,"Excellent experience with Tetbury Audi, all the staff are super helpful and friendly without making you feel pressured into buying a car! I recently purchased a new A5 Coupe and would recommend anyone to buy here!"
10/18/17,5,"I applaud Hunter's for providing a excellent customer orientated service during my recent visit to have a two year full service of my Land Rover Discovery.

From the friendly receptionist's welcome through to the very attentive actions of their senior service advisor, Jeremy Lane, who made sure my vehicle was ready by the time I needed it and fully valeted into show room condition .Felt like a new car.

The coffee was good too!!

Thank you

10/18/17,5,A warm welcoming dealership with helpful conscientious staff nothing is to much trouble.
10/18/17,1,TAKE MY ADVICE!!! Worst VW ever! Put you under duress to buy a car it's not about what you want it's all about targets! DO NOT PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN IF YOUR NOT SURE WALK AWAY....FAST....Customer service is poor...managers have no empathy and you will not get value for money here...you feel like a £ sign to the sales team then a customer....no reward for loyalty and they give you poor value for money when you exchange your old VW...all in all if they invest in staff and managers like they did the building things may have been better! AVOID AVOID AVOID!
10/17/17,5,"I have already completed a survey recently on the fine service we received from tetbury audi,i have nothing to add."
10/17/17,5,Good honest service from people who seem to have the customers best interest at heart. A pleasure to do business with. My local dealer was exactly the opposite.
10/17/17,5,I had such a good experience. Harry served me and he was great! He went above and beyond and got me exactly what I wanted. This chap deserves a pay rise
10/17/17,5,Excellent customer service
10/17/17,5,"Excellent service, were dedicated to find the exact specification I was looking for where other Audi dealers didn’t seem bothered."
10/17/17,5,Everything was explained and the car ready before time.
10/17/17,5,I visited the Audi Maidstone showroom recently to consider changing my A6 for a Q5.I asked a service administrator Matt who he would recommend I talk to about it. He advised that I contact ANDY KING who he believed to be the best person.What a recommendation. Andy went through all options without any pressure and left the decision for me to make at my leisure. The deal was done quickly and efficiently.Well done Andy
10/17/17,5,"Amazing customer service, efficient and professional work. A pleasure to deal with."

10/17/17,4,"Everything perfect and just as it should be - Except - surely a main Jaguar dealer should be able to update the inbuilt Jaguar Sat Nav? They say they are not allowed to??? I'm directed to a web site, which I've already tried to use several times and so far haven't been able to do it. I just don't understand why this isn't part of the service - or I would even pay for it separately. Apart from that it would have been 5 stars."
10/17/17,2,"Car serviced and cleaned as usually as part of service plan. Problem getting a replacement tyre. I was expecting this was done as part of my Service plan/agreement but not told until 2 days later I had to pay as the damage was caused by a puncture unbeknown to me which wasn’t part of my plan. So to not be asked before fitting or told a price, as may have got a replacement cheaper elsewhere than the dealership etc,etc. Maybe I couldn’t but not given that opportunity. Fault of the Service team as should they have checked with the lease Company before replacing. I did get a little discount but this did leave a bad impression of Lexus Derby."
10/17/17,5,I had an issue with auto start stop after the service but HA Fox Norwich has sorted that out in no time. This shows the amazing service of Jaguar. Well done guys and I must recommend them to every Jaguar owner.
10/17/17,5,I thought all the staff at H.A FOX..wear very helpful and courteous. Can't fault anything.
10/17/17,5,Annual service. Reception staff were outstanding. Excellent courtesy car provided. Detailed paperwork provided. My car was returned having been serviced and thoroughly cleaned inside and out. Cannot comment on cost because the work was carried out under a pre-purchased service plan. A little slow informing me the car was ready for collection.
10/17/17,5,Knowledgeable. Polite. Did what they said they would do. Full explanation. Excellent customer service.
10/16/17,5,Excellent from start to finish
10/13/17,5,"If i could give Aaron Turner at VW Stockport more stars i would!! He really went above and beyond for me today and did his best to resolve an issue with my extended warranty from the car people NOT Volkswagen. He was very understanding and patient even sat me in a quiet space with a tv and handed me the remote to watch what i wanted while i waited. Can not thank him enough for all of his help, help that i’m pretty sure isn't in his job description. I wish all company’s had people like Aaron to deal with the public!"
10/13/17,5,lovely staff would recommend it to anybody
10/13/17,5,"my dealings with Mini Cooper Reading were carried out with kindness and understanding by all staff and I received the car to my specification very quickly and first thing in the morning on the day of collection.

The dealer, Luca, carried out all the necessary paper work efficiently and went through the various aspects of the controls before I finally drove away a very happy and contented customer"
10/13/17,5,"Couldn’t ask for a better service from Nick at Inchcape Audi. From start to finish he couldn’t do More to help me and my wife. Kept us updated with how the build was going, will be going back again in the future."
10/13/17,1,"As a loyal customer who has also put business cooper bmw boldon way, I took my car in for a mot and wish I hadn’t as the Audio system no longer worked upon collection of my car. Cooper BMW disputes this even so the audio stopped working in their care and after calls and emails they kindly offered to fit a new stereo for 500 to 600 even so the system was working fine before I took it to them. I have managed to source and buy a replacement system identical for 125 and fitted by another garage. So the moral of the story is I will never EVER use cooper BMW again as they appear to be more interested in making money that customer care and my next bmw will not be bought from them

From their response below, I contacted Cooper BMW Sunderland (MD letter) but they have ignored my correspondence completely and just aren't interested in customer care and loyalty and so have contacted BMW and the motor ombudsman. The funny thing is that Cooper BMW Sunderland write responses saying that they care and want to resolve things but all they appear to be interested in is making money and don't have the common decency to reply to communication and I will be using Stratstone BMW from now on who are a lot more professional and helpful!"
10/12/17,3,No updates on progress even after being told several times that I would receive calls back .....
10/12/17,2,"I recently bought a car from this dealership and found the sales staff helpful and efficient.

However the quality of ""service"" from the service department which I received to deal with a BMW recall was way below my expectations and that provided by BMW dealers elsewhere.

Personally I shall avoid in future"
10/12/17,5,"Anyone can sell you a car but these people are different. They sell it and then go to the enth degree to look after their customers. I live around 60 miles from the garage and had noticed a small issue with the seat. They drove the 60 miles, left me a car, took the car back to Derby, repaired it, returned the car and even put fuel in it. I have had good service at other Jaguar dealerships but this is over and above the call of duty!
A big thank you to Martin and all the team at H A Fox, I will hopefully repay the good service and travel back to Derby the next time I want to change my car."
10/12/17,5,"Thanks to everyone today who helped with the service of my car, but a special thanks to Sharon (your professionalism and prompt reply of my emails got my business today).Well done Sharon."
10/11/17,5,A very smooth process from start to finish
10/11/17,5,"All of our issues were resolved and we are now very pleased with the Audi’s GB 25. The car is a great
New driving experience. We are pleased to be celebrating 25 years of Toyota making cars in Britain."
10/10/17,5,"Fist class service and updates from my recent purchase. Clear explanations from Ellie the salesperson and good demonstration of the various gadgets within the car.
It is a pity this dealership is not close to my home as I would like the service to be done there.
Even a phone call to see how I was getting on with the Cooper S..
Fantastic little car.....Love it!"
10/10/17,2,"First appt booked with courtesy car. I arrived following a night shift to be told no courtesy car available! Further appt made for collection. I received a call to say a part needed to be ordered, I was told it would be following day. At 17.30 the following day my car still wasn’t returned. I called to be told the guy looking after me was off sick and no one had done anything with my car! I asked for a manager to call me first thing in the morning to let me know when my car would be fixed. On the third day, I had to ring as I didn’t get a call. The manager was busy with other clients! Another member of staff called me to say my car would be ready later that day. I asked for a call from manager. My car was returned, supposedly valeted! And I had a voicemail from the manager saying he would call me back. Still waiting! My car was with them for 3 days! Such poor customer service!"
10/10/17,5,"Friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff. Interested in making sure that the car we chose met our needs. We were not pressurised to make a purchase but encouraged to take the time to make the right purchase for us"
10/10/17,5,"Great service throughout.

Friendly staff, very efficient. 5*"
10/10/17,5,I was very pleased with my recent service at Inchcape Toyota. The service was carried out efficiently and within the agreed timescale and budget and the staff kept me updated on its progress and contacted me afterwards to ensure that all was well.
10/10/17,5,"Adam Harrod provided excellent service and made sure we got the best car to suit our needs, very helpful and polite."
10/10/17,5,"Cooper Teesside is an outstanding dealership and as a returning customer I was once again totally satisfied with the purchase and delivery of my new car. The customer service provided by Stephen Fox the Sales Executive was exceptional, Many Thanks"
10/10/17,5,Very Good xxx
10/10/17,5,"Fantastic Truly customer centric service from Cooper BMW Reading.
There is a genuine intent to make the customer feel at home and leave the service center a lot happier than when one walks in. Right from their sales cycle a year ago till the first service I have had with them it has all been one positive experience and it doesnt happen by chance or luck. There is a lot of positivity and genuine customer care that happens out there"
10/10/17,5,"Professional, helpful and courteous. We were impressed by the way our salesman- Steve- related to us with his help and advice."
10/9/17,5,Excellent customer care. Attention to detail and listened to my requirements which were met.
10/9/17,5,"I recently bought an Audi A6 from Inchcape Macclesfield . We were served by Neil Cameron who gave us excellent and Knowledgeable service , he took the time to ensure that we were looking at the right kind of vehicle and was very patient in allowing us to get an extensive test drive to ensure the car was right for us . He followed the sale through professionally to the end and made this purchase a pleasant stress free process."
10/9/17,5,Very helpful staff. Explained everything very clearly. Would highly recommend.
10/9/17,5,An excellent experience from placing the order to collection day.
10/9/17,5,"They collect the car for the work and return it which is a great help to us, as my husband no longer drives and I have cataracts forming, and cannot drive in poor light on a very busy and tricky road such as the one to Basingstoke."
10/9/17,5,"When we arrived we were welcomed by the receptionist and immediately referred to the technician that booked the car in. The price of the MOT and the time the work would take was explained and we were asked how we wanted to spend that time. We chose to wait in the waiting area. Beverages were offered and accepted. We were offered two drinks during our wait period. The car was available as promised after one hour. We were asked if we wanted the car cleaning to which we asked how much time the task would take. We were told 20 minutes. We agreed to this and were offered another drink. On time the technician took us through the details of the MOT. We paid by credit card and left very satisfied. The car was gleaming and very clean inside. A very enjoyable experience that was warm, friendly and truly professional. Many thanks Toyota."
10/9/17,5,We were looked after efficiently and considerately by Sue of the Bodyshop desk. Everything was explained most lucidly. We came away fully riefed.
10/9/17,5,Smooth professional operation --- almost a seamless process but a little too much paperwork which takes too much time to complete---never the less a pleasant enough experience and happy to recommend.
10/9/17,5,"Very happy with the service of my car, very easy process from ringing to book through to collection."
10/7/17,1,"I actually left a really great review when I first received my car which was from Inchcape Stockport. I went for a brand new one and was so happy with it. However just THREE weeks after receiving it I have an oil leak on the car, took it into my local VW to find the car is completely faulty and I have now been told it needs a WHOLE NEW ENGINE. when asked why I was told it was faulty from the minute it came out of the factory. This was not what I ever expected from having a brand new car. I have since rang the dealer to be told ""vehicles break. That's what warranty is for"" which is just unacceptable. I now already have a courtesy car and won't have my car back for at least 3 weeks. Unhappy to say the least."
10/6/17,3,"Very efficient sales experience when buying a used vehicle but one month down the line after numerous requests, still waiting to receive some basic information I requested. Get the feeling once they've got payment & you've driven off they're just not interested. My first Audi, a great vehicle, but really disappointed with after sales and would not use the dealership again."
10/6/17,5,"Crawley Audi's quality of service is consistently excellent. In fact, I can't think of any organisation that achieves this standard of customer care and service."
10/5/17,5,"We are delighted with our new Golf SE Navigation.Superb build quality,amazing technical features( we love the adaptive cruise control) and the 1.4 TSI engine drives more like a 2 litre! A very good car all round."
10/5/17,3,"Service was ok car was pristine when I picked it up ,the reason I haven’t give a higher rating is it was sold to me without a parcel shelf .that was about 4 weeks ago supposed to have ordered me one but I’m still waiting. rang parts department and they have no knowledge of one been ordered."
10/5/17,5,"I bought my car from halliwell jones Chester approximately 300miles away from me and on driving my car home to Durham it had an issue with the brakes, as soon as I could I went and booked my car in with cooper sunderland they came out for a test drive with me and then inspected my car and agreed the car had an issue with the brakes (all four discs and pads needed replacement) they contacted the dealer I bought it from and after a few days of them questioning the issue i.e. Not wanting to pay for the brakes! They finally agreed and cooper replaced them for me with no cost to myself.
I found both the mechanics and the service department very good, Ellie farrel (service)was very nice and dealt with the other dealership she is a asset to cooper!
Very pleased with cooper and will be bringing my 6 series to them in the future for servicing etc
Thanks again Cooper sunderland !!"
10/5/17,1,"Dishonest sales people, lie through their teeth. Cheltenham VW you should be ashamed of yourselves!"

10/4/17,5,Very professional service from booking in to collection.
10/4/17,5,"Well exchanged a few telephone calls and built up a understanding with salesman called Adam. Got lots of information about the car I was interested in. Got a rough idea how much my car was worth as a p/x. Arranged to go to the showroom. The car was ready to view. The car was exactly how it was described. Got the p/x I was happy with. Adam was no typical pushy salesman. I felt I had time to think the purchase through. I was made to feel comfortable at the showroom with staff being polite. I've had the car three weeks and I'm still smiling. Adam was professional in making the handing over of the car go smoothly. I even spoke with the manager at the showroom call Mike Singh who was very approachable and took an interest in my purchase, even though it was for a used Audi for a modest price. The atmosphere at the showroom is great. I would recommend the garage to my friends and family. I think it'll be the first place I visit next time I want to buy a car. Thanks to Adam and Mike for helping me buy my new car."
10/4/17,5,Looked after from entering the facility until completion and leaving.
10/4/17,5,"Dropped my TT for its first service at 9 ,i was told it would be ready for 12.They ring me 11.30 saying the car was ready for collect,pick it up washed and vac out."
10/4/17,5,Excellent customer service from all staff.
10/4/17,5,Amanda furze great person to work she helped me pick my gtd at volkswagen Romford with and the whole team are great people polite customer service
10/4/17,2,"I brought a Range Rover from BMW in Tunbridge Wells and although the sales experience was OK (just OK), I had to go back to them with a fault. The sales guy took 2 weeks to come back to me after an email and 4 messages I had left. When he did finally get back to me he said that I had to contact Land Rover to get it looked at. Considering i'd spent a large amount of money just 2 and half months earlier, I would expect them to sort it, whether or not they had to take it to Land Rover, you sold me a car that is faulty. After some some conversations back and forth between BMW and Land Rover nothing was sorted, I spoke with the used car sales manager there, Philip Jackson, and all I can say is arrogant, was not interested in my frustrations with BMW and just took it personally. I have ended up getting my car fixed with Land Rover, who by the way are particularly helpful but it's no thanks to BMW. Would never go back here to buy a car... useless."
10/4/17,5,Efficient polite service with everything explained clearly.
10/4/17,4,Great service personal and accurate advice
10/4/17,5,Excellent service from Mike Hughes and his colleagues
10/4/17,5,"I received very good customer service when buying and collecting the car. Blake Jarvis listened to my wants and needs and responded accordingly without pushing ""extra's"" down my throat. No concerns whatsoever."
10/4/17,2,"I have completed two reports already about my recent experience, so I am even more disappointed that I am asked to write review when you already have them. Is this a case on left and right hand!!
I explained twice before and over the phone that my experience that has been very good in the past , was unexceptable this time around.
I booked car in for customer Wait - ephasis on the waiting, for MOT, service and rectify DPF red light. Which incedentially has to be fixed before the Mot.
Arriving at 9.00am Tuesday 12th Sept and not receiving any advise until after 1.00pm I was told the MOT and service has been completed,at the agreed cost of approx £250, but the DPF light hasn't. How they managed the MOT is now a mystery.
It was explained that the engineer working on the car had run out of time? and couldn't rectify the problem. Despite being booked in to fix the problem.
I was then at approx 2.00pm told there are no cars available and the best they could do was to drive me the station, which is rubbish considering I live approx 40 miles away North west of London and therefore no direct route to get home.
I told the service dept that if they cannot guarantee completion of the works then I will go somewhere else. The service team advised me to drive car to them anyway.
I was forced to leave car with them with no real guarantee on when I will receive car back. Advising them I must have the car no later than Friday of the same week they said Ok we deliver it back by them but could be actually the next day.
Things got worse when I had to call on the Wednesday for an update - no one returned my call, trying again on the Thursday, again no one returned my call. Eventually I received a message to say the car is ready and the cost is £881. Some what shocked as this has been a repetitive fault and last time they fixed FOC. Another garage that also had to fix it whilst I was on a journey only charged £40 to fix the fault.

So overall being loyal customer does not count for anything .

Mr G H Jones"
10/4/17,5,Car in for 1st service. Done whilst we waited. Ben managed the process with courtesy and efficiency as ever. We travel a distance to visit Maidstone Audi as preferred dealer.
10/4/17,5,"Very impressed with the customer service, and staff are very friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for Graham Drew, and he is always willing to help, if you have a problem. You always receive a warm welcome whenever you visit."
10/4/17,1,Poor service. Would not use again.
10/4/17,5,"Cheshire Oaks Audi are a pleasure to work with, aqnd buy a car from.
Nothing is too much trouble..
Henry Hughes is extremely knowledgable and personable, whilst being totally professional at all times."
10/4/17,5,"I have to thank Kevin Bobbett who dealt with me on this occasion. Friendly, efficient and above all helpful!

All members of the Hunter’s team both at Chester and Preston are great to deal with. Following a service, my car was returned to me in first class condition.

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the company."
10/4/17,5,"I was looking to upgrade my XF and dealt with Graham Maton who really did his very best to meet my variable wishes and needs and the only reason I failed to upgrade at this time was my own barriers of wrong colour of available used stock ( a white XJ) and a ceiling I was prepared to pay for a brand new XF ( the price was very good but above my stubborn ceiling ).
At all times over a few days and a couple of visits I was treated as a valued customer , kept well informed and given every opportunity to get the vehicle I wanted without any aggressive pitch to take something I didn't really want.
I will return in a while to repeat the exercise when something more akin to my demands becomes available."
10/4/17,5,"Good service, good product, good environment, what’s not to like. Nick my salesman looked after me very well"
10/3/17,5,"A warm welcome, thorough explanation of the purchase process, attention to my requirements and excellent product description and demonstration of the features of the vehicle I chose. Hard bargaining but a fair outcome. I would recommend Hunters to friends and I would do business with them again."
10/3/17,5,I have used east Kent Audi for all my Audi purchasing and servicing and even though the price is fair for a main dealer I cannot fault the service they give you.
10/3/17,5,Brilliant service from Neil and also viktor also! I did use to have a Mercedes but don't think il be going back to that now!
10/3/17,5,"Excellent service,"
10/3/17,5,Very good experience.Jamie the sales executive was friendly professional and we did not feel pushed
10/3/17,5,"Superb service with none of the arrogance that I have experienced at Mercedes and BMW. Maidstone Audi manages to achieve a great balance of national dealership with the full range of benefits that brings together with a personal touch that makes it feel like a family run business. Great staff, great service, great cars."
10/3/17,1,"Poor service, poor communication.
Good luck waiting for them to answer phone.
If you get a service and mot done there. Ask them to complete the service first. I had pre-booked two new rear tyres to be fitted. This dealer then failed the MOT for rear tyres.
I asked for rear view dimming to be looked at under warranty. Message wasnt passed on.
I asked for front number plate to be re-fixed. Forgot to do it.
Need I go on.
12 Months ago I had the car serviced at Mercedes Chesterfield. Service was impeccable by comparison."
10/3/17,5,"Used Macclesfield Audi for nearly 10 years now and will continue to do so. Excellent service from first contact every time. The 2 reception ladies are a credit and always welcoming.
Peter Cairns is my salesman and will not use anyone else. Matt Whittaker in Service and Andrew in Parts deserve a mention too."

10/3/17,5,"Great service, with no big sale tactics"

10/2/17,2,"My car was in to put right work which was meant to have been carried out on previous visit and was done incorrectly.
The new tyre was damaged when refitting and I was made to pay for another new tyre to put this right!"
10/2/17,5,"Professional, curtious, helpfull nothing was to much trouble making the purchase of my vehicle easy and enjoyable."
10/2/17,5,"Efficient and friendly staff from booking in the car for the work to be done, meet and greet when dropping the car into the branch in Crawley, and the update during the work being carried out. Excellent communication from start to finish. First class customer service."
10/2/17,1,Inchcape VW southend serviced my car and on closer inspection noticed scratches to one of the wheels. I phoned the next day and was asked to send pictures of the scratched wheel which I did. That was two months ago and they have not replied. I will not use this company again and will use an independent company in future.
10/2/17,5,"Very pleased with the mini service and MOT to my VW Polo recently.
The car was returned vacuumed and clean.

10/2/17,5,Excellent service in pleasant surroundings.
10/2/17,5,"From first contact with Tunbridge Wells Audi, I couldn't fault the experience. They were professional and friendly throughout exceeded expectations. A real pleasure to do business with"
10/2/17,4,"Great service, very friendly staff and no issues with the vehicle so far. The show room is spacious with plenty of models to check out. The staff are very approachable, finance deals on new cars were explained very well and they have coffee facilities for you to use while you wait."
10/2/17,4,"Great service from all the staff when purchasing the car and at handover. Only disappointment was the car had not been valeted inside to an acceptable standard and the protection guard on the exterior had not been rubbed in sufficiently, there was patches of it showing everywhere."
10/2/17,5,Great professional experience. Extremely courteous and advised about everything that was going on.
10/2/17,5,Fabulous service from extremely hard working staff yet again. This is my 3rd car from Stockport VW and I couldn’t be more thrilled with both it and the overall experience of visiting the branch.
10/2/17,2,"Shockingly bad Customer Service. When buying a £45k car, you might think that that Salesmen would be falling over themselves to help you select the car and, once ordered, keep you up to date on the progress of the order. I was still trying to get a Reg Number out of them the day before I picked up the car. Took 3 weeks to get a refundable deposit back and only then after emailing the Dealer Principal. Not the sort of experience I expect from a BMW dealer, particularly one who boasts about their Customer Service."
10/2/17,1,Waited 45 mins after booking in time to hav car serviced and only after I complained did they take my car from front to service bay mine was first of day at 8am but was not even put up on ramps until 8.51am
10/2/17,5,"Great service, I knew what I was paying before I went to the garage.
All the people were really helpful"
10/2/17,1,"Took my passat estate into their Bolton dealership to have a timing belt and water pump done, as everyone knows this is a big and expensive job hence the reason I wanted a main dealer to do the work for peace of mind. I took my car down to them and couldn't park anywhere, the car park was flooded with cars dumped all over the place so I had to just leave it blocking cars in. My car was left with them over night and returned back to me at my home address the day after. The delivery driver left it on the street so I came out and moved it onto my drive, I then noticed a huge scratch on the roof of the car !. I emailed the service advisor and advised her ( Anna Fletcher ) of this and also the fact the book wasnt stamped ( after her telling me she would double check before it left ). She asked me to come back down and I got the book stamped and she looked at the scratch. She then asked me to wait until her manager was finished chatting so I waited 20 mins then told her I couldnt wait any longer. She told me once she had spoken to him she would email me back but never did. I emailed her again ( so I had everything in black and white ) asking her what was going on. Anna rang me today and basically told me "" the scratch could not have happend in there "" How could it not have happened in there ? is there some sort of bubble the cars are kept in I don't know about ? I have now threatend them with legal action."
10/1/17,5,"They have been servicing our RX400H for the past 11 years (from new). Really nice helpful friendly people who you can trust. They always do an excellent job, most recently a new water pump and drive belt.
Definitely recommend them. We will continue using them."
10/1/17,5,"No problems.All good.
Roy Liggett ."
9/30/17,5,"We dropped into Audi ... looking around with the Q3 in mind but had not dealt with Audi cars before, although had drove TT many years ago. We had the pleasure of dealing with Martin Taylor from inception and we must say that his customer care skills were exceptional. We we informed and re-assured all along the way. He sourced the car we wanted very quickly, and fully matched our needs. He was knowledgeable, chatty about things that mattered to us and personalised the conversation. The paperwork was dealt with promptly, and he even went out of his way during the evening to e-mail for any information that was required. On the day of collection Martin had everything to hand, he'd even shown us in the ware house the same model and colour so we felt re-assured. Every function on the car was fully explained, and even petrol was in the car too which was a surprise. Martin went out of his way to ensure our experience was outstanding and would recommend him and Audi to any future buyer. Thanks Martin for all you have done, just perfect and the refreshments you arranged during our visits went down very well thank you."
9/29/17,5,"Brought another car from here and can't complain at all with the service.
Overall it was professional and customer support was great.

Well done."
9/28/17,5,"We had the great fortune to be approached by new car sales consultant, Steven Chambers.

9/27/17,5,"Recently had my C63AMG serviced at Mercedes benz Coventry and all I can say is what an excellent service I was given, Cannot speak highly enough of Ryan Garlick the service manager I was kept up to date on everything, my car was clearly handled with great care and attention. I will not take my C63 anywhere else but this garage. excellent"
9/26/17,5,"We have just purchased a new vehicle and from start to finish everyone in the team has been friendly, professional and knowledgeable. Paul Brotherton in particular was excellent to deal with!"
9/26/17,5,"5 star experience from walking onto the site through to purchased vehicle handover process.

Our best experience of car buying ever, made even better as this is our first Lexus and first hybrid, our best ever buy , outstanding vehicle quality and drive. Love the car.

Add to this the car handover process was unrushed, thorough and every detail, any questions, properly and professionally answered.

Thanks you to Lexus Derby staff, well done."
9/25/17,5,"I absolutely would recommend Toyota, no reservations whatsoever they were really good and informative with the car i wanted and where attentive to my needs on what the car would be used for"
9/25/17,1,"DO NOT USE CRAWLEY BRANCH!!!!
If I could have put a review down at 0 stars I would have!
Booked in for a Full service, That apparently they managed to carry out in under 30 minutes! Which was meant to be free as part of the finance package I took with them and they insisted I paid the £150 for the Oil!!
To top of they left the Air filter cover off and I had to call Audi assist out!"
9/25/17,1,"Arrived at Hunters Kings Lynn at 8.16 am this morning, simply to leave my car for attention to a front wheel noise & leaking brake calliper. I had ordered a courtesy car at least 10 days before. I was asked to sit in reception by a young man, not what is my name or would you like a coffee. After 25 minutes I got up & asked at reception what was going on? They eventually took details of my car, driving licence for the courtesy car, but could not confirm whether this work was covered by warranty, although on booking the appointment I was told that it should be. A lady on reception told me that they would need my car for the whole day, & as I had driven 55 miles to get there I asked to have the car for another day, as I really did not want to drive home & back yet again in one day, over 200 miles! I was asked to wait in reception again while they got the courtesy car. after 15 minutes I asked where it was, we're just sorting it I was told. Another 20 minutes went by, I was seething with rage, my car was eventually found in the shambolic car park area, where there were so many cars parked it was ridiculous, & then we found that the car only had a little fuel, so I asked the guy to put some diesel in. As I drove off the time was 9.56, I had spent an hour & 40 minutes at Hunters while the staff faffed around like old women to accept my car & get the courtesy car out. Absolutely pathetic & a Customer service disgrace,!!!
Above the reception in large letters is the word SERVICE.
That is one thing that this shower do not provide!
Not only was my morning gone by the time I returned home, but I was in a really bad mood due to the unfriendly & incompetent attitude of the staff.
even the Manager was in a staff meeting when I asked to complain to him."
9/25/17,1,"Don't go here if you are on motorbikuty, I honestly don't think they want the custom, as a terminally ill cancer patient, as a first time motorbility customer , in July I explained that i needed a car as soon as possible, and was told September ... I ordered the GLA paid a deposit .. and waited... I got a phone call beginning of August & told all still on track... in September I rang them? Nobody rang back as promised , eventually I was told that due to something happening in the factory it would be November ? No appolagies? I explained that as somone given a 6 month to 2?year prognosis this wait was now taking up a considerable amount of my life expectancy. I was told somone would phone me back?? Again no call.
I phoned both Audi dealership about the Q3 and BMW about the X1 explaining the situation . Both phones back in under 20 mins, after a car search said they would be able to get me a car in under 2 weeks??
I asked Mercedes to cancel my order, and return deposit, after re ordering with BMW , they phoned motability as Mercedes had still not cancelled order! BMW sorted it all out and I am expecting my X1 next week.
The service was poor, the attitude belligerent I would not recommend to my worst enemy.. if I had any."
9/23/17,5,It was an excellent service. I am very satisfied. Thank you.
9/23/17,1,"Having travelled from Northern Ireland to collect my car, negotiated day to suit the salesman’s availability round his ‘speeding course’, the car was not prepared to even an average standard. It was dirty, items missing and I was treated with a very flippant attitude. Follow up was worse, incorrect paperwork and abusive text messages from salesman. Manager contacted and promise of response but not upheld. The worst car buying experience, ever to date. AVOID and go elsewhere!"
9/21/17,5,took delivery of our new c class Mercedes estate today at Warrington.. We received excellent advice and guidance in our considerations in which car would suit our ' needs' best and within our budget through out the process of wanting to replace our current car. The service from the moment we walked into the showroom for the first time was friendly and reassuring as it is a big 'step' financially to buy a car for us. If you really want good help in buying a new / used Mercedes then ask for Graham O'Connor you will not regret his professional friendly guidance
9/21/17,1,"Horrendous customer service. I was assured things time and time again, delivery dates, location of delivery, documentation status... the list goes on. If you aren't going to send me documents today because you don't have them, TELL ME. If you explain: The earliest I can get these documents to you is tomorrow. Then I will say: Thanks. Ok. Don't constantly try and blag things hoping that things will arrive or happen or come to fruition when you know they wont. All it does it leave a sour taste and horrible peer reviews in its wake. I will be thoroughly recommending that no one utilises this firm."
9/21/17,1,I noticed a BMW X1 advertised at Norwich and after checking by telephone that the vehicle was still available for sale I had a 25 mile leisurely drive to Coopers showroom where I was greeted and introduced to the vehicle in question. After a thorough visual inspection I was invited to carry out a test drive which was completed satisfactory. Was then invited back to the office for coffee and to commence negotiations to part - exchange my vehicle only to be informed that the prospective purchase had been sold to another depot. A complete waste of a day due to very poor sales systems resulting in complete anger and frustration. Will not be returning.
9/19/17,4,Good service friendly staff and a good dealer.
9/18/17,1,"Looked at Land Rover website that directed me to Hunters of Chester website as I was looking for a new or nearly new Land Rover Evoque and was contacted by online chat rep Rebecca. Told her I was interested in an Evoque that was advertised with mileage stated as just 7 miles I was informed this was somewhat wrong as it was an ex-demo, but over a week later it is still advertised as just that. Rebecca advised me she would get a sales executive to send me a personalised video of the car and confirm mileage etc. She also took my home telephone number so they could check whether I was happy with details they would send me. Nearly two weeks later heard absolutely NOTHING from Hunters such rude ignorant and wholly unprofessional behaviour is inexcusable I am surprised Land Rover allow this to happen in dealerships they are associated with. Definitely a dealership to avoid if this is the way they ignore you when you are trying to buy a car heaven help you if you ever had a problem that needed addressing!!!!!"
9/16/17,5,"I found a used GT86 online and it was one of the only available in the country so wanted to move fast, I spoke to Patricia regarding the car and the same day I paid a deposit and she took the car off sale! I haven't dealt with a company so prompt and precise before, Patricia was so friendly and did everything to ensure the sale went smoothly, even sending a video of the car for me to look at before I came to purchase it and arranging delivery for me! The car is excellent and I'm enjoying every minute of it.

All in all a fantastic experience, everyone at Inchcape were friendly and welcoming and made it more than worth the 200 mile trip! Would recommend using Inchcape and wouldn't hesitate at upgrading my car with them in the near future."
9/16/17,5,"Had my car serviced today, best personal service I have experienced with a garage, looked after by Tim Scott, really friendly and very helpful. Thanks"
9/16/17,5,Excellent communication and regular updates. Hire car delivered to my house- brand new Discovery- and my own car delivered back before I expected it. Excellent service all round. Thanks to Jeremy for the good communication
9/16/17,5,"Very helpful staff and excellent service. If you live in the Norwich area, HA Fox is the place to take your Jaguar to be serviced. They will provide another car while yours is being serviced or collect your car if you require them to. They advise you when they expect the car to be ready and it is valeted as well."
9/16/17,5,Great service from start to finish.
9/15/17,5,Excellent service and friendly and knowledgable staff
9/15/17,5,"Bought an approved used.

Easiest purchase I've ever made. Wasn't spending much more than £13k but treated as though i was spending £300k"
9/15/17,1,I absolutely love my car... But the issues that have come with it are just laughable now. The car (XK) has been back into Jag now at least every other month for one thing or another over the past year. At one point they had my car for two weeks! I simply just don't understand why! No job takes that long! People on the phones are always extremely apologetic and lovely but it doesn't excuse the fact they don't seem to be able to communicate or organising anything. To top it all off... I haven't even got my car back yet- which I was supposed to have yesterday- but I have got an email asking me to review them!!!!!
9/15/17,4,Made very welcome with a professional service without any pressurisation to purchase. Car was demonstrated and explained fully and an extensive test drive given. The service received at both the Nottingham and Derby branches was excellent.
9/15/17,4,"Our current Toyota Aygo is the fourth new car we've bought from Inchcape Toyota @Burton. Overall the service in the past has been excellent, both with sales and servicing. Our recent visit (August 2017) was for the Aygo's first service, which was carried out whilst I waited. Inchcape also changed the interior bulb for an LED bulb I supplied - no additional charge was made for this. The video of the visual health and safety inspection was available to me whilst I waited. The car was cleaned and vacuumed after the service. The reason the review only earned four stars, was due to some niggles after taking delivery of the car :
1. difficulty getting a second remote key
2. difficulty getting a service plan set up
3. the wrong multimedia manual being supplied with the car (Touch 2 rather than X-Touch).
It took about three weeks for the first two points to be rectified.
As regards the X-Touch manual, I again asked for the manual this August, but was told that neither Parts nor Sales had any manuals. I find this difficult to believe as Inchcape must have sold at least a couple of new Aygos since August 2016."
9/15/17,5,"The service I receive from Lexus Guildford is always outstanding. it is easy to book the service and may car is always ready on time. The staff are knowledgeable and courteous.
The service and care I receive was one of the deciding factors when I replace my last Lexus."
9/14/17,1,"mis sold a car advertised as black and on delivery it was grey.
not only that it was dirty hair and grease all over the seats and dash. missing cupholder rubber insert. wipers were worn out needed replacing.
refused to return my calls eventually customer services made them call me and the kept refering to different persons and eventally said the would refund me but 1 week later called and said cant do antything.
i have all the conversations recorded and emails kept. i will be taking legal advice now. DO NOT BUY FROM HUNTERS CHOOSE ANOTHER DEALERSHIP!"
9/13/17,1,"Appalling, appalling, appalling.

It's like dealing with a collection of cowboys.

Unacceptable mistakes, eye wateringly rude and aggressive.

I lost clients and lost money, in addition to having to spend money, because of their mistakes- being dealt with and spoken to, in the most disgusting way, including an implication that I had attempted to deceive out of £40, when adding up insurance costs I've paid out, due to their mistake- customer experience doesn't get worse than this. I have never had such a bad consumer experience."
9/12/17,2,I put a £500 no obligation holding deposit on a used car but a few days later decided not to go ahead with the purchase and so I requested a refund on the card with which I paid. I was told it would be arranged. A few days later I rang to see what had happened to it and was told it would be chased up and that someone would ring me back. No-one rang and so the following week I rang again and the refund was finally put through on my card. When I asked why they had kept hold of my money for 9 days after I requested my refund they just made some lame excuse about admin time.
9/11/17,5,"I took my Z1 to these guys to have what I and they initially assumed was a small issue. As they fixed this, they discovered another potential fault that would have bigger repercussions further down the line. Not only was their comms outstanding throughout to provide the best options for me to choose but they also went about including most of the work in the initial service as well so they proactively reduced costs. Everything they said they would do, they did and all well within a timescale that I felt was super quick for the jobs they undertook! Top garage and top staff - thanks! Gary."
9/10/17,4,"I have been dealing with MB Warrington for a number of years, most recently in June 2016 to buy a brand new car.
There were a few issues since then and I was having difficulty getting them resolved and unfortunately had to escalate the issues. However, once this happened they were dealt with fairly and efficiently. Any problems in more recent times have also been dealt with in a more appropriate manner so clearly they are improving all the time.
My experience of buying the car was flawless and I would have no hesitation in buying my next car there, provided the same sales person is there, as he created the right experience through his attention to detail and his conscientiousness."
9/8/17,5,"We called on the off chance that a BMW X3 we saw on the website was available for a test drive, Stan Kriel answered the phone and sent me a short video for us to have a look at the car prior to us test driving the next day. We had driven an X3 on a previous test drive from a local BMW dealer who emailed after a month to see if we had any further thoughts ! Needless to say we wont be going back there ! BMW Thames Ditton on the other hand were so helpful, Nick Dey took us out on the test drive and when we got back to the showroom we sat with a coffee and spoke about purchasing the vehicle. Nick and Stan were honest, fair and we did reach a compromise on the purchase price and they took our 16 year old faithful BMW 525 in part exchange.
They have gone above and beyond helpfulness for me whilst my husband has been in hospital, sorting out an alloy wheel repair. I cannot thank them enough for they kind, considerate and compassionate approach to my situation. I would not hesitate to recommend them and their team.

Karen and Peter Matthews"
9/7/17,1,"Oxford Mercedes Dealership - really poor experience. Looking to purchase an AMG model from you. Got the run around, broken promises and ultimately made to feel like a really second class customer."
9/7/17,1,No issue before my car went in for an update came out with only one side of the climate controls working booked back in only to spoken to like it was my fault and asked to pay £307 and this is why I never go to main dealers absolute joke now nothing works so angry when all I done was bring my car in to you as asked.
9/6/17,5,"Thank very much to Emma Kingston at Stockport Audi.
The whole service was great, very friendly and efficient.
Emma's knowledge and advice of repairs that needed attention on my Audi A3 were outstanding and relayed to myself very clearly (who has no car mechanical knowledge) the advice was top class.

I will surely be visiting Stockport Audi in the future.
Thanks Emma!"
9/5/17,1,"Had good service last year. This year it was not good at all. I expected my car to be washed/valeted as part of my MOT + Major Service but this was not done.
In addition, I asked for a valuation of my car as I was thinking of selling and this was not communicated between staff and I dod not receive a valuation. So overall, pretty shoddy service."
9/1/17,5,"Collected My new Q3 today. Was very pleased with the presentation and level of customer service I received.
Thank you Inchcape Audi Stockport and in particularly Sales Exec Martin Taylor.

A Big Thank you From Garry Jackson"
9/1/17,1,"Today i visited Inchcape Guildford appointment booked. First issue being that I could not utilise the two disabled bays as non blue badge drivers using spaces. So I had to leave my disabled mother in my car on a double yellow line. My appointment booked and having being assured 10 min max to sign I thought I would not have too much issue. However after signing one piece of paper I was duly left my the sales person as they had to deal with an unexpected customer with an issue. 10 mins later left in a side room I was assured my paperwork was on its way then I was asked to fill in more paperwork and duly left for another 15 mins even though my paperwork was on its way. Initially complained about bad customer service and being dumped for another customer I was told the delay was due to the manager being in a meeting. When I finally got fed up and was approached by another sales person I was asked if I had a scanner and then that printer was not working. The thing is you should have a customers paperwork ready for the time of their appointment, you do not leave them for another customer mid appointment and thirdly make sure that your colleagues get their stories straight. Totally bad service and makes the customer feel a low priority once an order has been placed. Also said email I was assured would be sent to me has not so little faith in getting my vehicle next week!!!!!"
8/30/17,1,"Woweeee.... am I fed up with Mini Cooper Tonbridge. Every time I have to phone to get through to one of the extras I paid for the phone lines are always busy.... I've just discovered they charged me for new tyres when they were part of my original package.... it is such a shame but I would never own another Mini because of it. Great product until it goes wrong, then you have hell to pay to try and get it fixed and expect a big bill - whether you are supposed to pay it or not...."
8/29/17,1,"Inchcape VW Bolton - Service Department

I had my car booked in for a full service last week which was a major service 140K and asked if the timing belt could be replaced at the same time which was the original belt from new. Now the complications in that the car is due its MOT in less than a couple of weeks which I took it to a different garage for the MOT who told me that the front wheel bearing had gone so it should not pass. I explained this to Inchcape service dept and asked them if they could get a wheel bearing in so that they could replace it whilst doing the service to which they agreed.

I used their collect and delivery service which is quite good an usually works well so they collected the car at around 9.30AM and I left it with them in good faith. It took until 4.00PM for them to ring to advise me that they had carried out a health check and there was a problem with a wheel bearing, the very same one I advised them about a few days earlier and low and behold they carried on to let me know they didn't have one in stock therefore would not be able to do the job on that day. Furthermore, they hadn't done any servicing on the car, not a tap. This was a Friday on a Bank Holiday weekend and they said the options where to leave the car with them until Tuesday or return the car as it was. To say I was annoyed would be a slight understatement due to their complete incompetence and surprisingly enough they didn't have a courtesy car available.

The car is a fleet vehicle and they decided to use the tact that the fault was with the lease company delaying in approving the various works so all there technicians were on other cars by then etc but be reminded it took them until 4.00PM to give me a call. I asked them to return the car as to was and told them although I am not a paying customer will do everything within my power to prevent Lex from using them in future and certainly for any work on this vehicle.

Further conversation with Lex revealed that the details regarding times of applications of regarding the work required and approval were grossly different to the ones given by the Inchcape. Lying to customers is not a good tactic to use in my opinion hence part of my reason for writing this in the hope it puts other customers off using them. I have been able to direct the car to a different non VW but approved garage for the work which may not be to the standard or as expensive as a main dealership but gives me some satisfaction to know that I have been able to influence them losing a very small proportion of business and repeat customer.

Good bye Inchcape...."
8/29/17,5,Helpful staff & good service. Only downside is they get booked well in advance.
8/28/17,5,Professional and knowledgeable service in a nice relaxed atmosphere. Easy process with no pushing for a sale. I would recommend Lexus Derby to anyone.
8/26/17,5,I had a great experience helped by Emma Fasulo and later Elliot to enjoy my new car
8/26/17,1,"Terrible service from cooper mini in Reading . Jason Martin , shame on you sir . Responsive right up till he took £20k of my hard earned cash - then a different story . Such a shame one salesman sours the reputation of the whole group. Plenty of other dealerships out there - this is one to AVOID ."
8/24/17,5,"Very professional operation and people. Extremely welcoming, but not pushy or aggressive in the slightest. Our experience of Lexus cars has been excellent - we were trading in a 12 year old Lexus for a 4 year old model - and the sales process was as painless as you could hope for bearing in mind the amount of money you are spending! The deal struck felt fair from both ends, and the car was delivered as promised with a full service plus a few unexpected extras thrown in."
8/24/17,3,buying process was smooth but on collection vehicle has not been valeted inside and had to be returned and even on review still wasn't to a level you would expect from BMW main dealer. Second hand car (approved used) and slightly second hand service!
8/24/17,5,"Just picked up my 4th car from Cooper Ipswich, the great service that I have come to expect just got better, thanks and we'll done!"
8/24/17,5,"Just got my 4th car from Cooper Ipswich, the usual high standard of service I have come to expect over the years exceeded. Well done!"
8/24/17,5,"My son recently purchase a A1 from Inchcape Stockport. The service he received from all the staff especially the salesperson Rebecca (Becks) was 1st class. The service and advise given was excellent, so much so i returned myself a week later to purchase a Q5. Again excellent service.
Please pass on a massive thank you to Rebecca from both of us

8/24/17,1,"Either incompetent or corrupt. I took my VW for a safety recall recently. Coincidentally, there was an electrical fault that I had diagnosed as a relay fault. I asked them specifically to look at this, having told them it wasn't the fuses. 4 hours later I took a call from their customer disservice rep to inform me that after £96.00 worth of diagnostic tests, the rocket scientists in the workshop had confirmed it wasn't the fuses. 'Have you checked the relay I asked?' No, was the answer, but for a further £96.00 they would check. I told them no, and hey presto! My car was ready. When I came to collect it, I was smugly informed it had been washed and vacuumed. Washed with an ear bud, and vacuumed with a hair dryer maybe, as it was in the same condition as when I left it. And the result of the safety recall? Still waiting for a reply to my email.

Essentially, 'Smurf Knight Fail / Inchworm' haven't managed to get right a single point of the four things they said they were going to do. Not one. No safety recall check, no investigation into the relay, no wash, no vacuum.

You'd get better customer care in a Stalinist gulag. Strangely enough, having gone to an independent auto electrical garage, the fault was in the relay, and this was replaced promptly. If I could give a 'no star' review, I would.

When I returned to discuss this with their complaints department / a passing manager who was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the right time, then I was informed that the air conditioning had been re-gassed... strange how this wasn't in the invoice. The job sheet was checked, and added in blue pen was 'air con regassed' when the original engineer had used a black biro. Strangely enough the manager speaking to me had a blue biro. Coincidence, nothing more. I invited him to check the air-con and it was still devoid of coolant - like it had been all summer. Anyone would have thought the 'regas' hadn't taken place at all. It must have been a leak... Now awaiting the result of the (free) air-con check. The plot thickens..."
8/24/17,2,"Felt completely let down by Bilal, who said he would call me when my car was ready to collect but didn't, he then lied and told me that the dealership closes at 18:00 when they actually close at 18:30. To sum up I love my BMW and have used Cooper Croydon for servicing before but this time found the service assistant to be unreliable and dishonest."
8/23/17,5,"Having driven the same car for nearly 19 years, I was a bit apprehensive about buying a different one. In the event, I found the whole experience absolutely fine. Great environment, very friendly and helpful salesman - Carlos Goncalves - who put me at my ease and understood when I was nervous about the test drive!"
8/23/17,5,"Organised a visit to look at a chip on the paintwork of my brand new 430d. It wasn't clear whether this had happened before or after I'd picked the car up so was expecting a debate. However, the dealer fixed it without any drama while I waited and the fix is invisible. Excellent work and great after sales car. Staff extremely attentive and polite during my wait"
8/23/17,1,Dishonest Sales staff and very poor customer service together with a customer car park with no spaces. Unreturned phone calls. Used to be good and helpful but those staff have gone and the culture now stinks.
8/23/17,4,vehicle returned well valeted and all updates done so the car is running smooth and quiet. My one gripe is the cost £434 when the dealer in Liverpool charges £245 and Lincoln £358.
8/23/17,5,As alway professional and always exceeds my expectations
8/22/17,1,"Went in to purchase a vehicle for my wife. Saw what I liked, however was serviced by a junior staff member. Tried to have as much patience as possible, but eventually got tired of answering to a script. It was a painful experience.

I purchased the vehicle without the need for financing, however was given the run around due to Copper company policies, and not BMW policies. Vehicle was held ransom until I produced a insurance certificates, despite the email confirmations not being acceptable. (The insurers certificate portal had technical issues).

All in all, I am satisfied with the vehicle, but would seriously caution you to ensure that you don't get the newest junior salesman. This truly was an un-pleasurable experience, and will not return. Bitter disappointed, as it is a beautiful dealership.

COOPER BMW...step up your game and learn how to handle your customers professionally."
8/22/17,5,"Great service, great car, really impressed. My Mini Cooper S is everything I thought it would be - and more!"
8/22/17,5,"James at Ipswich Mini was, as always, very friendly and very helpful."
8/22/17,5,"Great car, great customer service from Dan"
8/22/17,5,"We are extremely happy with Coopers BMW,, by far the best garage experience we have ever had. Customer service levels are exceptional."
8/22/17,4,The excellent attitude of Gemma the sales exec. was the reason I purchased a mini !
8/22/17,5,"Superb customer service.
I had my XKR in for a full service, the job was done on time, car washed and vacuumed, a health check emailed to me. Needed 2 rear tyres for MOT, they were fitted for far less than all the fit free centres could do, and the service price was very competitive.
Great service reception staff, 100% professional and helpful."
8/22/17,1,"Disgusting back street service.
I purchased a XE Sport from this dealership, very helpful until they took my £24000 . No phone call after sales contact at all.
Turned out the car needed extensive body work doing to it which slipped past their QC service. After bringing this to light honered the damage by way of repair and 6 weeks later got my car back, not one phone call to help me out and let me deal with the paint shop and hire cars. Also I was promised a 5 year service plan free of charge for the inconvenience and after contacting them 3 times in two months still haven't received anything in writing which I requested.
I wouldn't recommend this dealer ship to my worst enemy , it's been a very stressful time for me trying to rectify a fault which wasn't my personal problem to do so.
My wife purchased VW from Norwich and the after sales service was second to none, phone calls, emails , letters and even flowers, it would be nice to see the the staff retrained to this standard or even half this standard at Fox Jaguar Norwich !"
8/22/17,5,Very professional
8/22/17,5,Excellent in every respect.
8/22/17,1,"Was not happy the way things were handled
Trying to sell me a car that needed work done to it"
8/22/17,2,"The Sales team were very helpful, but the car was not well prepared (wipers needed changing, tail gate rattled), and the MOT was originally not supplied, and then when it was, the mileage was overstated by 10000 miles."
8/22/17,5,"The whole experience, from making the booking, through to dropping off the car and eventual collection after the Service and MOT, was first class. Thanks."
8/21/17,5,"Easy to deal with in order to set up an appointment over the phone to view a car I had seen online. Responded quickly when I changed my mind on what car to test drive at the last moment.
Very friendly and welcoming on arrival with a nice modern waiting area and I was offered a hot drink.
Sales advisor, Malcolm, went to a lot of trouble to explain how a hybrid engine worked through the test drive and was willing to answer any questions.
The piles of paperwork required to buy a car these days was kept to a minimum and often had been pre-filled before collection making it as smooth as possible. No hard sell on PCP / finance etc. once I had made it clear that I wanted to pay cash for the difference between my part-exchange ( fair price given) and my Lexus.

Have taken out a service plan and expect the customer service will be as excellent as this was."
8/18/17,1,Been waiting for a call back since Wednesday afternoon how hard is it for a simple call back I'll take my business elsewhere thanks look at the reply same template every time like talking to a robot best number and time to call back on I've provided that to the one in Derby that's what my complaint is about no call back received leave my number again what so I wait for a non returned call again dont waste my time I'll go to a private garage instead of a stealership bet they call me back goodbye
8/18/17,1,"Disgusted with the level of customer service offered here. Particularly with the dismissive,obnoxious and unhelpful tone of Natasha, one of their advisors.
On booking the service I was told one set of information, only to be called whilst the service was being carried out and informed that the level of service required was a more expensive one and that I needed my break fluid changed, almost doubling the cost. When I asked why they booked me in for one service and then told me they needed to carry out another level plus additional work Natasha was extremely dismissive and rude and informed me that this work was standard for a three year service.... Well, why didnt they tell me this before hand!
Had I been informed of this before hand I certainly would have shopped around.
VERY UNIMPRESSED AND WILL NOT BE RETURNING!"
8/17/17,5,"Great advice, help and support choosing and buying a new car. Thank you."
8/17/17,5,"I am entirely satisfied with my recent experience where the service was exemplary and all the people to whom I spoke or met ,were unfailingly courteous and efficient."
8/17/17,5,All of the staff were really helpful and efficient
8/17/17,3,A perfectly good service executed with technical competence. Marred by a desire to offer an 'experience' rather than simply execute a service and MOT
8/17/17,5,"After little response from a local dealer to my interest in purchasing a VW, I saw a used vehicle on the VW website on sale 80 miles from home at Inchcape, Bury. They arranged for me to visit. I was given a good opportunity to look around the particular Golf model (that I had not previously been able to examine) and to test drive the advertised vehicle without any pressure to buy. I decided to purchase and the whole transaction, including part-exchanging my old car, was completed in one afternoon with no problems. I drove home in my new car."
8/17/17,5,"Very good service, helped me get to town and back again with a tired 4 year old."
8/17/17,5,"I found the whole experiance very satisfying, everything was dealt with in a timely manor and I got the car I wanted and am very satisfied with, I would recommend Inchcape Cheltenham to anyone who is looking for a new car at a great price."
8/16/17,1,"Volkswagen Southend Inchcape- is completely destroying the brand reputation through poor customer service. My family made an appointment to purchase a used car from the garage, and did not receive the video presentation as promised, and Ian Clarke was rude uninformative did not empathise or take into consideration that we had taken time off and made arrangements for this appointment. Last minute on the day, he decided to push the sale away by saying the car was faulty brakes, was not working, how its not worth selling even though it is STILL listed on the website for sale. This is not what a sales representative should be doing. He did not offer any alternative cars or solutions , and was extremely rude by mentioning our time and travel arrangements has nothing to do with the company. Absolutely disgusted at the awful experience. I understand that this is a franchise of VW but it has made me really hesitant to purchase a car from this brand if the sales service is so unprofessional."
8/14/17,1,"I have been having so much trouble from VW UK,

They will not honour their guarantee for rust on my van even though a report that was done by an independent inspection has said the rust on my van has been on there for 8 or more years witch is not true as the van is only 8 years old. If the rust has been on the van for 8 or more years does this mean that Volkswagen are painting rusty vans and selling them anyway?

They would not let me use a company of my choice and I had to use someone they supply. They are now not willing to talk to me about this matter any more and have closed my complaint that I have made when they have not resolved the problem.

When I first asked for the report that was done I ask someone from the executive office at VW UK who said that he would first read the report before he was willing to send it to me. I have been trying to go above these people as they are rude and are not willing to try and resolve the problem.

I am looking to seek legal advice against VW over this because they will not accept responsibility and have basically said that the van was already covered in rust when brought.

At this present moment in time I would never buy a Volkswagen again and would not recommend them they will do any thing to try get out of doing something.

I am now trying to contact people from VW in Germany to try sort this problem out.

Don't trust the warranties or guarantees Volkswagen give they mean nothing and if you Google them you will fined no end of people complaining about them."
8/14/17,5,"I spent some time visiting the main competitors, but they fell short against H.A. Fox's Customer Service. On every visit I have been treated very politely. All the staff are experienced and provide answers on the spot which has avoided renting a replacement for the day. There was no pressure placed when purchasing my car, and all was explained clearly. I made quite a number of email enquiries which were all answered quickly by Camryn Bishoff. My XE is an amazing drive and it just gets better every day. One cannot fault H.A. Fox Preston and would recommend them to all looking for quality car."
8/14/17,1,"I have been a customer of Cooper BMW Banstead since the 1980's and with the previous dealerships based at Banstead (L&C and Cronk).
It has been a couple of years since I used them for servicing, however their customer service has deteriorated significantly.
I rang the branch to enquire about servicing costs and about which Inspection service was relevant for my car at its current mileage. The woman did not have a clue about any technical aspects and it materialised that my call had been routed automatically (beware!) to Coopers' call centre in Norfolk. They could not find my car on their system - it has been serviced there several times - and said they would get back to me on the fixed price servicing costs; needless to say, no call back came.
I rang again two days later and insisted on being put through to the Banstead branch. I left all my details and they said that someone from the servicing team would call me back. It has now been several days and I have not heard a thing. Are they now more interested in Minis and misrepresent their capability and interest in servicing BMWs?
It is shocking!"
8/14/17,5,"The service at Inchcapeaudi is first class. The staff are friendly, expert in their field and we did not feel pressured or hurried. Able to take time to review the cars for sale we both felt well informed and were impressed by the presentation of all the vehicles."
8/13/17,5,"Always friendly, professional and helpful at hunters. All the staff are great especially my favourite stephen Shortland. Thank you all for making my experience so smooth x"
8/13/17,5,"First class service, very impressive dealership and staff. Peter was our sales advisor an he was amazing, his knowledge of products and his support in finding the right car for us was superb. The whole process was seamless Peter stayed in constant contact with updates on when our car would arrive and has converted me to a BMW for life. Brilliant sales advisor highly recommend"
8/12/17,5,A totally pleasant experience from beginning to end! So pleased with the sales team and the new car. Top marks all🏅
8/11/17,5,"We had no problems at all from day 1 when we walked into the dealership
to the day we picked up our new cars. ,Our salesman Peter completely looked after us , keeping in regular contact up to delivery, and after to make sure all was ok. Excellent."
8/10/17,2,"The service was returned late and I wasn't convinced that the work I was told needed doing actually did. I also wanted to talk to someone about possibly buying a new Toyota. On both visits, no-one was available. They were at a Kia so potentially changing manufacturer. Shame, Inchcape used to be so helpful"
8/10/17,5,I have now bought 4 Toyota cars through Inchcape over the last 14 years and have been pleased each time.
8/10/17,5,It is always a pleasure to go to this garage.We are looked after very well and nothing is too much trouble for the staff.I am always satisfied with the work done so would thoroughly recommend it.
8/10/17,5,Martin listened to what we wanted and found the best car to meet our needs. Very good service.
8/10/17,5,Service was excellent as always
8/10/17,5,They arranged to pick up and redeliver my car at no cost The fault was only a loose nut but it was fixed at no cost Great service
8/10/17,5,The Vehicle was picked up and delivered at the agreed times. Very convenient process
8/10/17,5,"I received excellent service st Toyota Basingstoke when my Aygo was serviced in July. More recently I called in unexpectedly with a noise coming from the engine which turned out tone the bonnet catch and was helped within minutes, service you don't experience very often these days"
8/10/17,3,Work completed satisfactorily but took much longer than time quoted (I was waiting for it to be done) but no additional work carried out.
8/9/17,5,Amazing customer service and follow up from Brian at Inchcape Chester. Sold us a fantastic used Golf and went out of his way to ensure we got the best deal possible. Plenty of cheeky banter along the way too. Thanks also to Paul (dealer principal) for helping to get the numbers just right. Would recommend these guys to anyone.
8/9/17,5,"I've just had a recall on my Range Rover from hunters Guildford, nothing major. I would like to mention the fantastic staff there , Tom Pentecost who was sooo helpful and very polite in every way. He really is a fab member of the staff who went out of his way to help me... he got my car sorted for me and returned it washed and polished... nice to go to a showroom and be treated like royalty. Thank you."
8/9/17,2,"Well I had to wait at the garage for four hours while my finance was approved! Also collected my car with two chips in the window and small dent in the door. I was told that as the chips weren't in drivers view mini didn't need to fix and the dent was fixed as best it could be! It was a 17 plate with 2500 miles on the clock I was assured on email that the car was in ""mint"" condition which clearly it wasn't. When I handed over my BMW it was in mint condition it also took Mini Cooper Thames ditton nearly three weeks to clear my BMW finance thus making me have 1200 worth of car payments come out my bank account ie my BMW and Mini payment. My hubs and I will be buying a x5 at some point and will not be using this place again. If you're thinking of buying from them I suggest Seek another dealer. Not a happy customer at all I have had three minis in total 2 from another place and two bmws again from
Another place."
8/8/17,5,Very helpful with well trained staff who know how to deal with their customers

8/8/17,5,Lucy the salesperson was really good to deal with. No pressure selling technique worked for me and I'm now the proud owner of a car I never dreamt I could afford!
8/8/17,5,"Just lovin' my new Mini Clubman, can't thank Molly enough for amazing service, help and patience to ensure I made the right decision - awesome service, just like it should be!!"
8/8/17,2,"Took my car in for a replacement tyre to be fitted. I was told the change would take around an hour. Two hours later, still there, no explanation as to why it took so long. Poor service indeed."
8/8/17,5,"Friendly, professional service, nothing was to much trouble"
8/7/17,1,"Cheltenham branch miss-sold us our VW and told us to our face that it wasn't affected by omissions when it was, spent months trying to get a response from several managers and directors, none would reply, even VW head office tried to make them respond to me. I wrote to my MP as they shouldn't be allowed to get away with misleading their customers. When we took our car in for the 'fix' the engineer said 'off the record' we weren't the first who had been mislead! Don't trust them."
8/7/17,5,An excellent new car buying experience from start to finish. Highly recommended
8/7/17,5,I received excellent service from Nick White. He was very helpful and friendly without being pushy. I would definitely recommend.
8/7/17,5,Very polite service done in time picked up car & delivered in very clean condition
8/6/17,1,"Awful, just awful. Sold me a brand new faulty car (which was on the job card) and then refused to take it back. After months of still paying for it (which was NOT cheap) and not even driving it (it was at Hunters for about 3 months) I had to go via ombudsman and I finally had it refused!! I would NEVER recommend them to anyone. The customer service is diabolical, and never heard from the salesman who sold me it. If you want a Land Rover go to Cambridge... anywhere but Norwich Hunters 👍🏻"
8/5/17,5,Great service from Audi sales. Treated like a king and the car is fantastic. Would recommend to anyone.
8/4/17,5,"Have recently bought a Discovery5 from Hunters. Bought some years ago but never been able to do business with them over the last 8 years. However on this occasion found the team to be welcoming. Kept me informed regarding the delivery of my vehicle and we're always at the end of the phone to help at any time .Mr Paul Brotherton Sales Executive was outstanding from first entering the dealership to delivery of the vehicle. Service were also excellent when asked for accessories to be fitted. The whole team 5* .
Would recommend."
8/4/17,1,"Had an initially poor experience with a new salesman (Andy) who was so keen to make the sale that we were a bit mislead. By the time the car was ready for collection he had left the business and Jordan dealt with the vehicle handover. In fairness Jordan's attentiveness and professionalism temporarily restored my faith in Hunters, and obviously we were delighted with the car. 12 months on and the car is coming up for its first service - having purchased the optional service pack this should be relatively straightforward.... or so you would think! But after contacting my local Land Rover dealership it appears the national service agreement was never actually set up. 7+ phone calls (and counting) to Hunters and I am still waiting for a call back over a week later. Having spoken politely to a number of members of staff in the service / sales departments (none of which offered any form of apology) I just keep getting passed around and around with everyone claiming it's a sales issue and not their department at fault. Whilst I'm not expecting miracles, it would be nice to get some ownership when something goes wrong - or at the very least an apology. Frustrated and disappointed. Just remember there are plenty of Land Rover dealers around - it might be worth travelling a little further to get a decent after sales service, because that's when it will really matter!"
8/4/17,5,Just bought a new car from Easr Kent Audi. It was a great experience. Sam the salesperson was brilliant.
8/4/17,5,"Perfect Service, perfect sale perfect after sales, cracking company"
8/4/17,2,Bad experience
8/4/17,5,Excellent service and good feedback on the vehicle
8/4/17,5,Excellent service as always. I am always well looked after when I go to the Swindon centre.
8/3/17,5,"I would have no hesitation in recommending Inchcape Chester to anyone after my experience in buying a used golf from them recently, from my intial phone enquiry to driving away in the car, I received a first class service, there was no hard sell just a very helpful sales guy who explained everything, answered all our questions and made us feel at ease all the way through the transaction. If your intetested in a VW them give them go."
8/3/17,5,Excellent Service
8/3/17,1,"I recently rated my servicing/mot experience highly. However, I received an invitation to a 'we want your car' event. I went to my afternoon 'appointment' but when I arrived, I was asked to wait whilst the receptionist let the team know I was there (which was OK). However, the receptionist noticed that I was still unattended some 15 mins later and she let me know she would follow up and ask the team to look after me. When she returned, she said that the team had said they were all a 'bit busy'. I thanked her and left.

I did feed this back by replying to the event invitation - but heard nothing.

Hence my minimum rating"
8/3/17,5,"Customer since 1999 ( under previous ownership as well) . Have bought 4 Land Rovers from them since and had all servicing done by them. Very satisfied and always well looked after by Hunters. Well done to the service dept, some staff of whom I have known for a long time."
8/3/17,5,Very professional and polite with good knowledge of the VW range.

8/1/17,1,"I felt that I had to write this review because I could not believe that I would have this experience with BMW. I am a huge BMW fan and had only own BMW cars and it's been 19 years now. I want to name and shame them because it is unacceptable. I rang 4 BMW agencies 2 days ago (Thames ditton, Canterbury,Enfield & battersea). I wanted to know what was the ratio of my rear differential for my BMW. None of them could tell me and all of them said that they will call me with the information. Till today none of these agencies have got back to me. I managed to get that information with Partsgateway. Imagine that BMW cannot give you technical information about your BMW - you should be worried."
7/31/17,1,"I am sitting in the electric charging bay of the Inchcape wirral showroom. I have been into the showroom and hovered, a girl was changing the water in the coffee machines. A salesman was fiddling with a Turag but no customer with him, a couple were in the sevice waiting area, waiting expectantly, and a custemer was at a desk waiting whilst papers were being coppied. There were 4 other personnel seated or wandering back and forward talking smongnst themselves. No one in the time i was there approched me to enquire if I wanted help. And to top it all the shelves for brochures were empty. I drive an outlander PHEV and as I am close to retirment am looking at the VW Golf GTE but never now from Inchcape."
7/31/17,1,Took me for test drive in car that was already sold . Waited 5 days for reply about another car that I'd paid deposit on . Don't return calls so Took business elsewhere and still waiting for deposit refund 2 weeks later after being lied to about a cheque being posted out .

Lee from Warrington"
7/30/17,1,"They have broken what was a very good car. lied about it needing fixing when it wasn't broken, now broken and lie about the cause and refuse to fix properly. customer service is a joke (not the people on the phone just the whole system and cover up). To be honest the list goes on and on and on...... you get the point
And now that the size of the cover up is starting to come out more people are being hit negatively with cars that now don't work rock bottom trade in prices if dealers want them at all. Now the issues are know it could lead to a complete ban on diesels. And yet no admission or apology from this corrupt group of manufacturers."
7/30/17,5,"From walking in to H A Fox's Jaguar in Preston I was welcomed by Ryan smith who was very helpful and knowledgeable about the car I wanted. He was also very patient as over a two month period I changed my mind several times, regarding colour and spec. The experience of buying my dream car was made an extremely pleasurable time, I was not pressured and my partner and I were welcomed and attended to very well (the coffee is excellent) I would recommend H A Fox Jaguar Preston to anyone wishing to buy a new or used Jaguar."
7/28/17,1,"Hunters Land Rover in Norwich

Avoid buying from this dealer. They do not fulfill promises made on vehicles and the work they carry out to get you to drive away from the forecourt can only be described as a ""bodge"" job.

I recently spent a lot of money on a used vehicle from this dealer on the pretense that it was in fantastic condition and certain preparation work was to be done before I bought the vehicle. ( I was buying from over 200 miles away and thought I could trust a Land Rover dealer.) Within a week of having the car I noticed that the refurbishment work they had carried out was disintegrating and looked awful.

I have contacted the dealer and have found them less then helpful and have tried to be fobbed off with it is a used car. I have email proof that certain work was to be taken out. It turns out this Land Rover dealer don't seem to have a level of standard or pride in there work.

This wasn't the service I expected from a Land Rover dealership.

Please take my advice and steer clear."
7/28/17,1,"We have a 3 year old A6 it has been in the service department four times for a fault with the radio, it keeps cutting out for approximately 4 to 5 seconds. It may go two days without a problem but then returns.
Audi Macclesfield have been unable to cure the problem and even doubted the problem existed until it was seen by a Audi technician and photographed by my wife.
I now have the car back after four days , nothing was done , 100 miles was added to the mileage and we were told to switch the radio to FM rather than listen in DAB, this was the advise from a extremely arrogant Carl Morgan, now why didn't I think of that.
We change our car every three years but due to the very poor assistance from the service department its back to BMW for us."
7/28/17,1,"We love the car but the experience with Cheshire Oaks team was unforgetable but for all the wrong reasons. It took over 6 weeks to get things sorted out - not very good for a so called dealership!!!! The service light still hasn't been dealt with, the service confirmation never received and the mileage was 12000 over the advertised mileage and they couldn't or WOULDN'T explain it. We would never deal with them again"
7/27/17,5,"After going around several garages to look at Jaguar's at Audi's I stumbled upon HAFOX of derby . As a female I was at times treated with some sort of scepticism that I would be purchasing a car , I found trying to purchase a new car actually really stressful , I have been a company car driver for twenty plus years so this was all new to me. I expected the experience to be fun , it was far from it after seven car garages visits five demonstrator cars lost , I arrived at HA FOX in derby as I really wanted an Fpace , I met Martin who was exceptional , his experience shone through everything he said he would do , he did , returning calls, trying to find me the exact car I wanted , I have since ordered a brand new Fpace from HA Derby and would throughly recommend them to anyone , their service , approach and honesty was second to none , and more importantly for myself they made the whole process easy .."
7/26/17,2,Full service booked in. Service was done less than 1 hour (told normally it can be around 2 hours). Booked in 9-30. But told car was needed at 9am and so work couldn't start in workshop until 10-30 and yet was telephoned at 11-35am car service was completed and ready for collection. No outside inspection was done and yet there was now damage to the near side alloy wheel. Low mileage car and parts were replaced. Not convinced all were required. New Service Manager far from helpful; blamed me for bringing the car in late! Offhand. Far from impressed and charged the full rate of £335'. Will service elsewhere.
7/25/17,5,"I came to audi for some help and advice were i met a young professional lady who introduced herself as Robyn Moloney. i have had many cars over the years from all dealerships mainly high end german cars and i have never had as good service as i did today and the last couple of days. she went above and beyond to help me even though i got the answers i didn't wanted to hear about my car (few issues with my car) she did everything in her power to help me and make me feel better and at ease. she explained everything from bottom to top and the ins and outs perfect service.
audi should be honored to have robyn moloney working for them, she is an absolute credit to the company.

PS.Query solved by other means."
7/24/17,1,"Have been looking at one of their cars for about a week. Advertised at just over 55k. First got though to a sales-rep called Josh (confirmed car was is available) who wasted my time by not getting back to me all day even though he said he would.
On my third attempt and much to my frustration in trying to get an update, I asked to deal with someone else, i was put through to another sales-rep called David who then proceeded to strait forward lie to by claiming that the price advertised was incorrect as of the day before and that his boss is now driving that car.
Time wasters, fib tellers and unprofessional.
Not what you'd expect from the apparently new Land-Rover.
I'll take my commerce to another manufacture."
7/24/17,3,"Do you think that less than 20k miles is a reasonable life for a Lexus supplied and fitted shock absorber? Lexus Derby and Lexus UK do.
Normally excellent service but this instance is shocking. Over £400 for one shock absorber and it fails well within the normal expected life. Because it's outside the paltry one year warranty Lexus refuse to budge.
Not what one expects of Lexus."
7/24/17,1,"Terrible business. They are amazing when you purchase a car, can't help you enough but if anything goes wrong don't expect them to help.
}we have an issue with the paint on a two year old mini. They are refusing to help, refusing the fact there is a paintwork issue and will not do anything to put it right.

Add to the fact we had been sold with ""Paint protection"" that now we realise was never on the vehicle, I think it's disgusting behaviour and I'd really strongly advise people to buy there vehicle ANYWHERE else other than this dealership.

Rude, unhelpful and misleading.

All if you buy a dark coloured mini expect it to mark very easily and for mini to say that this is standard. Poor paintwork, poor value. Over priced."
7/23/17,2,"Very good service whilst I was being sold the car. Once I had the car that's when it all went wrong. It was returned for a couple of chips to be sorted and rear sensors to be fit. They had it 4 working days and I had to ring to establish when the car was going to be available.
When I collected the car, I wasn't happy with the work. I am still awaiting a quote for sat nav to be fit and when the poor workmanship is be to rectified.
Considering this is such a prestigious brand, I'm extremely disappointed at how I've been treated."
7/23/17,5,"We had excellent service from our Cheshire Oaks salesman, he kept in contact throughout every stage of our car purchase helping us with our option choices, giving good advice at every stage. We are very happy with our purchase and look forward to many years of happy Audi ownership."

7/21/17,3,Whilst the service and the whole experience is very good after having £300 worth of work done I did not expect my car to be returned dirtier than when I left it with them.
7/21/17,3,"Slow service. It took 40mins to collect my car after taking it in for a service.

Service history wasn't updated on idrive system. Service department didn't seem to appreciate the inconvenience of having to take time out of work day to bring car back in."
7/21/17,5,The highest standard of service I have ever received. Thank you.
7/21/17,1,"I am a long-term customer at Inchcape Chelmsford. My last and recent visit for a first annual check-up was far less than satisfactory. I found the staff unhelpful, and intimidating when I made reasonable point that it should not not take nearly three hours for my car to be serviced when I had been told when booking it would take at the most one hour 30 minutes. The cleaning and valet service was sub-standard. Inchcape seems to have lost its way with customer service."
7/21/17,5,"Excellent, professional and friendly service.
Davis Sherwood did what he promised to do when he promised to do it. He gave an excellent test drive explaining different aspects of the car. He was totally professional and made the car buying experience a very enjoyable one.
I also felt that the company gave me a very fair deal."

Come on - get a grip"
7/20/17,5,Good knowledgeable people who always seem happy to help. They have the edge with experience and customer service which is why i trust them with our BMWs.

This was the most exceptional customer experience. My salesman, and general mentor through the whole journey, Mr Syed Ali worked so hard to make the experience a good one. This gentleman knows what it takes to give good customer service, and it shows. Thanks to him, Jon the Sales Manager, the Finance Manager, and Tamara the Service Manager. You definitely have one extremely happy customer Inchcape VW Swindon. Mark C"
7/19/17,1,"This is my honest review of Hunter Land Rover Norwich.
I initially booked my 2012 Range Rover in for a service on I was told by the service desk that the car needed an oil and oil filter change, Fuel filter and a pollen filter change. I was quoted £640. I cancelled the service. Shopping around I got the parts £34.00 Oil filter £16.00 Fuel filter £51.00. All genuine Land Rover parts. Oil from Opie oils at £80 for 10 ltrs of Shell Helix Total

I then rebooked my car again at this time telling them I have my own pats. They weren’t able to give me a price for the service until it was complete. Dropped my car off. Got a call 4 hours later, telling me the car was ready. Price for the service was £200. The service advisor initially refused to stamp my service book and clear the service warning, stating that they didn’t carry out the full service, After a discussion the service book was stamped and the service indicator cancelled. Clearly they weren’t happy I’d brought my own parts.

I have a tracker in my car, so I can see online when the car moves etc. Car was in there garage for 47 minutes, £200 for 47 min is good going. Then the fun began.

I drove home, about 30 min, then my wife went to pick our 9 year old daughter from her friend’s house, the car broke down, Car would turn over but not fire up, there was plenty of fuel in the car. I got a lift from a friend and went to the rescue. I have a Gap IID tool that reads faults, the fault was fuel system.

I called Hunters, who dvised to get the car recovered to them. I explained that they had changed the fuel filter and now I have a fuel system fault. No other help was forthcoming. I told the service advisor that I was traveling abroad for work at 6am Monday morning. I decided to get my car recovered to my home, Cost £70) I’m not a mechanic but wanted to see if I could see what was wrong. It was late in the day, and my wife was stressed. The next morning I noticed some diesel on the driveway, under the fuel filter. I again contacted Hunters, and the same advice was given, get the car recovered to them. Which I did Cost £100). My car was in there car park for 3 and a half days. I was watching it. I then got a call late Friday telling me the low pressure fuel pump had failed, cost to fit new one was £400. They would have to order one and it wouldn’t be there until Monday. Saturday my family and I went to our local carnival. Saturday evening I checked my tracker to find my car had been out driving around for 20 mins at 11:30 that morning. No phone call telling me the car was working, and considering the new pump wouldn’t be available till Monday, I was very upset. Again they knew I was abroad Monday. I decided to go to Hunters on Sunday, I took my spare key, I knew exactly where my car was (tracker) car started no problem. I then went into the showroom and asked to speak to manager. I explained my concerns, in that I felt that Hunters weren’t happy that I’d bought my own parts, and that I felt that the fuel filter was incorrectly fitted, and allowed air to be sucked into the system (only speculation from some forum members as I asked the question). The fact that my car was now running, in absence of the new fuel pump, and the fact that the service advisor knew I would be out of the country for several months on business. I called Hunters on Monday afternoon, from abroad. Service advisor informed me the replacement fuel pump arrived on Saturday, and that the mechanics fitted it immediately, they then took the car out for a test run, Ye right. Indecently Duckworth Land Rover quoted my £160 for the new pump, this pump is situated on top of the engine next to the fuel filter, there’s 2 hoses and an electrical connecter, Duckworth told me it would take less than 5 minutes to fit. I explained this to Hunters, all I was told is that you come to a main dealer you pay premium prices. That was all, no other explanation or comments, just pay and we’ll deliver your car back to you.

I’ve had the car 1 year, it’s been dealer serviced (not Hunters) from new, so I was keen to keep this going I feel like Hunters have ripped me off big time. I will never use them again, Having done some research there are some good independent Land rover specialists with good reputations in Norfolk. So if you have money to burn and customer service and satisfaction are low on your priority, and you don’t mind being ripped off, use Hunter Norwich, I know I won’t

I full understand I’m not the only customer Hunters have, it takes weeks to book a service, I understand your busy. Hence my car sitting there for over 3 days. What I’d like to know, as the service advisor informed me of the problem, via a phone call that was after 5pm on Friday, to confirm I’d like to go ahead with the repair so he could order the part, I’m advised it won’t be at Hunters till Monday, but it arrives Saturday, then the very busy skeleton crew, as I was informed by the service advisor fit the part immediately, then take my car for a test drive at 11am for 20 mins. Very fishy to me

7/19/17,4,"Over the years we have had several vehicles from the Toyota facility in Derby including a Land Cruiser, a RAV 4 and a Hilux Invincible Pick-Up all of which have given us trouble free miles for a considerable length od time.
This is due to the diligent workmanship of the Toyota technicians at the Derby premises and the knowledge of the support staff who arrange the services and the occasional repair work.
A very much deserved ""WELL DONE"""
7/19/17,5,A great buying experience. Many thanks for your help.
7/19/17,2,"Tetbury Audi
My car went in for an ""inspection and oil change"". There was obvious visible damage to the wiring insulation right at the front of the engine compartment which had been caused by a rodent. They didn't notice this during the ""inspection"" which made me wonder whether they had actually lifted the bonnet. I had to ask them to go back and have a look at it.
Anyway, I accept these things happen. Perhaps the engineer wasn't concentrating on the job at the time.
The Reception team and the service manager who dealt with me were very friendly and helpful and professional.
But what really aggravates me is the fact that they have contacted me with ""satisfaction surveys"" five times now.
The first one was a telephone conversation. I explained what I wasn't impressed with but the line was poor so I asked her to call me back.
Someone did call me back but knew nothing about the previous conversation so I had to start all over again.
Now I have had three more web-based ""surveys"".
I responded to the first of those by explaining what I was unhappy about. Then I got two more ""satisfaction surveys"". They start by saying ""We hope your recent visit to Tetbury Audi exceeded your expectations.""
This all confirms my view that surveys are a waste of time. If the company doesn't actually read and respond to what their customers say, why do they keep asking? It reinforces my view that they are doing this only to make the customer think they are interested.
Incidentally I love my Audi A6."
7/19/17,5,Efficient friendly service.
7/19/17,5,We had a really good experience here. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was no pressure or pushing and we were very satisfied with the service.
7/19/17,5,"I have recently bought my 4th Audi. I have never been let down in service or quality. This time I was looked after by Jonathon Meigh. He was professional, knowledgeable and highly motivated, he was also personable, caring and understanding.
I would have no hesitation recommending Audi Macckesfield and in particular - Jonathon."
7/18/17,5,Tetbury audi is a very good friendly dealership.Just had car serviced and a recall checked.They were happy to offer free loan car which is more than Bristol offered although I bought the car from them.No brainer where the next car may come from.
7/18/17,5,Excellent service nothing was too much trouble and I came away with just what I was looking for. We would definitely recommend Tetbury Audi
7/18/17,5,"Excellent experience from first contact, to driving away in our Q3."
7/18/17,1,Bought a new car (A3) two years ago. First service (3 new tyres needed!) cost me £850. Not sure why I bothered replacing my old car.
7/18/17,5,"Excellent service.
I have been using Audi now for over 5 yrs. and the service is always excellent."
7/18/17,5,"I recently bought a Q5 with Chris at Audi Hyde, he was very professional, helpful and told me all i needed to know.
I would highly recommend Audi Hyde to family and friends, they care about their customers!!"
7/18/17,5,"I bought my RSQ3 new from you in June 2014 and yesterday I brought it in for its first MOT.
I had a short wait to book it in and was offered a nice cup of tea.
Once booked in I left and returned a couple of hours later. The MOT had almost finished and this time I dealt with Liz at reception.
Again I accepted the offered cup of tea and after a few minutes I saw Gareth Cooke, who went through the results.
My car had passed, but the technician,Stuart Bright had found that a rear brake hose had a small cut in the outer casing and this would have to be replaced, luckily for me under warranty.
This is why I bough my car from Cheshire Oaks Audi because I love the way the after sales and service teams, especially Gareth treat me as a valued customer.
I have read some of the not so pleasant reviews on you web page and I can honestly say I have never been treated with anything but professionalism and attention.
Can you please pass on my thanks to the people I have mention plus everybody else at Cheshire Oaks Audi."
7/18/17,5,Excellent service from start to finish. Well worth the drive up from the south coast.
7/18/17,1,Forget to reset my service interval warning after service. Longer than expected wait. Poor.
7/18/17,5,Very helpful staff. Quick and efficient service. Always get get service when I see them. I had a really busy day and they were able to fit in my timescales
7/17/17,5,"I own a Land Rover , and have been having quite a few problems with the dealer in Derby. I approached H A Fox , who are the Jaguar dealer in Derby, as I know they have a Land Rover trained mechanic .
I was greeted by the service manager, Mr Martin Hines, and also Mr Robert Gidley , who between them explained all about the service that Jaguar give, along with the details of the vehicle service I was enquiring about ...
I felt confident so I booked my discovery in for an MOT and service.
When my car went in to the workshops , it was also given a complimentary health service check,, and I was given a courtesy loan car, as I live in Nottingham.
When I went to collect my car, it was raining hard. but Mr Gidley still went outside and got drenched by fetching my car from the car park to the front door so I wouldn't get so wet.
The Customer service ( and coffee) was excellent .
Thank you Mr Gidley, and Mr Hines ......
I most certainly will be back in the future"
7/17/17,5,"The service received from Tom and his associates at Fox was excellent and I left feeling that the deal achieved was fair (obviously never as good as one would like). Insurance, vehicle road tax all sorted very quickly, agreed the deal Wednesday late pm and picked up the vehicle 3pm Thursday with no difficulties and hassle free. The downside would be the number of add-on services offered such as interior conditioning and wheel insurances etc but the choice is with the customer to accept or not."
7/17/17,5,"Always very helpful, keep you informed of any issues."
7/17/17,5,"I'm certainly pleased with my C-HR - and Pawel, the salesman. was very helpful and personable."
7/17/17,3,"Preston Branch - Overall a reasonable service provided, just spoiled by a couple of factors I have outlined below:
1. Incessant pestering with phone calls, SMS messages and emails, before and after a booking despite previous requests to stop this. Requests to complete surveys, phone calls even to say a survey is forthcoming! All very annoying and invasive in my workday. I appreciate this is commonplace now but HAFox is way OTT!
2. Sometimes the little jobs get missed. EG during a recent visit I mentioned a metallic rubbing noise under full lock and I was assured it was something and nothing and would be fixed. I collect the car drive 20 miles home and hear exactly the same noise when slow maneuvering. Rang to advise (not even sure I am really speaking to my own branch!) and I am advised to re-book in for a full day and pay £10 for a courtesy car. Again annoying.
3. Overall prices are very much on the topside EG £50+ for a pair of wipers, £270 rear pads. Aircon regas £99. All of which are 50% cheaper non dealer but guess what - I still take it to Jag and in the main I keep smiling!!!
4. Always seems unclear (to them) about my Jag Service Plan and I have to always remind them its in place (usually when being presented with a sizable bill!)
On the positive side overall its quite a nice experience and a good opportunity to look over new models in the Showroom which otherwise I would not do. The service guy (Ryan) is polite and courteous and they provide a clean and comfortable courtesy car along with a wash and vac to mine. Same in a way, as the most of my niggles probable don't originate from the actual branch, rather a call center somewhere for the whole Group!"
7/17/17,5,"I was able to easily book my car in for service on a convenient date and the dealer was able to arrange a courtesy vehicle. On the day of the service the handover and receipt of my car was handed swiftly and efficiently and a full briefing as to what was going to be done was given. I needed my car back by a certain time and the dealer was able to comply with this by a number of hours. My vehicle was returned washed and vacuumed and full service documentation was provided. All in all a very, efficient, smooth, professional and punctual performance by H.A. Fox"
7/15/17,5,"I would recommend vw Macclesfield to buy and service your car, I've had excellent customer support for years."
7/14/17,1,"Do I really have to leave 1star? I was invited in to Stockport Inchcape so turned up ready to discuss my next new car. As a customer of 8 years I was disappointed to be totally ignored. I was left waiting half an hour to then be told the person I had the appointment with was off sick! I could hang on for someone else but might be another 15/20 minutes. I just said to the guy 'oh, forget it!' No opology, or how can we help? Etc. He just said 'if you're sure' and off he went. I then sent an email about this bad experience and 1 week later, still no reply. They actually couldn't care less about you. Considering the purpose of my visit was to buy a car, you wonder why they are even there! Rubbish, VW isn't what it used to be. I won't be going again so my advice? Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere."
7/14/17,1,"Bought my first brand new car from the inchcape Mercedes branch in Leicester. I Feel let down by their service have numberous times tried to contact the team, wanting to book in time to test drive potentially my next car and have either not been called back or left on hold.
I have since bought my car out right and wouldn't recommend Mercedes Benz of Leicester to anyone considering buying a new car from them.

EDIT : I sent an email as per inchcapes reply with details to arrange a call with me; they didnt call me at the time specified and still have not. Terrible service as per in branch."
7/14/17,5,"It was my first time buying a car alone when I came to Inchcape Volkswagen and as a young female who doesn't know much about cars, I was nervous. Gordon put me right at ease and made me feel like I was being looked after. I have just picked up my new VW Up and I couldn't be happier. 10/10 experience and would definitely recommend. Thank you Gordon!"
7/13/17,4,"Sales staff exelent and dealership are highly recommended.

Slightly disappointed with car preperation. Large chip on roof( Furtunatly dealer agreed to rectify in Cople of weeks ),dust in internal crevices and stale coffee in cup holder, areas of car turned Hazey like the protection not completed. Otherwise car prepend to high standard.

Dealership highly recommended.

I will update l with progress"
7/13/17,4,Sorted some initial small issues promptly. Service team have excellent communication. Recommended.
7/13/17,1,"Over the past week we have tried to book our car in for its first service. When we purchased the car we were quoted £200 for the first service. We have now been told it will be £300. I have questioned this, been transferred to different departments, and promised on three occasions a call back which we are still waiting for. I have just rang again and have been told someone will ring me back. This is our first time dealing with mercedes and I don't think we will go back here for our next car."
7/13/17,5,"I've been using the Inchcape Audenshaw Paint & Body Center for years, first for general maintenance of my Golf GTI Edition 30 and subsequently for repairing my new Golf R - which was involved in a heavy collision which destroyed the front passenger corner. I made sure that it was sent to Audenshaw after the collision and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. The car looks and drives the same as when it came out of the showroom six months ago. Excellent service, and will always put anything you aren't completely happy with right in short order with the minimum of fuss. Hearty shout-out to Inchcape Manchester, who have looked after my Edition 30 for 9 years with no complaints."
7/13/17,5,"Excellent service and processing from beginning to end, I picked the car I had wanted, had the process explained and options outlined, very happy and will be a customer again in the future."
7/11/17,2,"To all those people who think this company is whiter than white - think again. I bought a car; remotely me in Herefordshire they in Essex, via finance and was completely let down after the contract was signed. I had test driven the same model locally but bought the actual Golf GDT I wanted from afar and boy do I wish I hadn't. I used to have my incredibly well looked after Fabia VRS which I sold to this outfit for a mere £1k.

First; the person which delivered it only had one key with the second one coming much later; Second; the tyres, although legal, were quite worn as pointed out by the police in a random stop, Third; I bought GardX which probably covered up the rolling stone chips and scratches but cost me over £500.00 and they failed to deliver the washing product that comes with it.

I had to Email and make phone calls to get satisfaction all to no avail. Only after ringing Volkswagen Group's customer care unit did Inchcape actually bother to get off its butt over some of these issues. So unlike Ebay where the customer is king not so with Inchcape. No money back for me for Inchcape failing to get it right and how to ruin the customer experience."
7/10/17,5,Good customer service with a degree of flexibility.
7/9/17,1,Only interested in the first sale once deposit paid very little response and zero follow up or after sales. DO NOT reply to emails either. Cannot recommend. Feel ripped off over the paint guard protection. Only took 45mins to apply and cost a small fortune. Disappointing.
7/9/17,5,great service and support
7/9/17,5,"HUNTERS GUILDFORD TOP SERVICE
Deciding that the family car for the next decade at least was going to be a Land Rover Sport we visited several dealerships to find the right vehicle. We purchased our nearly new LandRover from Hunters recently and are very pleased with both the car and the service we received. We would highly recommend Hunters Guidlford. Having been to a few dealerships in seeking out the right vehicle, the service offered at Hunters was by far the best. Their salesman (Lee Khan) responded to our initial email enquiry very promptly with accurate and helpful information about the vehicle in question, and on further contact he took time to understand exactly what we were looking for, and listened. He was knowledgeable about the car and personally met us to show us the vehicle we had discussed. Immaculately dressed, very organised and with a professional and comfortable manner he was helpful and polite throughout, and not at all pushy - we felt he understood this was a long term purchase and highly important to us and there was a sensitive approach which we appreciated. Thank you Lee and all at Hunters."
7/9/17,5,First class expert service.
7/8/17,1,"We decided to buy a Defender 110, when it was delivered it was totally rusty, water leaking through various holes, heated seats not working, Windows leaking!!!! We part chopped our car but we were not happy with the first price they offered us for our car, they agreed to give us an extra £1000 pound but unbeknown to us put it down as a dealer contribution, when we returned the defender as the garage manager told us that the defender should never have been put up for sale anyway, they unwound the deal and we asked for our car back, it had been sold even though they knew we were unhappy! They refunded us MINUS £1000 their explanation 'oh it's a dealer contribution you don't get that back sorry'. I fought to get it back as we are a hard working family and £1000 is a lot of money, I am going through the processes to get our money back and to bring these cowboys to justice!
If by any chance Inchcape reads this please as a reputable company refund our money that is duly owed!"
7/8/17,5,Fantastic staff and service! Highly recommend!
7/7/17,3,"We ordered a new 320i and chose a high gloss shadow line trim finish. I confirmed this via e-mail and was assured this was the case. The car is fine but we are very disappointed that we did not get the trim finish we had ordered. Apparently, so we have now been told, the trim finish we wanted was not available on the model we ordered. Had this been made clear to us during the ordering process, we would have ordered a different model. The manager has agreed to change the trim around the windows but not the wing mirrors, saying this is not part of the trim. We feel that not changing the mirrors will detract from the overall look of the car. The cost of changing the mirrors apparently would be £1300 and we have offered to split the cost but the manager is not agreeable. There are signs everywhere in the showroom stating that they want the customer to be completely satisfied but clearly this is not actually the case. This negative experience may well have a bearing on our decision when we next change the car. It may be that BMW will no longer be our first choice as has been for our last 4 car changes.
A Few Weeks Later
When the car was having the trim changed round the windows, my husband had a lengthy discussion with the manager and eventually he agreed to change the wing mirrors and split the cost. Some people may think we were being too fussy but now it has all been done the car looks exactly as we expected it would when we ordered it. In reality we shouldn't have had to do ""fight"" for this work to be done but we are happy with the end result."
7/7/17,5,Inchcape Audi Macclesfield. Excellent customer service with a smile. Always seem to go that extra mile to help.
7/7/17,5,"I popped in to cooper Thames ditton to have a look at the new Mini Countryman as I already had the previous model , the staff were very friendly and obviously very good at their jobs as iordered a new coopers countryman there & then and am happy to say it was delivered on time to my specifications and am extremely happy to recommend the dealership"
7/7/17,5,"Excellent customer service from start, to finish, and beyond!

Wouldn't use any other dealership now - Cooper Malton excel themselves in delivering the best service and making the deal work for you.

Thanks Carl and the team!"
7/7/17,4,"Good customer service once I had got through to the right person!

The number to ring is a general number. The you are politely put through to the service department. Then you are politely put through to service bookings.

This may be good from your viewpoint, but from the customers
'S view this is very annoying. Please give us numbers that we can call directly."
7/7/17,3,"On the date of this service they forgot to re-set the computer service interval so had to return again in my time and at my cost to have what should be an everyday thing to them reset. Also they made a mess of the service book as far as just filling in a few details. This should be routine to these guys, its not rocket science."
7/7/17,5,"Very helpful and friendly staff
Kept me informed of the progress of the job being carried out and how long it would take !
Explained after, in detail the work that was carried on my car and any further work that needed doing was pointed out

There after care servicing has been so good from giving me a ring to remind me that the service is due and booking my car when its the best time for me and just how I wan to do it picking my car up if needs be even from my place of work.

I ordered my car through the motability scheme, the car was out of the country and needed to be transported to the UK and it was delivered to myself within 2 weeks. The car I ordered was the VW Touran and it is absolutely fabulous and is perfect for our needs.
David Sherwood was really helpful and absolutely nothing was too much trouble.
Got to say I will be going nowhere else in the future to order my car.
See you in 3 years David.

7/6/17,5,"I took my Golf Gti to the bodyshop. It's an older one and, the wings were getting replaced under warranty. I also chose to have the bonnet repainted while I was at it. The work was completed very quickly and, the quality of the paint job was fantastic, a perfect match. I had a couple of issues with the fit of one of the wings but, again, this was rectified and, now, my car looks like new again. I've had some very bad experiences with dealers in the past but, when it comes to the time to upgrade to a newer GTi, I now know where I will be going for it."

I have experience of Mercedes through my father for over 10 years and my father has always been seen by Bryan Chambers. 6 years ago I visited Bryan for my first Mercedes. I am now on my second 66 plate A class AMG.
Bryan Chambers is a credit to your organisation and always ensures the customer is happy. Bryan's friendly attitude and approach to any meeting is a welcomed relaxed touch.
Bryan always ensures your partner is happy with what your wanting to do. And also has a comical, laid back and non pressuring atmosphere.

All I can say is Thank you Inchape and thank you Bryan."

Thankyou"
7/6/17,5,"The team were challenged to find a replacement C class estate, after a few days they offered a choice of 2 cars and matched the finance package also. Well done. Service is outstanding and much better than other Mercedes outlets in this area which my partner used - sure they will change to dealing with Bob Lacer at Mercedes-Benz Leicester. The team at Leicester are attentive, polite, professional in every aspect of customer care."

7/6/17,5,Thank you very much
7/5/17,1,I responded to an advert in Autotrader for a Golf r estate which stated the mileage was 20. I asked for confirmation of this and a video of the car. I received a 17 second video of the dealership sign and the salesman asking me to phone him with nothing about the car at all! I have never seen anything so stupid and am not interested in buying a car from Inchcape Bolton.
7/5/17,5,"Excellent service, collection and delivery service very good and staff are polite and helpful"
7/5/17,3,"Not a great start when I turned up for a test drive & they had forgotten I was coming !
generally ok but few issues with general communications .
Very disappointing handover experience with delivery not going to agreed plan .
Also I was overcharged by a small amount and I asked about my refund & have not had a response as yet
I would not go out of my way to use sandhurst branch again"
7/5/17,5,As always a good experience good polite smiling people helping you to get served
7/4/17,1,"Bought an A3 and felt that because I was not using Audi finance they completely lost interest in me as a customer. I then had to chase them to find out why, 2 weeks after trading in my old car, they had still not paid the settlement figure meaning I occurred additional charges for my old car as well as paying for my new one. Audi managers were very slow to respond, my original sales man completely ignored the email that was sent asking him to get in touch as there was an issue. I was later told by a member of the finance team that as I was a 'cash' customer that they treated the transaction differently and despite there being no reason as to why my settlement hadn't been paid - other than the quote didn't expire until a later date- they were completely unhelpful in ensuring that excess money paid was refunded. It took 4 days for the manager to get in touch and then it was via email as I was unable to answer at 5.30pm 3 days after he was supposed to have. No voicemail was left and no apology has been made and no refund given for the excess money paid. Very poor customer service. If you want to be treated as a valued customer, I'd ensure you were using their own high interest rate Audi finance if I were you..."
7/4/17,5,"Would highly recommend! John was great, I knew mostly what I wanted and he advised me on what would be best, with regards to new or used, finance and cover."
7/4/17,5,"Inchcape Twickenham assistance in buying a nearly new car was second to none. No pushy sales staff , no pressure to buy .They helped me find the car I wanted with the spec I required. Excellent would recommend !"
7/4/17,5,"Audi Tunbridge Wells supplied my Q3 new just over two years ago and the whole process of ordering and liaising with the excellent sales person was a pleasant and stress-free process.

Since then I have had two annual services. Both times the car was collected from my home some 15 miles away and returned at the appointed time. The servicing itself was faultless and I was kept in contact by the service department by phone and video-cam.

All staff have been polite and efficient.
Well done Audi Tunbridge Wells !"
7/4/17,5,"Great customer service
Work was carried out on time and came in under the original estimate.
Advice and guidance provided was valuable to me."

7/1/17,2,"Girl who took my original booking referred to my asking for the 4 wheel drive to be check as hitting my washing machine with a hammer and I would have to pay? On the day all polite and seemed fine but discovered there was a problem with my 4 wheel drive. I asked if it was covered by the extended warranty along with the leaking shock they had discovered before but not told me about when I bought the car from them? I was due to get a call the next day, chase them for the next 3 days, after that with no one returning my call I finally I held for the service manager who just said perhaps they hadn't heard from the VW Warranty, but would get someone Pam to call me back. I did suggest a courtesy call to keep me up to date or at least an acknowledgement would have been helpful? Anyway both jobs are now being done under warranty. I have another year of taking my car to Cheltenham VW because of the extended warranty? Lets hope the experience gets better?"
6/30/17,5,"I have just purchased my first BMW 3 Series from your used car sales from a distance. Sales Executive Eddy, sent me a really professional video which resulted in my buying the car.
Eddy kept me well informed and did everything he possibly could to make the experience of buying a car through BMW enjoyable and relaxed. I received the car yesterday, 29 June 2017 and I wasn't disappointed, positively overwhelmed. Sheer BMW quality.
I am thrilled to bits. Huge thank you to Eddy and many thanks to Stephen who also worked to make the sale a real success. Derek Mulligan"

I am a 'fussy' person and my expectations have always been exceeded.
I wouldn't think of taking my beautiful car anywhere else...............as titled 'excellent as always'!

Thank you!

6/29/17,5,"Took my Polo into Inchcape (Altrincham) at 8.45am, a little late because of heavy traffic - no problem - left it to have Air-Con checked as it did not seem to be operative, was shown to my courtesy car, another even newer Polo - drove out in five minutes. Phone rang later in the day, AC fixed, no charge as car is only 15 months old - drove back short time later, my car fixed, minimal disruption of my day, excellent service from everyone at Inchcape - top class dealers!"
6/29/17,4,Car had its 3 year service and MOT. Inchcape collected the car and I have no issues with the service this time - I was updated on progress and received the usual video report. I've only given 4 stars as the reason they collected the car was the poor service I received on the previous 2 services when their 'wait appointments' took twice as long as advertised and I was not kept informed.
6/27/17,1,"Twickenham VW is not doing well on the service front. I took my Golf Match in on Monday (yesterday) 8am and they didn't even look at it until 5pm. Then, surprise surprise they couldn't complete the investigation (warning light catalytic converter) because their computer system was ""running slow"". By 10am today (Tues) no word from them so I phone AGAIN. It needs a part which of course they don't have but they will get TOMORROW. And they will have the car ready by 5.30pm tomorrow, if they can organise themselves to do so. PATHETIC AND VERY POOR SERVICE"
6/27/17,5,"Professional service from entering the car park to completion of works, payment and exit. All handled nicely and efficiently without over doing it.
Current newspapers, TV and refreshments all offered and freely available.
Car washed and ready to collect on time. Have no doubt about returning for next service."
6/26/17,5,We had a very good experience buying through Cooper Reading everyone was very friendly and helpful. We mainly dealt with Tamara who was excellent and very efficient. The car was ready when they said it would be and we see very happy with our purchase. Would highly recommend.
6/26/17,5,"This company make buying a car as simple as it could possibly be.
Because we live 30 miles from the dealership everything was done online: from choosing the vehicle and colour to filling in all the paperwork.
Carl Baker, the sales executive who looked after us throughout the process, did an excellent job leading up to and including the day we visited the dealership to collect the car.
We would have no hesitation in recommending this business to anyone."
6/24/17,5,"The service received was courteous and efficient. All repairs and servicing were carried out to a high standared and I was notified of any additional work needed before it was carried out. The car was ready on time and was very clean apart from , yet again, a dirty cloth being used for the front and rear screens! -This is only a very minor criticism though of an otherwise trouble-free experience."
6/24/17,5,"Very friendly and helpful staff with an excellent knowledge of the cars. Dennis, the technician who worked on my car was very knowledgeable indeed."
6/24/17,1,"DO NOT BUY A NEW VEHICLE FROM HUNTERS LAND ROVER.
Having been made out to be a liar by both their service manager and head of business over a disputed warranty claim, im now having to take legal action against them to have my vehicle fixed."
6/24/17,5,As much as i like to talk about the car I have just bought 220d M Sport. The bigger picture i would like to highlight is the Manager Laurence who in my eyes is a person of integrity a straightforward man with a guileless smile.The sort of person who helps others from an honest desire to do good.Many thanks to him and most of his team for putting things right.How He has dealt with the few problems with the car says a hell of a lot about Him and the company.Coopers of Chelmsford. Nothing more than Veracious.I have now got my car back with a beaming smile.
6/23/17,5,"We would highly recommend Hunters, no pressure to buy which was a big plus. Everyone from sales was a pleasure to deal with, helpful, pleasant and caring. Even the main sales manager took the time to get an evaluation on our experience something we never got from BMW who we have had BMWs for the last 20 yrs.

Well done Hunters"
6/23/17,5,Hunters Kings Lynn always make you feel that looking after your car is important to them as it is to you. I've yet to meet any of the team who do not make you feel welcome. All being well we only meet once a year but it's like catching up with old friends. I would rate the Service team the best I have ever experienced. Absolutely recommended.
6/23/17,1,"Ridiculous customer care, poor customer service, no resolution, unreasonable response to a car going faulty on numerous occasions, in the garage for plus 14 issues, returned twice with no fuel and the car in the garage for over 30 days. No compensation whatsoever offered!!!"
6/23/17,5,"All staff are friendly and have the knowledge which makes The Norwich branch of H.A Fox Jaguar a pleasure to visit. A young lady called Ella looked after My wife and myself they got on straight away so I knew I would be outnumbered as I needed A Sportbrake for my wifes disability scooter Ella spent a lot of time making sure all was ok for my wife, the only trouble with that was it was decided we would buy the car on the colour and not the car but thats what happens when you get outvoted an excellent job done.
p.s Can I have the bigger engine next time.Just for the extra fun."
6/23/17,4,Good service
6/23/17,5,I am always satisfied with my service with Inchcape vw and my latest experience didn't disappoint
6/23/17,5,"Car service ok no fuss, I was seen within 5 minutes of sitting down, I have been coming to VW for 5-6 years now with no issues, very efficient, excellent service."
6/23/17,5,Good service and flexible
6/22/17,5,"Very straightforward booking and checking in ,I was loaned a courtesy car without any charges. Very friendly service from all the staff that I spoke to. My car was cleaned and they even blacked the tyres. Very pleased that is why I continue to use this company."
6/22/17,5,"Helpful, polite. No quibble courtesy car. Prepared to listen."
6/22/17,5,My car was in for a service and MOT. Inchcape provided me with a taxi to my home and then back to the dealership. The work was carried out efficiently in the time quoted and the staff were very friendly.
6/22/17,5,expensive but excellent service
6/22/17,5,A good experience from beginning to end - especially working with Rachel! Immensely helpful and accommodating.
6/22/17,5,Excellent service from Jack Beeston.
6/21/17,1,"What a rip off....took hilux pickup for a recall repair and a MOT..and left with a £2500 bill, that's half of what I paid for the 2008 pickup,

Change centre brake hose. £789.77
Exhaust blowing centre and rear. £424.62
5 brake hoses(ns,os,fr,bk etc) £919
Propshaft centre rubber. £371.50
1 seat belt. £299.00
Battery connector £54

This is unacceptable, how can innocent hard working people be conned like this by so call reputable garages.....Please check any other garage other than this one, because they are sure to find a problem you never knew you had and charge you an extortionate price for doing so.

These are the people I have to thank for my bill.

6/21/17,1,"What a waste of time this company is in my opinion. Emailed them after seeing car on Autotrader asking if vehicle was available. They replied it was, so I drove over to look at it. I rang to say I'd be there in an hour and was told that's short notice and I may have to wait for someone to deal with me. I got there and was ""greeted"" by an employee who was on a mobile phone and talked to me at the same time!!! Salesman then said the car had been sold - why wasn't I told when I rang????
Don't bother with this company is my advice to anyone thinking of buying a car. There are plenty of other garages out there who can do customer service!!!"
6/21/17,5,Good service and expertise staff.
6/21/17,5,The service I have received from Jaguar whilst going through the process of choosing and purchasing my new car has been excellent. The after sales service has also been just as good. I would thoroughly recommend going there if you are thinking of buying a new car.
6/21/17,5,Excellent service Martin was extreamly helpfull
6/20/17,5,"Initial,contact by email then phone.
Salesman and dealership all incredibly helpful.
Collection of car was great, time at dealership was very hospitable and efficient whilst sorting paperwork.
Phone calls afterwards to ensure no issues.

Very happy customer"
6/20/17,5,"Very friendly and efficient staff. Service and MOT booked, courtesy car provided without any hassle (you just need to forward plan it if you require the courtesy car). Work carried out and a free full valet. Excellent."
6/20/17,5,"A great company to deal with, from first contact to picking up my new Range Rover Sport, Fantastic level of service.

I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a Land Rover."
6/20/17,5,Very good service. Extremely polite and helpful. Car was returned in first class condition
6/19/17,5,"Just recently bought a 330d from Cooper Durham and could not be happier. The car itself is immaculate and has no mechanical/aesthetic faults. The service received from the team, in particular Neil Kent & Tim Barry was spot on. Never pressured into anything, answered any question I had and above all else were friendly and approachable, something that can't be said for other garages. Cheers lads!"
6/19/17,5,Stuart was an impeccable help in picking the right car for me and took me through every step of the way Even after sale
6/19/17,5,Fantastic experience. Great staff. Would definitely use them.again
6/19/17,5,"I bought ""cherished"" A3 just one month ago- it was at another Inchcape dealers and was delivered to Bolton within the notified time-scale. It has the S Tronic DSG 6 speed auto/manual box and drove beautifully.
I did notice after a couple of days that the engine oil had not been changed and the washer fluid was low. I queried this and was advised that the other outlet had completed the 143 item check. The car was booked in and the service was carried out and they also MOT'd the car as gesture of goodwill. A courtesy car was provided.
After it had been returned I decided to polish the car and noticed that the front bumper was a very slightly different shade of red and after reference to the garage they confirmed that this was the case and they have now been repainted it.
I am very happy with the treatment that I have received despite the slight above hicups and can highly recommend them."
6/18/17,5,"Audi really lived up to expectation. After only being in the market for lesser branded cars in previous years, this was my first experience of a more top end brand and the sales experience, the collection of my purchase and of course my car did not disappoint. I totally love my new car, my Audi encounter has been second to none."
6/17/17,5,I bought a used car on lease to replace my old lease car. Very organised process. They kept me updated through out the proceedure. Very quick.
6/17/17,5,"From the initial viewing to the delivery of the car all the staff we were in contact with at Tetbury Audi were excellent.

The sales exec Graham Owen was knowledgeable, polite and courteous.

Many thanks to all."
6/16/17,5,"Had an amazing experience at Swindon audi, all staff were very welcoming and friendly, taking the time to interact with our two young children was lovely and made it a fun experience for them.
Nothing was too much trouble, offering drinks to us all and puzzles to our children.
Was made to feel very at ease and comfortable during the test drive and was shown thoroughly all the features of the car.
Can't recommend swindon audi enough, best service I have ever had from a car dealership.
Look forward to returning in the future!"
6/16/17,5,"Outstanding customer service. Pro-active, attentive and delivered on what they promised with the customer's requirements at the heart of everything they do. Couldn't recommend them more highly."
6/16/17,5,I found a great car and was given a great deal on it backed up by excellent customer service. No need to say any more.
6/16/17,5,"Very pleased with the quality of work and advice given. The service manager is very professional , efficient and helpful in the dealings I had with Bolton Audi"
6/16/17,1,Fantastic service upon leasing our car now 9 months later when we wish to complain regarding locking wheel nuts and issues with removing them we have been waiting nearly five business days for a response despite chasing on numerous occasions. Extremely disappointed.
6/15/17,5,Excellent service from the greeting by name to collection of car. Kept fully informed by text of what was going on and sent a video link by phone of the health check. Staff were friendly and helpful and called a couple of days later to check everything was ok
6/15/17,5,excellent customer service
6/15/17,5,Great service
6/15/17,5,Excellent service and very friendly. They work hard to help you when in need. A few days before my husbands funeral I had problems with my brakes. They pulled out all the stops to fit me in quickly and showed great sympathy during a really difficult time in my life.
6/15/17,5,The service process was seamless. The service was well explained and the short video was very helpful in explaining further work needed. The vehicle was washed and vacuumed as promised and ready for collection on time. Excellent!
6/15/17,5,"Attentive service from Toby and team from start to end for a service on my 18 month old Golf 2.0 diesel. I even received an emailed video tour with the mechanic showing close ups of all the underside components. Yes I was impressed, albeit not cheap."
6/15/17,5,"Friendly, efficient service. Restores my faith in the brand."
6/14/17,5,"Exceptional service from all the staff at Romford, really pleasant experience, thank you 😀"
6/14/17,4,"Great experience! Our sales rep Andrew was brilliant and explained everything to us clearly and so we knew how much everything would be. We've had to come back twice due to a tyre pressure sensor issue (first time they just reset and second time they did a full free health check which found the issue) but to be honest they were quick, helpful and fixed it within 3 days of us raising it. It's not the issues it's how you respond to them and these guys are top notch, exactly what you're paying for."
6/13/17,5,It was all good thanks for that
6/13/17,5,"Excellent service, felt to be a valued customer"
6/13/17,5,"We are delighted with our recent experience buying a car through Hunters Guildford. Having also visited another dealer in the Ascot area we had a direct comparison and have to give Gary at Hunters five stars! He was very well informed, helpful and attentive. He was not pushy or self-focussed which was refreshing. We are not in the market for purchasing cars very often so we are not experienced in negotiation, as another reviewer also mentioned, and agree perhaps we could have got a better deal elsewhere, but we fell under Gary's charm and to his credit we feel none the worse for it! ...and the car? Of course we are absolutely delighted, as Gary assured us we would be :)"
6/13/17,2,"One of the most frustrating experiences.
I found the car by searching the Lexus UK website, located 300 miles away from me. All contact was either by telephone or email.
Over ten days the garage rarely returned telephone calls as agreed and it took four attempts to get the right paperwork from them.
I ordered a low-loader to collect the car. The day before it was due to collect and all monies paid, I still did not have all of the documentation from Inchcape.
The Sales Manager called me to say if they did not have all the paperwork completed he could not allow the car to be released. When I complained that it was the garage which had caused the delay, he told me that I would never be satisfied with what they did; he would therefore arrange to give me my money back. I had ordered and paid for a low-loader, which he was aware of, but clearly this was of no interest to him.
I was forced to take my complaint to Lexus UK Customer Relations. Finally the car was released on schedule."
6/13/17,5,First rate support from Tom Carmen in the Service Dept.
6/12/17,5,I was there to do my emission correction and was served by Mr Henry who explained everything what they gonna do during the job and some special gifts at the finishing.Thank you so much.Great work .
6/12/17,5,"samantha @ nottingham

came in to have a look at a vehicle and she talked me through everything start to finish, made the experience fun and enjoyable would recommend to anyone, even the mechanics said hello as i walked by, great atmosphere in the whole dealership 10/10"
6/12/17,5,"Very friendly and efficiend dealer. I loved the video report of the underside of my car emailed to me after the work was completed. ""Probably the best Volkwagen dealer in the world."""
6/12/17,5,"Had my car serviced at VW Bury, a main dealer I've used for over ten years. Once again I was extremely pleased with their service and the assistance of the service staff."
6/12/17,1,"Took my car there with a fault, they charged me near £400 to fix, then after one week it broke down, I had to pay to be rescued, the callout engineer recognised the issue immediately as did the legit mechanic I took it to afterwards who charged me £50, so for a £50 fault I paid £600/700 thanks to Inchscape in Romford. Now they call/text me everytime my service/MOT is due... obviously I'll never ever take my car back to them."
6/12/17,5,"Helpful, considerate and knowledgeable. No question is too silly. Excellent service that I am very happy with."
6/12/17,5,"Took car in for emissions fiddle to be corrected. Job was completed while I waited, staff were extreme!y helpful and courteous (which is a minimum standard)."
6/12/17,5,Really informative at Romford as there was a slight delay and a nice clean car !
6/12/17,5,"When we purchased our VW Polo the sales staff were excellent, we could not fault the service we received. Would recommend to our friends.
Jason Clark seemed to go the extra mile to give satisfaction"
6/11/17,2,"GUILDFORD Branch. Car went in for a couple of items not working. They did 2 things... 1. Overcharged us greatly on the labour side. Charged for 4.2 hours when only 2 were used. And
2. The so called 'free' video inspection of the underside said in the commentary that there was a substantial leak from the gearbox. Estimated cost £800. When this was checked by an independent engineer it was found to be nothing of the sort.
This branch of HA Fox seems to overcharge and recommend costly and UNNECESSARY work to maximise their revenue

Would only use these people for basic services if at all.

The Following added as a result of input from their head office. We still have a copy of the quite damming video of the inspection. We did receive a refund of the excess labour but without a hint of an apology, or explanation of the 'substantial leak' comment."
6/10/17,3,"Although the service element was satisfactory, I have reservations on the specific elements I asked the service dept to look at (Steering). Hence a 3 star rating."
6/10/17,5,Great team. Top customer care.
6/9/17,5,"superb service with no pressure sales tactics.
sales lady Zelda was amazing and i can't thank her enough in finding my dream car.
if i could give a 10 star rating i would and after being a Lexus driver for over 3 years i feel i'm more than justified in saying this.
not that it matters but i am also a sales manager for over 20 years so know i good sales lady when i meet one.
i am and always will be a loyal Lexus driver.
thank you for giving me total driving enjoyment."
6/9/17,5,"As usual everyone very helpful, friendly and informative. Car had its first MOT the only problem was with the car reg, it was mixed up but soon sorted. Thank you very much Inchcape."
6/8/17,5,Love my new polo GTI and champagne I got with the car! They made it easy to trade my old car in and buy my great new GTI the only hot hatch to have! Cheers to VW Colchester
6/8/17,5,Efficient and friendly service
6/8/17,1,"I have been irritated by excessive efforts to sell additional services before service , at booking in and after service and multiple follow up calls and mails about the quality of experience.This has been a feature of my dealings and clearly demonstrates a very pushy sales policy which pushes me away. The introduction of fees for courtesy cars is more of the same. I was also advised that my emissions corrective work would be fine with the service but the same garage had done this work two months previously; a sign of incompetence and not how a damaged brand should rebuild confidence"
6/8/17,5,We always have a good experience when we deal with Inchcape. Nothing is too much trouble and we never feel unwelcome.
6/8/17,5,"My car was scheduled for a minor service and an MOT. The service staff were helpful and friendly, arranging a courtesy lift for myself to home, and later in the afternoon collecting me at home to return to the garage. The service included a visual inspection, with a video recording of the inspection posted for me on line. After servicing and MOT the vehicle had been valeted inside and out with an included air freshener. As in the past, I am very happy with the service provided by Mann Egerton."
6/8/17,5,first class service in every way. Very knowledgeable and helpful sales staff who really deserve to succeed.
6/8/17,5,The sales executive was very professional and helpful during and after the purchase process. I was very pleased with the deal and the way it was achieved.
6/7/17,5,"My third car from Cooper York, as usual I am treated like a valued customer, Tim Green always makes me feel comfortable, and there's a good deal to be had too. He even took me home once, in his M3, when I was in a hurry to get to work. It goes without saying, the cars are amazing, more affordable than people think too."
6/7/17,5,"My 13 year old A2 car was picked up and serviced, MOT'd, cleaned and returned on the same day.

During the inspection a couple of future potential problems were discovered, (damaged track rod end boot and bent wheel rim) and mentioned.

Whilst the car is on the hoist the problems were videoed and sent to my mobile; enabling me to physically see the problems and quickly decide what to do about them.

Ultimately, Maidstone Audi have serviced my car from 1 year old; if they weren't competent and fair I wouldn't continue to use them."
6/7/17,5,"From the booking, to the sign in proceess, the welcome, the courtesy car, the actual service, the car wash and the invoicing- all was done with professional high quality. Best car service service I've ever had. Makes me happy to own a BMW- why would I go anywhere else?"
6/7/17,5,Excellent customer service!
6/7/17,5,"Sales staff extremely helpful (especially as I was travelling a large distance to view the car....thanks Jonathan). Car features well demonstrated at handover, inc showing how to use the sat nav to get me out of Stockport.
Based on my experience, I would certainly recommend Stockport Audi."
6/7/17,1,"They forgot to collect my car, finally turned up after I had called them, made me late for work !!
After a full service I was told I needed two new rear tyres as the originals were badly worn, split, I left a message for them to get back to, they did not get back, instead they sent the car back with what I had been told were illegal tyres. They also forgot to stamp the service book, therefore I have now got to make a 30 mile round trip to have it stamped.
When I took the car to another dealer to have new tyres put on, they the other dealers were quite surprised it had just come back from a free service as it was clear to them the rear wheels had not been removed for some time, my question is how did Inchape manage to carry out a full service and check brake wear without taking the rear wheels off.
My advice is great car very poor service STEER WELL CLEAR OF THESE COWBOYS."
6/7/17,5,"My whole experience with Lexus Nottingam was pleasant and unrushed.

I was treated with respect by Andrew the friendly but professional salesperson."
6/7/17,5,"Booked for a while you wait service and car was ready at the agreed time. Friendly and efficient staff and taken to car when ready to leave.

6/7/17,5,"I had my s line a6 serviced by Maidstone Audi and as usual the service and attention to detail was excellent, all the staff are happy to help in any way and nothing is to much trouble, and the service price was very competitive."
6/7/17,5,Excellent service.
6/7/17,4,"Very good experience at Shrewsbury , the only down fall was I cheekily asked for a free fleece to be told you cant get them anymore ( even though there was one in the show room for sale ) but I was told I could have a key ring which I never had . When spending £31,000 for a car I am sure a key ring is a drop in the ocean"
6/7/17,5,Delivery of new car today. Seamless trouble free and very pleasant man making the delivery. If only other companies could match this service.
6/7/17,3,"Usually, I have not been able to fault this dealer. From initial purchase to servicing, and interim visits, everything has been flawless, with exceptional customer service.

At my last service, I had specifically asked for some minor damage to the off-side front wing of my car to be looked at. This was totally overlooked, and nothing was done about it. I was going to raise it at the time, but the customer service agent who had dealt with my car, was not available when I collected my car.

As it is not currently a major concern, I let it go on this occasion, but I was very disappointed, and not a little surprised."
6/7/17,5,First class experience throughout - Well done Cooper BMW!
6/7/17,5,From the minute we walked into the showroom 3 years ago to date we have nothing but praise for the staff and service we have experienced from Inchape Audi - so much so that we've just ordered our next new car!
6/7/17,5,The staff were very good and the work was carried out on estimate and on time
6/7/17,1,"A3 1.4 TFSI bought from the dealer with 35k miles on it. Full Audi service history and as it had a service pack, this continued afterwards until the day it died. 7 months out of warranty at 51k, the gearbox went (manual box). This is not something you would expect from a car with this low mileage and from this brand but things like this can happen.

What however is not acceptable, is that the dealer has no interest in the issue and just expects the customer to pay £6k to fix it. Only if you pay a £1k investigation charge (non refundable), they would put in a request for an Audi contribution towards the total cost (not guaranteed). But the service manager would call back the next day as well as the used car manager to discuss possible solutions. Neither called back (ever) which is where the unreasonable conduct comes into play.

You don't leave a customer with a proposed £6k bill, and then never contact them to discuss how to solve it. It dented the faith into the dealership beyond recovery and it is a rather poor advertisement for the dealer itself. The car has been sold now with a £2k loss of value due to the issue, which is still better than any result that I could have achieved with Audi themselves.

I am not sorry to not have to deal with that dealer again though, as the customer service level is poor in general, the waiting times at reception just to drop your car off for a service are unacceptable and the same is the case again with picking it up again."
6/7/17,5,"Small blip on collection of car but overall every thing you would expect from a Mercedes dealership. The sales Representative (Bryan Chambers) was fantastic, I'd recommend anyone to see him first ."
6/7/17,5,"I purchased my XF from HA Fox at Leeds in 2013 and had it serviced by them every year until 2016 when they changed ownership. The service from HA Fox was excellent, however, unfortunately my service was booked in the week of the change over in 2016 and after travelling around 70 miles with my vehicle I was told that the database hadn't been changed over and my car was not booked in which meant another visit. Due to this I went to HA Fox at York this year for the service. This is also about half the distance for me as travelling to Leeds. Same excellent service and car returned cleaned inside and out. Only observation was that the boot wasn't vacuumed, but no problem. Looking at changing vehicle this year so will probably be going to York again."
6/7/17,5,An all around 5* service when I bought my new car from Coopers Reading recently. Very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Really nice modern showroom. All around faultless sales service.
6/7/17,5,Excellent in all aspects
6/7/17,5,"I researched VW CC's within 60 miles & then nationally on Autotrader.
The car I bought was great value compared to others. The dealer gave me a fair part exchange price and I drove the car away within a couple of hours of entering the dealership.
The car was prepared to Das Welt standards and has been fault free so far."
6/7/17,4,Helpful in getting me the pre registered car I wanted but disappointed they dragged their feet in sending of the car details to DVLA to enable me to register my cherished plate in the time frame I asked and also the petrol tank was empty and just about made it to the petrol station
6/7/17,5,"Fantastic service, salesman Micheal was very good at explaining everything and wasn't pushy at all which is great when purchasing something like this! Handover of car was brilliant and follow up after the car was a really nice touch."
6/7/17,3,"Overpriced servicing compared to other local main dealers. Quality of ""valet"" shockingly poor. Very limited loan car availability."
6/7/17,5,"Fantastic service - great people, very helpful"
6/7/17,2,"I booked my car into North Wales Mercedes on line. I was asked if I wished to take advantage of a test drive while I waited. I did, because I am in the market for a new car.

On arrival the customer service area was spotless as usual and staff were courteous and polite. I handed my keys over. I expected it to take about 75 minutes, as this is what the website advertised. I was kept waiting nearly 3 hours and told there was a minor problem but they couldn't firmly identify it unless I paid them to investigate further. I declined. I felt that I should be told specifics rather than being asked to pay for them to tell me.

I asked about the test drive, but none was forthcoming, neither was there an apology or even an explanation. He did offer to try and arrange a test drive, but after waiting for twice as long as I anticipated, I concluded the sales staff were not seeking new business.

I washed and polished the car myself the day before it went in and it was spotless, however after a wash, the rear of the car was quite dirty and needed to be washed again. I have learnt to tell them not to wash the car in future.

I felt there was an excellent facade on view to the public, but my experience was less than average. I don't anticipate I will have my next service at North Wales Mercedes, Llandudno Junction again.

I felt also that the pricing of an 'A' service was too much. I have come from there with a puzzle (what exactly did they suspect that they found), an oil change and filter and an entry in the service record. Very little really for nearly £200. I fully appreciate that the pricing structure is that of MB and not North Wales Mercedes."
6/7/17,5,very good service without any hassle glad that everyone listens to you recomend to others
6/7/17,5,Land Rover Discovery Sport 1st service & a couple of minor issues all sorted.
6/7/17,5,The moment you walk through the doors at the Inchcape VW dealership you will be impressed by the atmosphere of quality efficiency and professionalism. This is also reflected in the cars they sell and the friendly helpful staff. The care and attention they give to keeping the customer satisfaction comes across as being genuine and is first class. I bought a Polo there last year and have recently had it serviced. So far I am very pleased with the service I have received. A big thank you to everyone there I have dealt with.
6/7/17,5,Very impressed with the new showroom. I had a service on my vehicle. Staff were very helpful and efficient. Will definitely return again for my next service
6/7/17,5,"I can't speak highly enough about this dealership.
I was with another group who overcharged and tha car always came back with an issue."
6/7/17,5,"I was reminded 2 days before and asked if anything changed which it had in the fact of now needing a hire car.
Excellent responce .Car was finished on time after a call from Foxs kept me informed.
Car was ready and fully valeted for me.
Gabrielle on the workshop reception was especially good in sorting these issues."
6/7/17,5,"Very good experience and first change of dealership since my ""S"" registered BMW 3 series many years ago..."
6/7/17,5,"Very friendly, efficient service with enough time to make sure you get the vehicle you require."
6/7/17,5,"They did the job I asked them to do, for the price that they quoted me, within the time they estimated. Perfect."
6/7/17,5,Great service as always
6/6/17,5,they also helpful and they understand and they care about the person that's what I think so special
6/5/17,5,A good experience.
6/5/17,2,Had a servo pipe installed after a diagnostic. Drove the car home and it sounded different. Car wouldn't start the next day and the exhaust is now blowing out. Inchcape's advice was to drive down so they could look at it. I reminded couldn't get it started. I told them I had asked a local mechanic to look at it and they seemed happy enough with that and haven't bothered calling back.
6/5/17,2,Always frustratingly poor. No disrespect to individuals but they just don't employ staff that understand how busy customers want to be treated.
6/5/17,3,"The Service Advisor was excellent. However the service needs attention. I was not made aware of the progress of the repairs. I had to phone in. The alternate transport to fetch me was 1.5 hrs late. The initial booking conversation and on the day conversation deferred a bit. the car was supposed to be cleaned, which they did, but a poor job though."
6/5/17,5,Andy was exceptional kept us informed great customer service. very impressed.
6/4/17,1,"Do not buy from here. Terrible company, sold me a top of the range ex demonstrator, lied about registering the vehicle, took 4 months, yes 4 months to sort out. Told me this was a minor inconvenience and eventually said I could progress the complaint through an ombudsman they are not even a member of for vehicle sales.!! And that was from the company secretary. Volkswagen need to review their franchise with shoddy businesses like this."
6/2/17,5,the staff were very friendy and knowledgeable well done see you again
6/2/17,5,Great service from arrival to collecting the car from service. Highly recommended and go the extra mile
6/2/17,1,"Terrible service, booked our car in for a diagnostic and service. When we took the car in we mentioned a possible problem with the steering rack, after waiting days and chasing twice the finally called to say they too thought the issue may be the steering rack too but would not be able to proceed any further due to the age of the car.

I conveyed that they knew the age of the car when booking it in, but we still got charged for an investigation that got us no further and costs for not having a car for over 5 days.

Terrible service and poor communication"
6/1/17,5,Very happy with service we received from start to finish of our purchase. Really liked personal video of the car we were interested especially as we lived over 50 miles away.
6/1/17,5,"I've just had an excellent buying exprience, probably the best I've ever when purchasing a car. Luca was very helpful in talking me through the car's features and took me out for a lenghty test drive. The actual handover of the vehicle was also excellent - rather than just taking the money and running, Luca spent a lot of time to explain how all the various technical functions worked which was much appreciated. Very professional service and would highly recommend."
5/31/17,5,"I went in to ask about Range Rovers and 3 hours later I had bought one!
The salesman , Gary, was clearly skilled at his job!! In fairness he was so very helpful and knew his product extremely well. I am rubbish at negotiation and soft meat to a professional, but nevertheless, left feeing the deal was fair and I was happy with the outcome. I'm sure others do a better deal with the finances purchasing a new car but I cannot fault the treatment I had with this dealership."
5/31/17,1,"I do not think I could have possibly had a worse experience with a car dealership, 1 star is too many! HA Fox Jaguar Guildford are tarnishing the HA Fox Jaguar group name with their complete and utter lack of interest in making buying your dream car a special event. They offered me a terrible trade in rate in comparison to other HA Fox Jaguars and they wouldn't come down from 10.9% APR whereas the other dealerships could do 6.9%. On top of that I felt like I was always chasing to buy the car rather than them trying to sell it to me e.g. I very rarely got a phone call back when they said they were going to! To sum up I would not advice wasting your money with this place when other dealerships in the group such as Chester and York are offering so much more!! They were also much friendlier and actually seamed to care about my experience as a buyer."
5/29/17,1,Price changed after I'd first been and and agreed everything. Constantly had to chase the salesman for replies. Customer service not great.
5/29/17,2,"My visit to Cooper BMW Malton was not to the standard I expected from a BMW dealership .
I requested a test drive over the phone and wasn't offered one when I attended the site ,the lastest publishd offered were unknown to the sales person Max , which I had to prove by showing him the cooper bmw website !

On positive side the showroom was immaculate and well laid out ,the receptionist was very professional and polite ,and if she had been on the sales team I would have purchased a vehicle that day.

I wasn't offered a business card and felt that this new salesperson was not trained enough in customer relations ,it shows in the showroom lack of customers, As I felt I had invaded the space instead of being treated like a valued customer.
.In comparison Grimsby were opposite ends of the planet to this dealership and I felt a valued customer and I will be purchasing a car from them instead ,even though it's more expensive as my experience is also important to me ,I dress down but expect to be treated the same in any environment."
5/27/17,5,"Better than Marriott group in Ipswich, Ipswich Vw will do everything to rip you off, in my last 64 plate polo, my high fuel pressure failed and when I took it to Vw in Ipswich, after their investigation they comeback to me with 31 new parts worth of £4,167.72 excluding labour.when I asked how come a 64 plate car can cost that much to repair, he said we need to change whole fuel system, and when I said no thank you I better to leave it, with the current mileage on my car it's not even worth that much, as soon as I said that, geuss what he did, he put the phone down, do you know why, just because I didn't wanted to pay that money to his bosses. I was very angry and very pis off with him, I went to Vw Ipswich to see him to have a massive argument, when I asked reception to call him, she gave name, she turnaround and said of sorry his out this afternoon, I was like WHATTTTTTTT, I just talk to him 10 minutes ago. Anyway, I went to service desk and asked my keys, they knew that I was very p off, they didn't even asked me to pay for anything, well I was not going to pay because my car was sitting on their delivery area for 4 days. And then I tow my car from the branch to my house with my friend, I already brought a used high fuel pressure pump from a Car braker for £322, that's why dealer didn't like it and told me that may be the used part youve got is not working, just because he couldn't charged me over a thousand pounds for a new high fuel pressure pump. 2 days later my mechanics friend pulled outside mine and with in 20 minutes he managed the start the car with just 1 used part I brought. My mate saved me over £5k-£6k. Ohh by the way I was forgot to mention his name, his a top service manager RICHARD in Ipswich, you may wanted to unless you wanted to get ripped off. Just because of that experienced I even told the lady who served me at inchcape in Colchester that this will be my last Vw since 2005, which was my 6th vehicle since I start using vw's and I'll be going to get a better deal behalf of my company to buy cars from Peugeot or ford for better customer service. At the end of the day 21 Vw's we use in our company. Thats why I travel from my home town Ipswich to Colchester to get my service done, so 5 star rating for their quality customer service."
5/27/17,1,"Complained previously (See below 03/05/2017) about the non existent after sales service from this outfit. Received an immediate response from Kristi Good stating she would arrange for someone to call to resolve my issues. Did someone call ? Err...... no they didn't. So my message to Kristi is -- If YOU cannot get your colleagues to respond to complaints, how do you expect a customer to get resolution ? If any potential customers of HA Fox Derby are reading this, just be aware that once they have your money, they're not interested and the fact that they completely ignore you after the sale has completed is downright rude ! What a dreadful company."
5/25/17,5,"Over the past 40 years I have purchased many cars. The sales service I experienced at Inchcape was the best I have had anywhere. The sales representative Syed Ali was extremely professional and helpful. I was kept informed of the new car status at all times, and had a video viewing once the car had arrived at the dealership prior to delivery to myself. I would definitely retuurn to Syed and recommend the service to anyone."
5/25/17,5,A great team at Romford
5/25/17,5,"I booked my service via the VW app which I found very useful.
The service advisor was very polite and efficient and kept me up to date with the progress. I also was sent a video of my car having its service which I thought was a great idea!!
Car was ready on time and valeted.
Thank you VW Romford"
5/25/17,5,"A good experience. Everything went to time and smoothly, as expected!"
5/24/17,5,Superb service bought a car from them got a genuine good deal.
5/24/17,5,Booking simple and appear efficient
5/24/17,1,You'll regret If you buy a Jaguar form HAFox.
5/22/17,5,"From booking the car in, to collect after work being carried, everyone was very polite and helpful, fully explaining what was going to be done and the job was completed well within the time stated. Would recommend Inchcape Colchester."
5/22/17,5,Very helpful no pressure and friendly service start to finish
5/22/17,5,"From the moment I walked into the dealership until I got my car back a few hours later I had a very good experience. All the staff were really friendly (including the poor cleaner who had just mopped the floor that I pushed a buggy across) and I was dealt with quickly. There were a few minor jobs suggested on the report that I wasn't pushed into resolving then. The guy I dealt with on the service team advised me of a deal to pre-pay for future services to lock-in a better price, should they change in the future."
5/22/17,2,"Awful review of my car , stuff I asked about once on warranty I was told not to be a problem and now my warranty is up apparently there's something wrong with my car ?! I can't complain about a free wash and vacuum but the floor mats came back dirtier than what I gave them too , felt like my car wasn't really looked after properly now it's out of warranty."
5/19/17,5,Excellent experience!! I had a problem with my XF where the smart keys malfunctioned. I didn't buy the car from H A Fox and this happened 200 miles away from home near Preston. Ryan at the Preston dealership was fantastic and resolved the problem for me as soon as was possible. I was very impressed with the service and the care I was given. My customer experience was excellent. Andy Saxon-Lamb.
5/18/17,5,"Excellent customer service at Maidstone Audi, thank you to Andi who looked after me through the purchasing process and after care. A great experience from a main dealer. Well done Audi !"
5/18/17,3,"Initially tried to book a collection and delivery but told not available until June. Subsequently delivered car and keys on a Sunday for a Monday service but was told that the car would be left on the forecourt overnight, not locked away in the compound so I declined. Booked a collection and delivery for May 15th, collected late morning, service and complimentary wash fine, but delivered back with NSR window partially open and no longer operating. Customer advisor says they'll take a look if I bring it in but it's just an unfortunately coincidence. The car is still as it was left on the drive, and not moved.

Getting hold of the service department is difficult, often resulting in being transferred to central bookings."
5/18/17,5,"Buying a car from Audi Gee Cross, Hyde was easy. Scott and the team were both friendly and professional - and made the whole process of buying my Audi a stress free experience. Great to do business with!"
5/18/17,1,"Incorrect Pricing at Norwich Branch
I was looking to buy a car from them via CarWow. Unfortunately they decided that the published price was incorrect and offered me the vehicle at a much higher price. The excuse was that the website had somehow had the wrong price put on.
Yes they are under no legal obligation to honour the price but initially there was just a "" the price is wrong if you want the car this is what the cost will be"". I did get an apology later but after I had requested details of their complaints procedure they refused to enter any further communication with me. Surely they must at least have a complaints process in place.

Terrible service"
5/18/17,5,VERY GOOD. I AM VERY PLEASED
5/18/17,5,The whole experience from initially looking around to signing the contract was a pleasure! The sales team were certainly not pushy and wanted to help get the best deal. The showroom is lovely and inviting and the staff are great. Very professional service and I would highly recommend.
5/17/17,5,"I could not fault the service provided by the sales team including Justin Watts.
If i had to be critical, i bought a 6 month old staff used car.
It had been valeted, however toys, sweet and wrappers were still under the seats.
Service is attention to detail."
5/17/17,5,"Fast, efficient and effective service. I mentioned that one or two other services (aircon refresh, about to do a very long car journey) and parts (light bulb set) were cheaper elsewhere, and they matched them without hesitation."
5/17/17,5,"Service second to none. Darren Ballard went above and beyond to make sure that we were well looked after. The most pleasurable experience I've had buying a car, and made the 900 mile round trip worthwhile"
5/17/17,5,Brilliant level of service from start to finish.
5/17/17,1,"My husband and I viewed a X1 XDRIVE 201XLine used car on Monday 15th May we had a test drive and said that we liked the car but needed to think it over until the next morning. I duly rang the next morning spoke to the manager, sale agreed deposit paid and I was thanked for purchasing from Coopers of Ipswich I was told that Julien the salesman would be in touch to discuss full payment and when we could pick car up as it needed an MOT .My husband and I took turns waiting for the call, which came after lunch , Julien said that it had all gone through and we could pay electronically when we picked the car up Thursday 18th May , I meanwhile had gone to the town and spent a lot of time queueing in Barclays bank and Saffron building society transferring funds as Coopers would not except a bankers order or Building society cheque , when I arrived home my husband had had another phone call from a manager at the branch to say the car had already been sold the evening before !!subject to the finance being arranged and he hoped that we had not sold our existing car, and they would ring later in the afternoon or next morning to speak to us ,we are still waiting for that phone call . We feel very upset at this appalling treatment ,I have not used this branch before and it was very chaotic, we were kept waiting around for ages to see the car, although when I checked the car was still available on the Monday morning they did offer to bring it to our home around lunch time as we live in Frinton but we thought it better to go to the branch where there was no sign of said vehicle We were also told it was new in ?and we were lucky to be the first to view it, that's why it wasn't on the forecourt . I have just rung the branch and the receptionist cannot find a member of management to speak to us ."
5/17/17,1,"Inchape Stockport didn't have a courtesy car as promised, only fitted one wiper blade when a full set was requested, and didn't alter the service interval as requested. Invoice was confusing and I had to ring back twice for an explanation as a promised return call never happened."
5/17/17,5,"Car went in for a major service my experience was excellent from the moment i arrived , so well looked after by Chris Welch , he updated me every step of the way i was even sent a video of the health check and any fault findings which was my front brake pads , All taken car of no problem , Vw even waivered the cost of a hire car for the day too very impressed by the excellent customer care given from this main dealership 5 stars from me .

Thank you"
5/17/17,5,"Very good service, as ever! Free checkup and cleaning, took time to change tyre too."
5/17/17,5,Visiting this branch was made easy by the very friendly professional staff. Good stock of vehicles and staff who will everything they can to help with a smile. Came away with a great deal on a new car after a very easy exchange.
5/17/17,5,I've been going to Twickenham VW for years. The sales people are professional and knowledgeable and the service side very helpful. Highly recommend.
5/16/17,5,"By far the best experience I've ever had buying a car. The salesman, Mohammed, was fantastic. Friendly polite, explained everything and didn't rush me into a decision. I cannot express how happy I am with the service. All my future cars will be coming from Inchcape Audi Maidstone."
5/16/17,2,"Hi
Told by salesperson that as I was shopping around he felt it was not in his interest to help me any further. He said "" there is no beniefit to me to help you"". That's honest and reveals real view of car salesmen. They say here to help you but in it purely for themselves and get cross when you try to get a deal.
"" there's no advantage to us so why help you"" - then he hung up.

That's appalling service and surprisingly poor as often I've had good service but to be told there is no advantage to them .

Avoid ipswich mini - should change advert to say "" we are here to help ourselves to make money and if we can't make money from you it's not worth helping you so go away"" - that's basically it. I've written to mini to complain but no reply


Updated June - I get emails and mail saying you must ring for offers and you are eligible for savings etc . I've asked them to stop contacting me as anytime I have called I'm told nothing they can offer me despite contacting me after I've asked not too

The salesmen I've met are angry and rude in general.

The staff on the desk of services are good in general"
5/16/17,5,Excellent customer service with first rate luxury cars
5/16/17,5,"Very good service in a pleasant location. Adam our sales rep was professional and knowledgeable. We got the car we wanted, the whole process was quick and easy."
5/16/17,5,"All the staff I have met to date were very friendly and helpful.
The overall impression is of a personal dealership unlike some I know---."
5/16/17,5,"Extremely helpful sales team, reception staff very friendly and fed us with refreshments. Highly recommended."
5/16/17,2,"Took an old-ish car for service on their older car service scheme. Always been maintained by main dealer throughout 10 years. Service book was left on passenger seat and service team was informed that it is there for stamping.
Collected car later and when I got home I noticed that the book was not stamped.
Received a follow up survey from Mercedes and in there stated that I wanted the dealer to contact me so I could arrange to get the book stamped. Auto response said I would but I never received contact.
Then I received another stating that following the dealer's contact, they hoped my matter was resolved. I did not receive any contact from the dealer and the matter is not resolved.
Not really that bothered about the book being stamped and would have left it at that as I have the receipt for the work however incessant follow up surveys and emails which are ignored and fudged by the dealer have prompted this low score review. What a waste of my time asking for feedback then not bothering with even a phone call to tell me they will stamp in the next time I am in."
5/16/17,5,Excellent service when buying my car. Very kind and welcoming as soon as I arrived after a fairly long journey. Immediately given a coffee and made comfortable. My sales manager was efficient and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for him. I left feeling that I had experienced really being looked after. I would not hesitate to recommend Inchcape Exeter.
5/16/17,5,Excellent service
5/15/17,4,Could not hear any of video.
5/15/17,5,"Always a good experience when dealing with the Loughborough dealership. Very welcoming and friendlyand grateful for your buisiness.
Always detail the work carried out, never had any problems."
5/15/17,5,Extremely helpful from the moment I walked through the door. Clear explanations of everything at every step of the process while buying my car. No issues and couldn't do enough for me. Have already recommended Swindon Audi to a friend of mine who has since bought a car from them aswell. Will definitely be going back there when I'm ready to change this car in a couple of years time
5/15/17,5,Excellent professional customer service from the team! Definitely one of the reasons why I am a VW customer @ Inchcape Romford
5/15/17,5,Very good service
5/15/17,5,"From the moment my friend and I arrived at Inchcape Toyota to do a Test Drive, we were made very welcome. A lovely, friendly lady took good care of us whilst we waited for a salesperson to come to organise the test drive. Oliver, our salesman was excellent, patient and very knowledgeable."
5/13/17,5,"Whole purchasing experience was wonderful from first visit to collecting car, everything explained and demonstrated in a competent way, with interest taken in our needs. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
5/13/17,5,Always a great service. The collect and deliver option is excellent for me as I can arrange to work from home for the day and don't need to mess around with courtesy cars.
5/13/17,5,"Prompt.
Particular.
Caring.
Welcoming.
Efficient.
Satisfying."
5/12/17,5,"always professional and friendly. Work done on time, car returned clean, normally valeted. Prices acceptable."
5/11/17,2,"As Audi owners for the last 15 years we were hoping for a positive experience from purchasing a used Audi from Inchcape in Tunbridge Wells. Unfortunately 3 months from our date of purchase in February 2017 we're left feeling dissapointed by the very poor after sales service we have received.

We have been mislead by sales staff on the age and quality of the tyres left on the vehicle even when we pointed out the tread seemed minimal and had seen the report which recommended replacement. In fact the wheels were just swapped round. We have also only now had an issue rectified with the finish on the alloys which has taken three months of us continuously chasing staff to organise collection and repair. However this repair has come back still with issues!

The problems seem to stem from excessive staff turnover and reorganisation. Every time we called the manager had either left or moved department so we had to constantly explain the issue. We were always promised a call back which rarely materialised.

We have two free services to use and we will not be using Inchcape Tunbridge Wells. We will also not be looking for our next vehicle there either."
5/11/17,5,Excellent all round servicre
5/11/17,1,"Never Deal with this Garage.
Jovino the salesman tried his best but with a sales manager like Joe Scott behind him he stands no chance.
I went to pick my new car up and found it had been damaged!!!. Joe agreed to sort the damage out and look after us. I returned the car to them (I live 60 miles away from the garage) a couple of week later and the damage was fixed, When I collected the car (£50 in train fares later) the damage had been fixed but the car was filthy dirty and no compensation!! surprise, surprise Joe was no where to be found. When I finally speak with Joe about some compensation his offer was a tank of fuel (£60). completely insulting.
Plenty more good garages around keep away from this one."
5/10/17,5,I considered the Team at Cooper Malton Mini to be very friendly and extremely helpful both while testing various vehicles and through to the purchasing of my New Countryman. On current experience I have no hesitation in recommending this Company and feel certain that the same level of help and assistance will continue throughout the ownership of my New Car.
5/10/17,5,Special thank you to Henry Dudzik for excellent service!
5/10/17,5,"My service agent was Billy I explained I needed
My vehicle back by 5pm and every effort was made and met, my car was ready before 5pm despite having additional work being needing to be done to the vehicle.
He kept me in the loop throughout the duration of the day. Whole process from start to finish was smooth and simple.
Exceptional service staff keep it up Billy"
5/10/17,1,"I have been using the west london service station for he last 5 years so this experience was understandably a shock to me.
I booked the car in and had requested for a minor service and a roof service for the convertible roof.
There was also a minor irritation with the right door control panel (which had been replaced in the previous servicing earlier last year hence still in warranty).
The information about servicing was well managed and I got hourly updates on the progress.
However When I came to collect the car I found that the right door control panel was still unattended.
I raised the issue with my servicin manager who was profusely apologetic and promised to have the car booked in again and correct what issue. He also mentioned that it would be free of charge as it might still be covered by the warranty.
However this never happened. I am still waiting for his email and inspire of my repeated reminders, it doesn't seem to be a priority for them at all.
Further adding to my misery, the perfectly working roof stopped working 1 day after the servicing and I am now driving around in the few days of summer with the roof locked down.

Extremely disappointed!!!"
5/10/17,2,"Disgusted!
Bought my first XF some 9 years ago then the 2nd XF and lastly my F type 4 years ago all from this dealer and have also always had my services carried out with them. Took my F type to them to get an offer as the salesman said they are short of F types - despite the history of buying 3 cars from them and the condition being better than very good and low mileage - they offered LESS than we buy any car and Evans Halshaw. I was amazed!! Well maybe not so much amazed - prior to the launch of the F type 4 years ago I mentioned to the dealer that I was really interested in this new F type - could they let me know as soon as they landed. Did they...no! I wondered into the showroom one day and saw the car...mentioned to the salesman about my intertest only to find out that they had an open day featuring the F type and nobody bothered to let me know! I should have known better but I still bought the car from them. It's also interesting to note that although I have had no prior dealings with another dealer I have just sold my F type to Farnell of Bolton who gave me £5,000.00 more than H.A Fox offered! Straight purchase without buying from them - Farnell have been great. I know which dealer I would buy a Jaguar from next time. To top it all Farnell needed the online service history (carried out by H.A Fox) and imagine my surprise to find out this week that H.A Fox have never entered online any of the service details since I bought the casr from them!"
5/9/17,1,"Inchape coventry

Took my vehicle in for an issue with the steering . After kwik fit advised there was an issue. Inchape advised that kwik fit had removed the wheels I rebuffed this as the workshop is fully monitored by cctv. I told Helen this is not true. I have issued 5 emails and surprise surprise still no reply. It took 9 phone calls to arrange collection. After calling the the service centre they will call you back very untrue . I have now made a formal complaint to gary savage ceo of Mercedes-Benz uk. About the shocking treatment . I would not recommend this garage for any aftersales. Mercedes-Benz have now taken my vehicle to carry out my concerns. With the steering.. once again I'm accussed of having someone tamper with vehicle Mercedes-Benz will not accept they are the only garage that has worked on the car. The independent assessor has now conducted the inspection on weds 17th may. Surprise surprise inchape are now saying we think it's the tryes. We shall wait and see what the independent assessment states. Before I log any further feedback"
5/9/17,2,Service itself was fine but I wasn't over the moon when they tried to 'sell' me an £80 air con service that they advise you do every 2 years & that is had done the year before...at that same garage. Basically I felt they were trying to pull a fast one - something I expect of a standalone grease monkey but not an approved dealer where you pay a premium for honesty.
5/9/17,5,All work completed satisfactorily and on schedule. Car valeted on completion. Excellent service as usual.
5/9/17,5,Good first service and customer care
5/6/17,5,Great to deal with
5/5/17,5,"Very pleasant, efficient and smiley staff. Car handed back looking like a new one straight from the showroom."
5/5/17,5,"Outstanding customer service. Pro-active, attentive and delivered on what they promised with the customer's requirements at the heart of everything they do. Couldn't recommend them more highly!"
5/5/17,5,"I purchased a new BMW 2 series Gran Tourer from Cooper's. The salesman, Chris, was brilliant, friendly and guided me through the whole process. From initially walking through the door and being offered tea, coffee and biscuits, through to driving out several weeks later (but earlier than expected) with the new car, the staff clearly want their customers to feel at home, and enjoy the experience."
5/4/17,1,"The intial process was fairl okay. I could not find anyone that could explain to me why an interest rate of 10.9% was not 10.9%. It all went prerry bad when it was time to collect the car. It has scratches that I was told would be sorted. It was not cleaned properly and still stinks. I complained to a very rude manager.
I am still waiting for someone to get back to me. The car also needes a good clean. This did not happen sorted as promised. I was also given the wrong service book and sold scratch insurance. The rude manager informed me that a used car will have scratches. Why sell the scratch insurance?
I would never recommend this company to anyone. I have sent several emails. I have had a call back and have now waited over a week for the manager of the manager to investigate. I have been chasing them up as they are not very good at replying to phone calls or emails."
5/4/17,5,"Brilliant customer service!! No fuss no hassle.
I would like to particularly mention a young lady that looked after me when I brought my car in for it's service. Her name was Natasha.
She is polite professional kind and caring totally knows what she's doing and just fills you with confidence!
She made a difference!
amazing customer service. Total asset to your company! Well done Natasha!"
5/4/17,5,"Travelled from Glasgow to purchase a car from Inchcape VW Bolton on my arrival I would say everyone was very welcoming and friendly. The sales guys make a great team ensuring the purchase experience was memorable, they really couldn't do any more to make my purchase any more relaxed and pleasant. A particular big thank you to Shiraz and Chris."
5/4/17,5,Great friendly service. Excellent communication skills shown by service reception and very helpful towards me. Clean and efficient service work carried out. Highly recommended.
5/4/17,5,"Overall I am very happy with the service I have received from Crawley Audi. My last 3 cars have been from them, and my daughter has purchased from them too. I've found them to be competitive on every occasion and the deals I have been given have ensured my repeat business. As my vehicles have been low mileage I have limited experience of the servicing side, which has been in the main ok."
5/4/17,5,Excellent customer service and knowledgeable staff.
5/4/17,5,"Great service before, during and after buying the car. I was kept fully informed at every stage from its arrival in the country, delivery and me turning the key for the first time... and as other reviewers have pointed out they do provide a good cup of coffee."
5/4/17,5,"I would highly recommend Hunters Chester to anyone looking to buy a Land Rover. I have bought a number of Cars from them & also referred other friends to them. I always find they are helpful, knowledgeable & friendly."
5/4/17,5,Both the business manager Adam and sales exec Adam were amazing and went out of there way to make sure I was happy with my purchase after a few rocky moments at the beginning. I would really recommend Mini Cooper Ipswich to anyone!
5/4/17,5,From the moment we were welcomed into the showroom to delivery of the new car we were given 5 star service.
5/3/17,2,"Bought a Jaguar XE from HA Fox Derby. Smooth, trouble free transaction - they couldn't do enough for us. So why am I having a whinge ? Prior to signing on the dotted line, they offered to supply our personalised plates. Unfortunately they didn't fit (wrong shape) and were drilled in the wrong place. No problem they said, we'll get some more sorted. It was the last thing I heard from them. Several emails, all ignored, led me to believe they had had my business and now I could co-co !! After sales service - you're having a laugh. Decided I would let it go - Number plates are only a few quid after all - but I would register my slight displeasure with the head Honcho. Was he bothered ? Not really...Just told me how good his colleague (the email recipient) was at his job - (but he can't be that good if he doesn't respond to customers). Never heard anything more. Quite strange that something so minor can sour the experience. There is a problem with the Jag in that my wife has claimed it and I am relegated to an aging Volvo. The Volvo will be replaced by another Jag next January. Are HA Fox getting my business...? Don't think so."
5/3/17,5,"Lovely people, great products, and service to match"
5/2/17,1,"I took my Golf into Inchcape Colchester for its ""Nox fix"" on Friday. I was met by Ian who told me that it would be ready in an hour or so and they would wash the car as well. I explained that I needed to attend to some work via the internet and he told me that it might not be working. I asked if I could see a salesman as the Golf comes to the end of its PCP in June. He said he'd get someone to see me - I went for a coffee and discovered that the internet was indeed not working. The salesman didn't turn up, I walked around the showroom and a salesman introduced himself to me - I explained what i was looking for and he told me that he was busy but if I wanted to have a look around outside and let someone know if I needed more help. As I was looking around the outdoor showroom i was briefly greeted by another salesman who explained that he was also busy with the end of the month coming.... I'd been there about an hour and then noticed that my car was parked out the front of the showroom so enquiried if it was ready? No, it had just been washed and the Nox fix still needed doing. Somewhat frustrated by the lack of salemen I sat and waited for almost another hour. When Ian eventually came to tell me it was ready I said that the promised salesman had not materialised - standard phrase for Inchcape ""no problem"" was as near to an apology as I got.
Aware that Inchcape were running a promotion that finished on Sunday I called Inchcape on Saturday morning to make a specific appointment and spoke with Dominic who said he remembered seeing me the day before - he said he was busy but would be free after 3.30 pm and we could have an hour and a half until they closed to look at a new deal for me. Making a special journey we got stuck in traffic through Colchester and arrived about 5 minutes late. The receptionist said she would let Dominic know we were there and please haev some coffee. We had the obligatory coffee and used the facilities and there was still no sign of Dominic or anyone else to help with the time coming up for 4 pm. Nice though the coffee was we had better things to do than sit in a showroom having arrived for an appointment for the salesman not even to acknowledge our existence.
I asked the receptionist to let Dominic know that we were going to leave and I'd take my business to another brand where I did not have to beg someone to sell me a car. Standard answer, you guessed it ""no problem"". A person called John then intervened and explained that he would have helped us but he was still waiting for a customer with a 3.30 appointment and he couldn't attend to a walk-in. The fact that we were not a walk-in seem to be lost on both him and the receptionist, although he did say that we were a priority customer as a returning PCP customer.
I wonder what treatment a non-priority customer might receive?
I responded to the automatically generated email received on Sunday morning asking me to confirm that I had had a great experience, indicating that I certainly hadn't and I'd like a response. It's now Tuesday afternoon and I'm still waiting.
I will vote with my feet, or my tyre treads, and buy a new car from another brand where I might reasonably expect some respect."
5/1/17,5,"As always treated with polite and helpful staff.
Not just a number.
Thank you."
5/1/17,1,"They cannot get even the bookings right! They costed me 2 trips, 3.5 hours in 2 days for a 10min job! They said it would take 2 hours with a car wash and 1 hour without a car wash. Thry are lying and encouraging people to avoid car wash but I still waited for 2.5 hours!!! I don't recommend VW to anyone! It took 18+ months to fix dodgy code related to their emissions scandal in 2015!!! It affected millions of cars around the world! Are we supposed to trust these guys and their partners?! No!"
5/1/17,5,"I had a great sales experience from Lynsey and the rest of the sales team from end to end when buying my new Tiguan. It couldn't have possibly went any more seamlessly. The service really was second to none. It was by far the most professional, helpful and detailed car purchase I've ever experienced (and I've bought a lot of cars!). The financials were explained to me in granular detail, i was not pushed into buying any extras i didn't ask for (like other dealerships do), and Lynsey helped me track the car from order through production, even gave me the details of the ship so i could track it on its voyage!
When i picked up the car Lynsey gave me an extremely detailed demo of all the cars technology. Its fully loaded so that took well over an hour, and she knew how everything worked down to the nth degree.
The whole experience was an absolute pleasure and great fun.
I would highly recommend buying from Inchcape Chester (Lynsey in particular), and i'll certainly be using them again."
5/1/17,5,I can highly recommend Lexus Guildford. Thank you to Jemma and all the staff for a thoroughly pleasant purchasing experience.
4/30/17,5,"Dealt with Louis at the Coopers BMW Durham dealership. He is extremely professional for a young man, his drive for customer service and his knowledge of the brand is second to none. Louis constantly kept me updated each time the status of my new car changed from factory to delivery. Great vibe in the showroom with a friendly atmosphere. I would highly recommend Coopers BMW Durham to anyone."
4/29/17,1,"I took delivery of my dream car (£32000+) in November 2016, which quickly turned into a nightmare. Multiple dealership visits (9 and counting), retailer offered to buy back the car leaving me £2000+ out of pocket with no recompense for the inconvenience of being sold a defective vehicle. Incredibly poor service by the current branch manager, issues with the vehicle still unresolved. complaint going through financial ombudsman and await their outcome. Whilst their sales team were amazing their after sales are shocking, along with the attitude of vw uk make purchasing one of this car most regrettable."
4/29/17,4,"We recently purchased a new A6 at inchcape with the help of sales executive Mohammed Mia. I would like to thank Audi for their consistent professionalism but more specifically Mohammeds courteous and considered help throughout. His manner, diligence and customer focus was warming and welcoming nad reflects positively on the brand, branch and his own ideals.

Thanks!"
4/27/17,1,"I bought a VW Tuareg in Dec and was impressed with the service and the Salesman at VW Stockport, I was told that Inchcape were absolutely dedicated to customer service and the Tuareg was a a very relable car. After 1500 miles in 5 months the sat nav failed, this was a real problem as I needed it for clinic treatment for cancer, I was late for the appointment as I couln't find the clinic. I rang the dealet and wad told they could't look at it at all for 11 days and thot no loan car would be available until the 23 rd. big problem for me, rang VW customer service who couln't help. Answer don't buy VW and don't believe assurances on customer service. I have also a Mercedes E Class, the service is fantastic, will definitely be buying another Mercedes."
4/27/17,5,Always so helpful and a pleasure to deal with.
4/26/17,5,"Picked up our new cla amg line today and couldn't have been happier with our experience. Andy Roberts has been great with us from the very beginning, Dale was really helpful showing us all around the car and it's equipment and Grant Was lovely too. The whole experience from initial contact to collection was 5 star. Nothing was too much trouble. Car shopping with two small children is not easy but they were made very welcome which helped a lot.
Thanks guys ... we will certainly be back again in the future."
4/26/17,4,"All work carried out as agreed and the unrequested advice on tyre replacement was important, helpful, welcome and accepted. The only disappointment was that the side walls of the new tyres were left covered in adhesive."
4/26/17,5,"BMW Malton in my view provide a friendly & professional service. Regardless with who you interact with - receptionist, personnel in the service department, technical, or sales staff - you feel valued as a customer, and confident that you are in the hands of competent individuals."
4/26/17,5,"Dealt with Ashley Hargreaves from first contact he was very helpful, had a thorough test drive, and through out the sale he was there to answer any queries I had.
This service is part of the reason I bought the car from this garage even though it was 150 miles away.
Would highly recommend."
4/26/17,4,"We receive courteous and friendly service from Cooper BMW at Boldon. Our experience here is significantly superior to the rather off-hand, patronising attitude we have been subjected to in the past from the likes of Fawdingtons (now known as Lloyd.)

As ever however, I would counsel great care in agreeing a final specification for a new vehicle. I find BMW 'options' a bit of a minefield to negotiate and the jargon used can make it difficult to really understand what you're getting! If there is any room for improvement at Cooper Boldon I suggest that some more detailed assistance from sales staff in this respect would be welcome.
The deatership here now has an on-site 'genius' who explained and demonstrated some aspects of the technology in our new X1, including the Parking Assist feature. She tried very hard but seems to lack access to any areas of the site to do this. She really needs more supprt in the form of resources to do her job.

I would be happy to return to Cooper BMW at this location for any further purchases."
4/26/17,3,"Review for Mercedes-Benz of Oxford
During sales we were quite pleased but aftersales was very poor as we had to chase them to get things done and move forward and to get information which was a basic after sales customer service. We always bought brand new cars of different makes and we can say Mercedes unfortunately couldnt win in terms of customer service. However after complaining someone else took over handling with our issues which then went smoother."
4/25/17,5,Very good customer service. Amanda does wonders. Tailor-made deals catering to all tastes.
4/25/17,5,"Very well looked after from start to finish...Special thanks to the Sales Consultant, Stefan."
4/24/17,5,Fantastic service
4/24/17,5,"Very good, considering that I am an awkward bugger when it comes to buying & selling cars. I am impressed with the friendliness & patience of the sales staff. Plus of course, the good deal that I came away with for the second time. No other dealership put in the same effort to get my business. The service I have received in the past looking after my previous car was excellent."
4/24/17,5,"I have purchased 3 new minis over 18 months from cooper reading, the last one being a jcw, my saleswoman was Danielle, you have to ask for her, say Barry sent you, I guarantee she will give you 100%. Nothing is too much to ask her,
I new what I wanted, she never palmed me off with, we have that one, she searched, made calls, rang me when she said she would. Very rare now!
After finding the car, she went beyond the call of duty, staying late into the evening for the delivery of it,
The whole sales team and manager seem to gel, it makes parting with your cash less painful lol.
Give them a go, you won't be disappointed. A sterling job."
4/24/17,2,"The service reception & arrangements for a lift to & from work were both exceptional. However, I noticed a small ding on my driver door & a number of paint chips on my passenger door when I got my car home - not happy!!"
4/24/17,3,Was kept waiting 30 minutes at drop off and 45 at pick up.
4/24/17,3,"My son bought his first car recently which should have been an exciting experience.

When we picked up the car we noticed several marks and realised the car was covered in a sticky glue like substance. This we were told was from the wrapping which is on the new cars when they get delivered into the dealership. We also noticed a stone chip and the car had heavy swirl marks. We were told that they would arrange for the car to be collected the following week and it would be sorted.

I chased up the following week and arranged to take the car in myself and we agreed a date which was roughly a month after picking the car up.

Today was the day and I must say I'm not at all satisfied with the results. The stone chip is no better and some of the glue was still on the car. I should of insisted on checking the car over with someone before leaving but they were happy to just give me the key and let me go.

I am disappointed that they never bothered to give the car a clean whilst it was in. I'm going to get it booked in elsewhere to be sorted and won't bother with the dealer again.

In hindsight I should have rejected the car on collection until they sorted the problems.

We paid cash for the car and didn't take out the finance package nor did we go for any of there over priced add ons which is probably why we had to chase up getting it back to them, had to wait a month and still not get a satisfactory outcome.

I don't have an issue with the sales man who was excellent but find their aftersales poor. It wasn't him who said they would sort the car but someone more senior. If this person was more interested in over seeing this rather than walking away from it ii wouldn't be leaving this review. It was him after all that made a point of us leaving a review and asking for us to do so after we had brought the car back.

So here you go."
4/24/17,1,"Very poor customer service. I own two BMW's and getting their Service team to even return a call is nigh on impossible.
I completed their BMW survey; I was extremely negative and even that did't illicit a call.
I can't recommend them as a dealership."
4/24/17,3,"Service was OK but nothing special, Initially tried to book me in for a higher priced service than the one requested or needed despite having my service history and knowing my mileage."
4/24/17,5,Excellent service from taking my Pasat to VW and collecting the hire car. Collected my car in the afternoon and all paperwork was smooth and efficient and I was well looked after by Natasha.
4/24/17,5,"Great hassle free service, collected my wife's car in the morning as arranged and delivered back in the afternoon all clean and tidy."
4/24/17,5,"very efficient, courteous and accommodating"
4/23/17,1,"Test drove two VWs in Colchester. No price on the day (Saturday), left contact details. Chased up on the Thursday. Was told I would get prices on the coming Saturday. No contact.
Called the following Tuesday, said I wanted someone else to deal with it as rep Bashir was no good for me. That afternoon Bashir tried to call and give me just one quote, despite trying two different types of vehicle.
I asked him to email the quotes, as I was still at work.
Still waiting.
Useless is not the word, better off going to Ipswich. I've now got two new cars from elsewhere. Useless
Mr Watson"
4/23/17,5,Attentive sales staff and great customer service. Very happy with the overall experience. A smaller outfit but excellent team.
4/23/17,5,"From the second I arrived the team at Cheshire Oaks couldn't do enough the whole experience was magical, from start to finish Joanna, Lauren and Daley were amazing. Can't thank them enough."
4/22/17,5,"I bought my VW Move Up! from this branch. I recently had it in for an 'air conditioning servicing' which they recommend you get done after a couple of years after purchase. I can't say I noticed much difference with the air conditioning, but they cleaned it inside and out, fixed the tyre pressure and gave it a check up in the garage so I'm happy."
4/22/17,5,"Very friendly and helpful, would recommend garage to anyone 👍"
4/21/17,2,"Have had a long running issue (1year) over a refund for 4 tyres. They then lost all four tyres. Nobody, including the service manager have ever returned my call. They said they didnt bother to complete any paperwork. I'm £800 out of pocket. The service manager made promises but I never heard anything. I can only assume I was fed lies in the hope I'd get tired and give up. So yes it's been a year now and I don't have the time to keep on at them just to be lied to. I'm getting my XF serviced elsewhere from now on."
4/21/17,5,"I am very pleased with my tiguan,Adam was most helpful in finding me the right car to suit my needs as i was finding my old car difficult.Nothing was too much trouble and he explained everything clearly.I have just come back from Cornwall and found the tiguan extremely economical with everything one could want for a comfortable journey.My grandsons are well impressed.They are showing me how to use all my gadgets."
4/21/17,5,"Always very good personal service. Nothing is too much trouble, highly recommended."
4/21/17,5,Always professional and helpful. Highly recommended.
4/21/17,5,Excellent friendly service
4/21/17,5,"We visited this branch to view a Mercedese c class , having made an appointment the day before , we arrived to meet salesman Sonny Bharker.
From minute one we we're impressed with the curtios and professional way we were looked after, without ever being pushy . We were offered numerous cups of coffee etc .
On the car deal, we were offered a good price for our old car that we part exchanged which made our new purchase affordable .we purchased a Mercedese c class amg line . We also purchased a service plan which was actually cheaper than the plan we had on our Vauxhall insignia ! Along with the gap ins and Guard x paint protection purchased you could say that Sonny did a good days work but like I said before none of this was sold in a pushy way . We drove the car away with a free 7 day insurance
, and also proceeded to get a quote to insure the c class through Mercedese which to my surprise was very competitive !
All in all , yes you get what you pay for , but I would not hesitate to recommend Mercedes Inchape Notts to anyone . Sonny was a credit to the branch !

4/21/17,5,"Booking online was straight forward and then on day ...was all very efficient and quick. I had Paul Moore dealing with my service for my E class, was really informative and helpful. Certainly would recommend this to anyone looking for a service."
4/21/17,5,Very good everyone very helpfull everything made very easy and stress free.
4/21/17,5,Excellent service and ask for Nilesh and he is great in giving discounts...
4/21/17,3,"Car Service was fine, but telephoned three times with a follow up query to service department and was advised I would be called back. This did not happen.
Outcome was that I purchased new tyres elsewhere and have booked MOT elsewhere, and my loyalty to Mercedes is now in doubt( I have had seven Cars including the the current E & A Class's)"
4/21/17,5,Excellent service from Mercedes staff
4/21/17,1,"Warranty claim, very poor service, I will not buy another Mercedes!"
4/21/17,5,"Excellent team at Mercedes Inchcape Loughborough, service always excellent"
4/21/17,5,"10 out of 10, faultless customer service. Perfect experience all round."
4/20/17,3,service record book was NOT filled in by engineer. I have not yet contacted them about this though.
4/20/17,5,Helpful staff and friendly service from professional people
4/20/17,5,"Excellent service. Professional and friendly. Good quality loan car and my car returned on time even though I had asked for it to be ready earlier than expected due to a change in my plans. I liked the extra touch this time of the video by the mechanic checking the underside of my car.

They could do with improving their telephone process when booking a service as having to speak to 3 different people is not in keeping with the rest of the service provided."
4/20/17,5,Jonny at the Bolton Branch was a great help and went the extra mile for me to ensure that the collection of my new car was perfect. Couldn't have been happier with the service I received on the day on purchase and collection.
4/20/17,5,"Beautiful, modern and clean showroom. Fantastic reception team who are welcoming and always remember me as a loyal customer. Bought my car through Tim and received fantastic service from the moment the my Golf R was ordered to when I turned up to collect it. Donna in after sales has looked after me and my cars since I got my first Golf at age 17 back in 2008 and I wouldn't want anyone else to look after me and my car than Volkswagen Stockport. Keep up the good work."
4/20/17,1,Hunters failed to live up to a Land Rover dealer expectation
4/20/17,3,"Vehicle was serviced and a few items were noted as requiring attention.
I.E. Rear brake pads were 45% worn, windscreen washer/blades smearing.
I was called by Jaguar and a discounted price was agreed over the telephone and vehicle booked in for new brake pads.
I fitted new wiper blades myself.
On arriving at HA Fox Southampton the price on the worksheet was the original non discounted price which I would not agree to and stated unless the price agreed over the telephone was applied I was willing to walk away.
After what appeared to grudgingly agreeing to the discounted price the work was carried out satisfactory.
On completion of the work it was pointed out the windscreen was still smearing and needed either new wipers or the windscreen washer pumps could be faulty and a charge of £115 would be required for investigation. This is a common fault on this vehicle as the washer bottle gets contaminated with what is commonly called GUNGE.
I removed the offside front wheel arch liner removed the washer pump and flushed the bottle with copious amounts of fresh water cleaning the aforesaid GUNGE.
It must be noted that I should have returned the vehicle soon after purchasing the vehicle as the washers, in my opinion, did not appear satisfactory from picking it up in March 2016."
4/20/17,5,"From reception through to collecting the car and on to after Sales, you would not have asked for anymore. Mercedes can learn a lot from Lexus.

The car drives beautifully and has every EXTRA to make your driving experience more pleasurable."
4/20/17,5,I bought my car from them hassle free great help with all my needs.had 3 services with them also hassle free what more could you ask for.
4/20/17,3,"Salesman very keen when obtaining order, but did not reply to follow queries."
4/20/17,5,Excellent service at all stages of my new car purchase. Jonnie was great to deal with and kept me informed throughout my buying experience.
4/20/17,5,"As usual, excellent service and a job well done."
4/20/17,5,Excellent service from Chris Spurrell. Very happy with my purchase.
4/20/17,5,"My vehicle has been serviced at Peasmarsh for many years. Although the company changed, the key people (to me) haven't. Will and James will look after you well."
4/20/17,5,The welcome is always amazing-smiling staff always willing to give loads of information and coffee-even if you are not buying at that moment!
4/20/17,5,I had Very good experience with Lexus derby when I took my car for a recall thank you
4/20/17,1,"Absolutely TERRIBLE service, unprofessional and frankly crooked!

This year we are taking my wifes MB to the Derbyshire franchise for its service as last year we were left dumbfounded!
My wife had her car serviced with the Nottingham branch, they arranged to pick the car from her work and drop it back afterwards. All seemed until a a week later a Bus Lane violation fine dropped on the doorstep. It had a photo of the car being driven up a bus lane while they were delivered it back to my wife.
We contacted them and they asked for proof which we sent, the Service Manager then told my wife it would be easier if she paid the fine and then they would reimburse her.
Guess what happened! My wife paid it, then sent the receipt in and she was ignored. She emailed, phoned and even sent a recorded delivery letter but had no response.
In the end she gave up as the sales manager was always unavailable and never called back!
Absolutely Disgraceful from a professional company such as MB. They have no excuse for this appalling behavior, they should have paid the fine themselves, but I guess the Service Manager was trying to protect himself at our expense!

Update : Derbyshire MB have just told us whoever did the last service didn't update the computer ECU about the service, they are going to phone Inchcape and ask.. Now Im wondering if they even serviced it at all!!!!!

!!!!!DO NOT USE INCHCAPE!!!!!"
4/19/17,5,Used this dealership for nearly 10 years since I bought my first Jaguar from them. Now on my second car I am still very pleased with the care and consideration as well as service I have received from HA Fox Norwich. I can honestly say I have not had a bad experience or faulty work done or any complaint about the service my car and I have recieved. Over 50 years of motoring I have been involved with good and bad frustrating dealerships but all the staff at HA Fox have treated me as a VIP and I see that with other customers as well. It is clear customer satisfaction and service is high on their list of priorities and they do not fall short. Highly recommended
4/19/17,3,"The wrong number plate had been fitted to our new vehicle, as our sales rep was on holiday we struggled to get anyone to take ownership of the problem and had to keep ringing to find out what was happening. It would appear to us that Hunters Land Rover staff are particularly bad at calling back when requested."
4/19/17,5,Always excellent service from all members of the Hunters team
4/19/17,4,Friendly and helpful staff but recall work took nearly two hours and I had to sit and wait as no courtesy car was offered . Refreshments were available on a serve yourself basis !
4/19/17,5,very good service
4/19/17,5,"My recent visit to the Norwich branch of H.A. Fox, was, as has always been my experience, quite excellent. I am happy for all members of the service department to be made aware of my assessment !"
4/19/17,4,"Very good at what they do, Joe is an excellent salesman."
4/19/17,5,"Perfect as always, Sue in Service is a pleasure to deal with as is James in Sales.

Best Dealer in Romford and i have been to them all."
4/19/17,5,"Locally based, well organised and vehicle ready on time. Although extremely busy they find time to listen to trivial questions when approached."
4/18/17,1,A terrible and dishonest service culminating in Mercedes oxford Inchcape trying to charge my account £1000. Not phoning back. Not emailing back. Not returning money as promised. Making false claims and misleading statements. Buyer beware.
4/18/17,1,"ON THE 07.03.17. MY CAR WAS SERVICED, M.O.T. TESTED, AND THE BRAKE FLUID REPLACED AS RECOMMENDED.
THE FOLLOWING DAY THE LEFT/REAR DOOR OPENED AND SET THE ALARM OFF, THE KEY WAS NOT IN RANGE. THE FOLLOWING DAY WENT ON HOLIDAY, AFTER 10 MILES AND REACHING 40 MPH. THE CAR WAS MAKING A LOUD NOISE FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR, GOT OUT TO CHECK THE TYRES, O.K. THE NOISE GOT PROGRESSIVLY WORSE. ON RETURN FROM HOLIDAY INFORMED FOX PRESTON AND REQUESTED THE NOISE BE INVESTIGATED AND REPAIRED. THE CAR WAS DUE TO BE COLLECTED AT 8-15 A.M. ON 27.03.17. I WAITED TILL MID MORNING AND SPOKE TO LEWIS ON THE SERVICE DESK, HIS REPLY WAS THE DRIVER WAS OFF SICK, AND HE FORGOT TO INFORM ME.
THE CAR WAS RE-BOOKED FOR THE REPAIRS TOBE CARRIED OUT ON 11TH APRIL AT 8-15 A.M. THE DRIVER DID NOT TURN UP AND FOX PRESTON DID NOT HAVE THE COURTESEY TO CALL ME AND EXPLAIN THE CAUSE.
SEVERAL OTHER FAULTS ON THE SECURITY SYSTEM APPEARED.
SPOKE TO RYON AT FOX PRESTON, HE PROMISED TO LOOK INTO THE PROBLEM, AND RE-BOOKED THE CAR IN FOR THE REPAIRS ON TUESDAY 18.04.17. AT 8-15 A.,M. FOR THE THIRD TIME FOX PRESTON HAVE LET ME DOWN, THEY HAVE NOT COLLECTED THE CAR, AND NO EXPLANATION.
FOX PRESTON HAVE HANDLED THIS SITUATION APPALLINGLY AND I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THEM.
I AM ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT THE WHEEL BEARINGS ON A JAGUAR FAILED AT 54,000 MILES, PARTICULARLY A FEW DAYS AFTER A FULL SERVICE AND M.O.T. TEST."
4/17/17,5,"Coopers Reading, where excellent to deal with and are very happy with our new Mini.
A special thanks goes to Luca, who was extremely understanding and helpful."
4/15/17,5,"Very pleased with Coopers my local BMW dealership. I bought an X5 M Sport from them in March of this year. Got a top class service from the dealership. The salesperson who dealt with me (Kevin Cole) was very professional, helpful and friendly throughout. I was so pleased with Kevin and the rest of their team that I even convinced a very closed friend of mine who was thinking of changing his car, to buy a car from this dealership. He also bought an X5. I think the real test of this BMW dealership starts from now as it comes to providing an after sales service as majority of the leading dealerships often disappoints their customers when it comes to this."
4/13/17,5,"Excellent customer service , definitely went the extra mile, all round, and would certainly recommend you in the future.Nothing was too much trouble and all questions answered in detail and honestly."
4/13/17,1,"We bought our Audi A3 convertible through Inchcape Audi Tunbridge Wells in May 2015 and had a very good sales experience. However, when it comes to service or an issue, service is the last thing on their mind. Communication between desks in the service department in reminiscent to a stay at Fawlty Towers and any thought of looking after a customer of the franchise goes out the window. We love the car and had every intention of buying another model next year, but not now. Two services within the space of 4 weeks, which should have occurred at the same time, 14 phone calls, 3 points where we told to pay for a repair to a sun visor, after we were told that it would be covered under warranty or because it must have been a fault. Repair to a sun visor eventually happened after three reminders to service to order the parts, as they had forgotten. All in all, we would keen to forget this comedy of errors. Shame, because it's a nice car."
4/13/17,5,"Excellent service from all staff involved, had my MOT done, plenty of newspapers, beverages, and car was cleaned inside and out.

Cannot fault them.

Well done."
4/13/17,2,"I took my VW in to have air con regassed after buying it from another VW dealership who had sold it to me with the air con not working. Anyway, when I booked the car in via the central booking line I was told I could have a lift to work and lift back from work by VW. When I asked at the branch what time they could pick me up, they said they finished at 4pm, so they couldn't come and pick me up. I then had to get a tram from Manchester City Centre to Altrincham which cost me £5 and a further ten minute walk. I wouldn't have minded at all but I was told I could have a lift. When I asked about this at the VW centre they basically shrugged their shoulders and said it wasn't their fault. Not great customer service. The other thing is I was sent an online survey about my experience, which I filled in and was told someone would call me in 4 hours. 24 hours later, I still haven't got a call. I don't really care about any of this but don't proclaim to care about your customers when in reality you don't give a rat's *ss! Having said that, all the staff I dealt with were very nice and they fixed the problem with my car"
4/13/17,1,Get told lies was when I was getting me deposit back every time I asked to speak to a manager the reseption could deal with a simply phone connection to the financial manager and got sent to a different department
4/12/17,1,"I have asked Cooper Croydon to quote for and Inspection II 3 times - via phone, email and in person at the dealership. No one phones back. This is not rocket science - Cooper quote value service pricing on the Z4 range and on the M range. I have a Z4M, and the query is where this fits and how much you will charge. Simples. If you r don't want the business it would be courteous to simply say so. I am quite happy to use Park Lane who also service my 6-Series Grand Coupe, or a decent independent."
4/12/17,5,The 5 stars says it all. I have no reservations and would and have already recommended Inchcapaudi to a friend. In particular I would like to say how impressed I was with the sales executive Iain Boyd who dealt with me. He was extremely professional at all times and bearing in mind my age was very helpful and was always happy to go over things again when I did not quite understand the first time. He was never pushy but helped when I needed it. Having purchased many cars throughout my life I found Iain to be one of the most helpful knowledgeable and extremely pleasant to deal with.
4/12/17,4,"It was a very good experience and service. It was done quickly and I was kept informed on what was going on with my car. It was also cleaned very well. The only issue I had was that I was picking my car up later than when it was ready, the said it was fine to pick it up when I was ready. I was under the impression I would pay when i picked it up, however this wasn't the case, the payment had to be made before 1pm and I was in a situation where I didn't have my purse. If I was informed of this I could have made sure I had my card details to hand."
4/12/17,1,"Not impressed with phone communication service!
I was a potentially new customer - rang for information about having an MOT and Service done and the lady I spoke to was not that helpful and sounded like she couldn't really be bothered! I had questions about what needed to be done but didn't feel convinced she really knew and she just said they were really busy and I wouldn't be able to have a delivery service or courtesy car until May - about a month away and this is after my MOT runs out! Not impressed - didn't seem to want my custom Will have to go elsewhere! :-("
4/12/17,4,"Good contact by eMail, aware of what was happening, sent video of underneath car. Some work carried out under warranty without issues.

Courtesy car was an ""Up'. Fine for my needs but not sure it would suit some business users."
4/12/17,5,Great customer service
4/12/17,5,"I am comfortable with members of the Inchcape team, who are all helpful and deal with all enquiries in a clear and helpful way.
No issues whatever. A fine team, dedicated to serving their customers"
4/12/17,5,"Always the same excellent reception service, and a call back as promised. Happy to recommend Mercedes at Loughborough."
4/11/17,5,"My vehicle was collected and returned all done, serviced and cleaned."
4/11/17,5,Excellent service!
4/11/17,5,Excellent customer service from start to finish. Would not hesitate to recommend. Worth investigating if you are looking for a new vehicle.
4/11/17,1,"Do not be fooled by the patter this is appalling.
When they sold me a crash damaged car It took almost 3 months for them to finally offer a replacement car and only after I had an independent valuation which pointed out the crash damage, and this is a main dealer!
They offered a new replacement with more cash from myself (I should have walked away) the new car developed a problem which they could not find, yet after purchasing a diagnostic scanner £200, I identified it on the first scan, I was then asked to have this verified by another dealer (120mile round trip) before they would repair the car all while the 30 day 1000miles replacement had run out. When returned to me the car has many problems from vibration to noise and back which they are unable and unwilling to correct.
Is this practice even legal?
They even got my name wrong twice how insulting this is to a cash purchaser (over £20K) APPALLED!!!!!!!!!!"
4/11/17,5,"The Inchcape team is professional, the environment is slick and the facilities are conducive to passing time if you prefer to wait for your vehicle."
4/10/17,5,I would recommend H A Fox Jaguar York with no hesitation. We were served by Michael Frith who was absolutely brilliant. We were looking to change our car and had been round a few showrooms but decided to look at Jaguars. From start to finish he was friendly approachable and very knowledgeable and you could tell he loved Jaguars. It was like talking to a friend and he made us feel at ease. He made the whole process extra enjoyable.
4/10/17,5,"Excellent service and very friendly staff, who gave us the information and let us come to our own decision. No high pressure techniques. Matthew answered our questions in an honest and relaxed manner, giving us pros and cons on the two models we were looking for. He even advised us to look at Fully Comprehensive Insurance, saying that it was often cheaper nowadays than TPF&T, which it did prove to be by over 50%. I would recommend Inchcape Brentford to anyone looking for a VW, who wants a huge choice of models in one place, with good, honest and friendly staff"
4/10/17,5,Always helpful and professional.
4/10/17,5,First class service as usual
4/10/17,5,"Very good service,keep you informed if anything is required and all on time"
4/10/17,5,"The service and support we received was truly outstanding. Samantha Riggott, Sales Executive was fantastic. Very responsive, knowledgeable and everything happened seamlessly. This was the best car buying experience I have ever had.

Outstanding!"
4/10/17,5,"Easy to get appointment you need.
On the day everything goes smooth.
No complaint about the service, its the aftercare which is wanting.

Windscreen wash refill OK although was too concentrated, diluted 3 times before getting the right mix.

The workshop never bothered to wipe down the engine cover although the car exterior was washed, which is a shame because the car cant leave garage when engine bay looks like it has been on the farm for years.
The interior of the car cleaning is rubbish, can you please add another £5 0r £10 to the price of the service so the interior can be cleaned satisfactorily."
4/10/17,5,The sales staff arranged test drives and provided information to allow us to come to a decision on vehicle purchase in a relaxed and unpressurised environment.
4/9/17,5,"Excellent service, polite, friendly, we received great advice to allow us to make the right purchase which we are delighted with."
4/9/17,5,"What an absolute delight in spending money. Jamie Lucas the Sales man was top line. Not pushy no pressure, very kind. Everyone at Inchcape we're excellent"
4/9/17,2,"I have just bought a new Audi A3 from Cheshire Oaks. In my initial review I gave them 'Top Marks'. The Audi I traded in had a Bose radio and I was told my new car had Bang and Olufsen sound system but this is not the case!! Although I am happy with the sound system I wish I had been told that I would not be getting a car with Bang and Olufsen sound system.
Mrs H.D Thomson."
4/9/17,5,"I had my car serviced at Inchcape Volkswagen Bolton. I found everything done within the time stated for my service. They went through everything with me when I picked my car up & even emailed me a video. Nothing was too much trouble. I would Definatley recommend.
Well done!"
4/9/17,5,Always excellent service.
4/8/17,5,Have used this dealership for my current and last BMW for servicing and repairs. Always satisfied with personal attention given by all staff and work carried out to high standard - everything I would expect from a premium brand.
4/8/17,5,My third purchase from them over the last 10 years and as always a great experience either buying or having a Service completed. Claire was a great person to deal with and I was most impressed with the efforts taken to find an in stock car with the spec I wanted ( Sun Roof-Quattro-Leather etc.) in the small choice of colours I was prepared to accept. Thanks to Sam as well.
4/8/17,5,"Excellent, friendly and very efficient. Hilary and David Cooper very helpful."
4/8/17,5,"Excellent from when I arrived to getting loan car and from returning
In afternoon to pick up my car could Not have gone sweeter.
The assistance I got throughout was First class and would and have recommended to some of my friends .
My car was re turned in as good as new condition.
Explained to body shop manager what a great job,
Regards A,Bourne"
4/8/17,3,Took car in for key renewall and new door handle checked over tyres as suggested only reported depth didn't ask any further enquires about tyre condition to come up with solutions to improve?
4/7/17,5,Gavin was very helpful. The service spot on. Good car. All in all very good and a happy customer.
4/7/17,4,Excellent service with the exception of a delay returning my deposit
4/7/17,4,"nice dealership easy to get to

great cars plenty of choice

not many shop floor staff around at weekends when most business is done presumably
in a rush to sell cars I thought

this is my fourth mini from this dealership and it was my least enjoyable buying experience ??"
4/7/17,4,late with the delivery but offered a quality loan car until ours was ready.
4/7/17,5,The service I received from the dealership was prompt and delivered in a friendly manner. The staff kept me informed as to the progress of the service and I was offered plenty of refreshments. Overall totally happy.
4/7/17,1,dealing with bmw for 20yrs this dealers is the worst
4/7/17,5,"Absolute first class service. As soon as you walk in there is a meet and greet. The reception ladies are extremely professional, very smart and always offer refreshment etc. Used Craig this visit but who ever looks after me it's superb service!"
4/7/17,5,As always staff are well trained at Coopers Ipswich and very helpful in dealing with clients.
4/7/17,5,Very good ..... friendly & thorough service.
4/7/17,5,"All good re servicing, did what they said, good venue/facilities to work from whilst car being serviced."
4/7/17,2,Dealership is overworked and understaffed with lack of space for customer's cars. Booking a car in takes weeks. The initial service advisor knew less about what was required than I did. He tried to tell me the service wasn't due for 18k miles. Had the car serviced and it was handed back with a new fault not previously present. It took 2 attempts to cure the fault and a considerable amount of my time. The service manager ultimately sorted the problems out for me but it shouldn't have been necessary for me to escalate the situation. Without doubt the worst dealership experience consistently here compared to all I have used in the last 20 years
4/7/17,3,"Great when they are trying get you to purchase the car but poor afterwards.
Calls not returned I had to do all the chasing.
when picking up car other customers are sat down with long waits although it appears the dealership has plenty of staff."
4/7/17,5,"From the first moment I arrived at the site I was made to feel like a welcomed friend and was treated at the highest level
I was most impressed with the video guide to the work done on our car
The lady who was dealing with me was warm and welcoming and was very professional in all our dealing
I would recommend the services to my friends"
4/7/17,5,"Excellent communications from the team at Peasmarsh.
Clear and what work was being carried out. Worked with the LR Warranty company to approve all work.
James Holland is top notch....no direct relation to me!"
4/6/17,5,"I took my car to VW West London for a service/MOT and I was impressed enough to want to give them a 5-star rating.
The staff were courteous and respectful.
Only essential work was suggested and work was carried out at a high quality and competitive pricing.
Additionally, their new building presented a pleasant experience."
4/6/17,5,Really attentive to my needs and became an ally against my wife in supporting me to acquire the car I wanted rather than the one my wife thought I needed! All done with good humour.
4/6/17,4,Yes i like it.
4/6/17,5,Very friendly staff and very pleased with the service
4/6/17,5,Recent Annual Service for my LR Freelander 2 was efficient and well executed with due consultation through the process. The vehicle was returned with administration completed and the vehicle valeted.
4/6/17,5,I was greeted by a friendly sales man. He was not pushy in the slightest. He helped me to make my decision in purchasing a new Golf. I would recommend visiting Inchcape Shrewsbury to all my friends and family. Thank you!
4/6/17,5,"Andy, my salesman, was helpful from the start. He understood what I wanted, explained things to me and wasn't pushy. I left the show room knowing I had ordered the right car for me. Andy kept in touch, letting me know the progress of my car. When I went to collect the car Andy took time to ensure I was comfortable with the controls and happy to drive home."
4/6/17,5,"Excellent service throught the transaction, Lexus sales team couldn't have been more helpful"
4/6/17,5,"The two sales persons were very helpful with information, without being ""pushy""."
4/6/17,5,"Efficient, friendly AND professional service. Although I was only in for a quick recall appointment I was made to feel like a valued customer. Top marks to Service Manager Henry and his team."
4/6/17,5,"I originally booked for a recall but the service light came on a couple of days before my appointment.
The service receptionist was most helpful in arranging for the service to be done along with the recall, for which I'm most grateful.
I dropped my car off and then got a lift home. When the car had been sorted it was valeted and delivered back to my home, arranged by the same receptionist.
All in all a pleasant experience. Thank you."
4/6/17,5,Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.
4/6/17,5,"Proffessional service with the personal touch. Most impressed. The purchase of my new car could not have been smoother. Thanks you, Chris at Inchcape, Swindon."
4/6/17,5,really considerate and helpful from beginning to end
4/6/17,5,Great customer service from first contact to driving away in my new car and I'm sure beyond! Highly Recommended
4/6/17,5,"Polite, friendly and helpful, without being pushy.
Some great deals if you haggle"
4/5/17,5,"We called in after first going to Mercedes and being very underwhelmed, Audi was welcoming and hassle free, Neil the sales man was busy but took the time to sit with us (despite two very bored kids, thanks Neil), got us a brew then worked out the best car and deal for us, he arranged a test drive and kept us informed throughout. I bought a new car from them and they made me and the family feel special throughout the whole experience. I haven't stopped grinning like a mad man since I picked the car up, glad I went to Audi now instead of Mercedes, sorry Mercedes!"
4/5/17,5,"Great service without the hassle.
Picked my car up from the door.
Serviced it and valeted it and returned it back all in the same day.
No hassle - and did an excellent job.
Will use again."
4/5/17,5,Excellent service from the salesman
4/5/17,5,EFFICIENT PLEASANT SERVICE
4/5/17,5,"If the sales person is working with you, you are on to a winner. What matter most is the attitude of the person that you are dealing with. If they are friendly and acting professionally, then you are more than likely to deal with them.

Chris was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about his products. Everything was explained in plain English. You just feel things are going right, so you would conclude the deal with him."
4/5/17,5,Fantastic service and a great product.
4/5/17,5,Lovely people to deal with offering a professional service & a great coffee
4/5/17,5,"The team at Inchcape Toyota Guildford were very professional and were prepared to go that extra mile to satisfy my specification requirements for a new Hybrid Yaris. They were able to price the spec to my satisfaction and recommend a great colour. I obviously would have liked a better price for my old car, wouldn't we all, but overall with 0% interest and a solid PCP agreement for 36 months I was Happy. Having had the car for 1 month I am pleased with the Hybrid concept. I will have to see what happens after the PCP ends to be entirely satisfied with the whole experience."
4/5/17,5,Nice car dealt with kindly . Recommend Toyota this is my third Toyota
4/5/17,5,"First class in every department, outstanding sales team, back up second to none.

Recently purchased new I S 3000 h, great deal,love the car.

Have already recommended two friends

Geoff Sutton."
4/5/17,5,I purchased my car from the Manchester Inchcape and get it serviced at the Bolton branch. Always excellent customer service I couldn't be more happy with my car and the continued A* customer service.
4/5/17,2,"hunters promised wash and valet after service,this was not done when I returned to collect car.i then had to wait a further 30mins whilst this was done"
4/5/17,5,I had exceptional service from my 1st contact to collecting my new car. First rate in all departments.
4/5/17,5,More helpful than I expected during the buying experience and gave best discount.
4/4/17,5,Excellent & friendly service would highly recommend
4/4/17,5,Many thanks to Mark Marriott for finding me the vehicle I was looking for in the time frame given. Very courteous and efficient attention extended to me from all the staff at Mercedes Benz of North Wales. Highly recommend this dealership
4/4/17,1,"Booked for MOT. Lady said book a week earlier than actual date MOT expiry ""should it fail, you have time to get it repaired"". Car failed, then was told ""we can't fit you in for repair for 3 weeks!'.
Also, 'complimentary valet' didn't incl. a vacuuming inside as it was untouched. Will not return to VW."
4/4/17,5,"Over the years we have bought numerous MB's and we can honestly say that it is just as exciting now as the first time.
We like the relaxed atmo"
4/4/17,2,"When I delivered my car for a service I was told that the only mechanic that could service my air con was not in on that day. This meant I had to arrange to take my car back in. HA Fox have not followed up on this. I have now had my air con recharged elsewhere.
The courtesy car was not clean. I was using this as a test drive but when I booked it I was told that I may not be able to have an XE that was requested. If I had booked it as a test drive would the same apply? I did explain why I would like an XE.
I did not receive a phone call to say my car was ready but when I rung to check when it would be available I was told it was ready. I arrived about 25 minutes later but then had to wait for my car for a further 30 minutes (approx.)
On the way home I noticed that all the settings in my car had been changed. I couldn't even get connectivity with my phone. I spent another 20 minutes or so resetting functions when I arrived home.
I have already completed one review so how come I now have another one. One hand not knowing what the other is doing! Another star less!
Not a good experience and the worst I have ever had from Jaguar."
4/4/17,5,"Derby Mercedes staff are excellent.
My first experience of buying a new car and was not disappointed
The sales man and support staff second to none"
4/4/17,1,Terrible customer service. Commitments not delivered. Complaints not responded to.
4/4/17,5,"At last I have found a Land Rover dealership which I can trust. I went to Hunters with quite a specific request and unlike the other dealers in the area, they responded very promptly and found exactly what I needed and also gave me the best deal on my old car which made the whole process a good experience. The other dealers either tried to sell me something I didn't want or didn't respond and when they did, gave a wholly unrealistic deal on the part exchange.
Very happy with this dealership and highly recommend that you give them a visit."
4/4/17,5,On every visit I have been met with outstanding help from everyone I have come into contact with. The sales executive Stuart Mason who was my main point of contact could not be faulted in any way and is a credit to the Company.
4/4/17,4,First time I had used the garage and was pleased with the service and work carried out
4/4/17,5,"Bought my second Audi from Bolton Inchcape and once again it was a very well orchestrated experience by my Sales Consultant John McGiffin.
Although I was down sizing from A3 to A1 not once did it prejudice any commitment from John and people ""upstairs"" so to speak.
I was given what I believe to be a brilliant trade in price and with a holiday looming for me they went the extra mile to process the sale while I was away and what a great way to finish a holiday with my A1 S Line waiting on the driveway when I got home.
Once more thank you John in particular but all the others too in this well oiled unit."
4/4/17,5,"Sales experience was excellent over three months. Initial information detailed, informative and balanced. As a result a second visit two months later concluded with the placing of an order. Again meticulous care, customer information and the complex options managed perfectly. The vehicle was delivered on time, to specification and in perfect order. Handover information was clear, concise and enabled me to drive 250 miles immediately with total confidence. The best experience of new vehicle purchasing I have ever encountered. Full marks!"
4/4/17,5,Really easy to deal with. Returned calls prompltly and were courteous and helpful. Absolutely no hesitation in recommending the team at Hunters.
4/4/17,5,"Great customer service as always, An easy transaction and a pleasure to deal with. If you want quality and people who have a pride in what they do, Inchcape Kidlington are highly recommended."
4/4/17,5,Very professional company and couldn't do enough to help their customers.
4/4/17,5,"Friendly ,informative staff.Adam Caratella was particularly helpful with my enquiriy with ultimately me purchasing a 2 year old C class saloon.A couple of items I picked out as requiring attention were dealt with at a later date ,whereupon a loan car was made available to me on the day.Very satisfied to date with the service received by Mercedes Inchcape ,Leicester."

4/4/17,5,Excellent service....no problems at all
4/4/17,5,This is a good company to deal with. They go the extra mile to achieve customer satisfaction.
4/4/17,5,The whole experience was fantastic and the Inchcape Team were amazing with us. This is our second car from here in a year and the service is flawless. Well done to everyone and thank you for making me feel such a member of the MB family! #advocate
4/4/17,5,very professional excellent service
4/4/17,5,"We purchased the car on Thursday , I would just like to take the time to thank Hunters especially Phil Haygreen for the work you and jon put in during the deal process and also the effort you personally put in on the day . Especially the issue we thought we had with the colour and again I'd like to thank you for the way you handled it ! Myself and Amanda and little Sophie appreciated it ! Right from the start to the end of the sales process you met our expectations and we hope that our future cars may well be sourced through yourselves . Hopefully will have some time to enjoy the car soon with a little less work on the horizon .

Many thanks and kind regards

Mark ,Amanda and Sophie."
4/4/17,5,"Every aspect of my purchase was of the highest caliber.At first the salesman admitted that he did not think we would buy but was prepared to spend a great deal of time with us.Explanations were pretty simple although some of the paperwork was a bit tedious.At time of ""pick-up""again he was about the last to leave ,having spent a lot more time with us."
4/3/17,5,Excellent service before and after I collected my new Audi A3.
4/3/17,5,Excellent service and price
4/3/17,5,"Appointment was made quickly and easily within 4 days. Staff were excellent at the garage. Software update included in service was explained.

The Service was done by 14.30 so car was back on the road before the rush hour. A bonus!

(I appreciate reminders about an appointment but was a bit annoyed about being asked to ring the garage the afternoon before the appointment to confirm that I was still coming. It was not easy to use a phone that afternoon. I am not in the habit of missing appointments. I felt I was being inconvenienced for those who don't bother to turn up)."
4/3/17,5,This is the 3rd car we've bought from Crawley Audi - good service/advice !!
4/3/17,5,"Excellent service. Chris at Audi in Hyde was amazing, very helpful and had lots of time for us. I would highly recommend a visit to anyone."
4/3/17,2,"Car booked in for a service, specifically asked staff not to wash the vehicle as it had been damaged by the service before. I came to pick up the vehicle, they had washed the car and the driver side window was covered in what could best be described as a glue/sticky substance, I then had to wait another hour for them to clean this. I now have had the car back a week and it has caused the window to squeak whenever it is used and every time it is lowered it comes back up with white lines all over it."
4/3/17,5,"I am very happy to deal with Audi at Macclesfield and have a good relationship with them, Customer Service looking after myself and my A8L I cannot fault and hopefully it will continue.
kind regards
Mr M Benson Snr"
4/3/17,5,"My new Q3

I am now the very proud owner of a Q3; the service I have received throughout the whole experience has been fantastic and I would not hesitate in recommending Audi Maidstone to any one!"
4/3/17,5,"I visited Audi Tunbridge Wells to view the new Audi Q 2. I was met by a very nice sales assistant ( Clayton Cox) who was happy to show me around the vehicle and answer my numerous questions. There was no pressure selling and I felt very comfortable with the manner in which the whole discussion was handled. To cut a long story short, I purchased the vehicle and took delivery last Friday 31st March. The vehicle has exceeded my expectations. A really good purchasing experience."
4/3/17,5,Total what I expected from the quality brand of Audi and Macclesfield audi delivered that and more and would hesitate to recommended them and Adrian Ball sales executive if buying a new or used car and I ll be returning to buy my wife's car .
4/3/17,5,They are just continually helpful and focused on keeping customers delighted :-)
4/3/17,5,Very positive experience from start to finish.
4/3/17,4,"Booked my car in for annual car service, they are very busy as I couldn't get an appointment for 3 weeks. I received a text the day before service was booked in to remind me. The car was collected promptly and returned mid afternoon. As part of the service the car was washed snd vacuumed. I hadn't expected this to be done,. When the car was returned I could see it had been washed and vacuumed although there were water stains on the car and the carpets weren't very clean."
4/3/17,5,Excellent service as usual
4/3/17,3,"The initial meeting to review options and negotiate a trade in deal were fine, and all relevant contractual documents were made available and signed in a timely manner. The challenge arose when I arrived for my handover appointment at 2pm to be advised at 2.10pm that my vehicle was not on site. I can understand and appreciate that mistakes happen, but after making the appointment several days previous, and being advised that the new vehicle was already on site, I had rearranged my working schedule in order to make the appointment. What I cannot understand is that no-one was aware of this prior to the vehicle handover and thought to call me to delay the appointment. There were lots of apologies offered but no-one seemed to be in a position to offer a solution. I was advised that a transporter had already been dispatched to collect my vehicle and would be available the following day. When I then called at 3.45pm the following day, after having no communication from Audi, to enquire about collection I was advised that it had still not arrived and would be available at 6pm. So, at 6.45pm I was finally handed the keys to my new vehicle."
4/3/17,5,Professional and fast communication
4/2/17,5,We have received the most unbelievable first class service from Maidstone Audi. After encountering a problem with my new car everything was done to rectify the issue above and beyond my expectations.
4/1/17,4,"In the lead up to buying my new car I had visited a number of dealerships in my city trying to decide what to buy & where to buy from. The usual pleasantries of greeting a potential customer were experienced at all the places I went to except...it was Inchcape where I felt at ease to browse. Of course I was warmly greeted & asked if there was something I had in mind, what was missing was the ""hard sell"" of pushy salesmanship.

I was made to feel at ease to ask whatever questions I had in mind without that feeling that I was wasting their time; I was even told that I could email or ring them & they'd be happy to help. As my shortlist became shorter I did email questions/queries to the sales assistant with whom I had built a rapport; at no time did I feel the expectation of having to make a purchase despite numerous emails back and forth. I would say Inchcape excel at awesome friendly customer service!

When I had made my mind up on the car I wanted I went in to have a test drive. I was once again greeted with a smile from the now familiar sales person who came over to welcome me as soon as he saw me; as I took a seat at a desk while he went to fetch the keys, I was offered a drink by a lovely lady. Great I thought! It'll probably be a coffee dispensed from the machine; I was pleasantly surprised to be handed not only a real cup-and-saucer but also a biscuit! It's these little things that show I meant something for them and not just another customer.

The test drive was fun & friendly with chit chat along the way; in the end I was comfortably able to negotiate a suitable price with a little bonus of a year's roadside assistance & floor mats thrown in! My experience was wholly enjoyable...however, this was only marred right on pick up day when I was offered optional extras. Turning down the offers made me feel uneasy considering they'd been so caring & attentive throughout my deal. Although the offers were only optional, the suggestions put me on the spot with comments like ""...you have a new car, you'll want to keep it looking new as long as possible..."" Of course we all want to enjoy our cars for all eternity but options of buying ""virtual umbrellas"" to protect the paintwork were definitely suggestions of ""hard sell"" and not ""hard shell"" - if the paintwork isn't going to last then why not include the optional extras in an increased price?

So, what of Inchcape compared to other dealers? I would have to rate the customer service highly despite the after-taste of the purchase. Given the financial opportunity, I would definitely return to my Inchcape branch to purchase another new vehicle and certainly direct friends/family towards Inchcape; they just need to find alternative strategies to offering optional extras."
4/1/17,5,"Excellent service.
Offered a drink when car was taken in, and also when it was collected.
It was my VW polos first annual service so I didn't expect anything wrong, which was the case. I received an email later in the day from Smith Knight Faye Bury, with an attachment showing a video health check of my car which was very innovative."
4/1/17,5,Fully happy with my experience from start to finish -love the car as well
3/31/17,5,"Always helpful, knowledgeable and not pushy allowing me to make the choice. Excellent customer service from beginning to end. Rebecca the salesperson updated me daily and was always available to answer questions pre and post sales."
3/31/17,5,"excellent service at Cheshire Oaks Audi.
New car buying experience made very enjoyable.
good communications from sales executive."
3/31/17,5,"From the very first time I entered the showroom I was treated as a valued customer. Friendly and efficient service, nothing was too much trouble and Leon made me very welcome. Each step of the sales process was explained and my request for a test drive was satisfied within minutes. After agreeing the price and finance options I was led through the various forms that required signing. Pick up day was arranged and went very smoothly, just a shame it rained on the way home. Happy to recommend Audi at Cheshire Oaks to any of my family and friends."
3/31/17,5,I had a great experience at Maidstone Audi. Staff were very knowledgeable and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. The sales manager was very helpful. I will go back to buy another car again!!
3/31/17,5,Very good experience received from sales team (particularly Blake) many thanks will recommend
3/31/17,5,"The whole purchasing, financial and delivery processes were spot on!"
3/31/17,1,if your thinking about buying a used car off this dealer don't ! Just looked at a used car and the salesman was a joke ! I walked away !!!!
3/31/17,1,"My experience so far been very bad. They only find a way to point out something unnecessarily to get more work on the car and extract money from us. Twice I was told about an important work needs to be done, but they themselves had done the work before and I paid for it just a couple of months ago. Not sure they really do the job properly as there are some fundamental things they don't check and I think they don't do work properly. I am really worried since I had given my car for service with them. Never go back to them again."
3/31/17,2,"Took my 1 year old car back to where I bought it from, explained I had a rust issue already and was told they don't have a body shop so take it to another dealer!!!

What great service NOT..."
3/31/17,5,Excellent customer service
3/30/17,5,Everything was great excellent service.
3/30/17,5,"Very slick, dropped me off when the car was being serviced then delivered it to my door the say after, could not have been more helpful. Also sent me a video of the actual service which was above and beyond.

5 stars no mistake:)"
3/30/17,5,Everything was superb! From the timing to the service!!
3/30/17,5,Excellent service and pleasant staff
3/30/17,5,Having paid money to a so called independent German car specialist without a resolution of the problem I entrusted my car to Inchcape. They repaired my car for less money than the independent charged me. The moral of the story is dont assume main dealers are always dearer. Inchcape have been good value for money as far as I am concerned
3/30/17,5,Always a pleasure to deal with.
3/30/17,5,"A very refreshing experience when I visited Cooper Cobham to investigate buying a new Mini Countryman for my wife.. We have been dealing with their Sales Representative Joanna Clarke who has been most helpful, professional and above all considerate of customers requirements. This is an important ingredient in building trust and good customer relations for which she and Cooper Cobham should be commended Whilst we have yet to make a final decision on my wife's next vehicle I would have no hesitation in recommending Cooper Cobham to anyone in the market for a Mini."
3/29/17,5,"I purchased a used car from Swindon Audi and dealt with David McCaw.

The whole process was handled efficiently and professionally from the first call I made to them to enquirie about the vehicle to travelling 100 miles to visit the showroom and road test the car.

I live in Sussex and so David provided me with a very useful personalised video showing the condition and features of the car. When I arrived I found it to be every bit as good as the video and bought it there and then. David organised all of the pre-purchase checks, valeting of the car, car tax and a full tank of petrol to get me home.

The whole process was efficient and courteous and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Swindon Audi and David in particular."
3/29/17,5,"Simon was very helpful, any question we had he was happy to help.

He kept me updated with videos when the car arrive and when it was ready to collect.

On the day of collect he went through any question i had and spent time with me going through all the different options in the car.

Overall I was very happy and would go back to Audi in Cawley"
3/29/17,5,Took my car in for a service and MOT. Staff were welcoming and very efficient. All work completed on time and to a high standard at a reasonable price.
3/29/17,5,"I recently visited Inchcapeaudi to part exchange my Audi A3 manual car for an Audi A1 Automatic. The sales executive, James Matthews, was extremely helpful and professional. From start to finish, James kept me informed and gave me good advice. When I arrived to collect my brand new Audi A1, James went through all the procedures for the new car with me so that I would not feel so daunted when driving it away for the first time. My whole experience with Audi at Tunbridge Wells was very relaxing. James, if your read this, you will go far. I enjoyed doing business with you."
3/28/17,5,"I would like to say as to how pleased I was with the service provided by Hannah Smith at your Crawley Branch. Hannah really provided a professional service and enabled this purchase of my new Audi Q3 to be as easy for me as possible which I really appreciated especially given that all correspondence was exchanged via Email and telephone as I could not visit the office in person. Fantastic Car, and a fantastic service which I hope will continue throughout the course of my three year lease."
3/28/17,5,"My wife popped in to pick up her vehiclr from a service. She decided to speak with Roger and after a good 4 hours had purchased herself a new vw golf. She loved the 'no time wasting' service Roger offered that we went back a few days later together and purchased a vw polo too. Even when we changed our minds on certain specs of the vehicle, Roger made the change possible and presented us our cars on Valentine's day. Definately recommend you to go see Roger Pacey today!!!"
3/28/17,5,"I have made two visits to Audi Tunbridge Wells in the past week. The first to have my TT MOTd, the second to collect a new A3. On both occasions my requirements were handled with professionalism, although I have to say collecting a new car was far more exciting than having an MOT. I have only complementary comments to make regarding both visits and I hope my association with Inchcape Audi will continue for a long time."
3/27/17,5,Very happy with the whole process.
3/27/17,5,"Excellent experience buying our new Audi from Inchcape Swindon. Pleasant showroom environment, warm greeting, hot coffee, knowledgeable sales personnel. Every effort made to accommodate us with a test drive and to discuss options available (for the car, for finance, and for after-sales support/insurance).
Very pleased with the car and with the overall buying process, and would recommend to anyone looking for a change of car."
3/27/17,5,"We came here 3 months prior to our visit last week to buy our first TT S line and we were that happy with the customer service and professionalism of Phil we came back and bought another before the new changes in vehicle tax came into affect.

Defo will be happy to deal with this dealership ongoing."
3/27/17,5,"I have used Inchcape Southend for the past 12 years and have always found them to offer excellent, reasonably priced service. Whlist they are not the cheapest, I know that when parts are needed they are genuine VW parts. Each time the car goes in for service it is thoroughly cleaned and polished inside and out. And I feel you get what you pay for! I would definitely recommend them to others."
3/27/17,5,"We had the emissions updated on our Audi Q5 , and was looked after by David who did an excellent job in making the trip hassle free, much appreciated.
Regards
Simon"
3/27/17,5,Purchased my new Audi and was looked after by Lee Machin. Excellent service and really looked after me. Love my new car. Thank you Lee !!
3/26/17,5,"Found Max a delight to deal with and such a contrast to some dealerships people.
I had penned a spec for the car last year but thought I would use my old car through the winter and buy in Feb/March.
Previous experiences with my wife's XK8 were with Taggarts and Park of Ayr and neither were particularly satisfactory, indeed the Taggart experience was the worst of any buying encounter and I have owned over 14 cars to date.
Max did precisely what he was asked and said he would and made the purchase a pleasure, such that your company and Max would be an automatic choice for my next acquisition."
3/26/17,5,"My visit to Inchape Volkswagen Twickenham certainly exceeded my expectations,from arrival to departure. My Polo TSI was booked in for it's first service to be carried out while I waited.Great customer service from all involved during my visit.Will be back again for the next service!"
3/25/17,5,having had the new car for three weeks we have found it to be very good all round and the dealership take care of you and listen to your wants and needs in general look after you we can highly recommend cooper York just ask for Tom Hinchlife and you will be pleased as we are
3/25/17,4,"Admittidly it was a short notice booking but no availabilty of transpot/lift drops a star. They did however return the vehicle to me by midday. Otherwise, all very professional and worth 5 stars."
3/24/17,5,We slways use a service plan for the above but this time emission modifcation done at same time. Car pick up and redelivery due to time required perfect communication before and on the day. Good service would recommend
3/24/17,5,"Quick and easy to make the booking, greeted by friendly staff and kept completely informed during my time at the garage"
3/24/17,5,"We dealt via Claire Miller, she was very patient, helpful and kept us fully informed. I used the youraudi site so I kept up to date with the car's assembly and progress to Emden and then to Sheerness.
Altogether a very informative and interesting process which I fully enjoyed."
3/24/17,5,"from the time you go for a look , have a chat , discuss your options and take delivery of your new car is done in a friendly professional manner with no pressure and a relaxed atmosphere ."
3/23/17,3,shock when looked at online report to say cambelt is due at a pricey sum! Not had the car 6 months and no mention of this whilst at the dealership. Off-putting comes to mind.
3/23/17,5,"This is our second car from Audi Stockport, the service is second to none,
David Willis who we requested for the second time dealt with our request
We are now the proud owners of the Audi Q3 black edition, David is very professional, he is very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions
we would have no doubts recommending Inchcapeaudi at Stockport.
Thank you David you deserve 6 but the rating only goes up to 5!!!!!!"
3/23/17,5,Mark and Harley at Tunbridge Wells were helpful and knowledgable with excellent customer service.
3/23/17,1,"Absolutely terrible service from Maidstone Audi. I took my S1 to have a minor oil change service as part of the service plan.

They managed to not fit an air flow pipe and did not fit the oil filler cap back correctly. On the way home from the garage the dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree with warning lights.

After the AA technician identified and corrected the incompetent work he commented that it was lucky the oil filler cap did not come away completely as this could have resulted in a catastrophic loss of oil.

Naturally I have complained to the garage but at present they have not even bothered to get back to me.

If you have an Audi in the Maidstone area please avoid Inchcape Maidstone Audi."
3/23/17,5,"Can not fault anything with this garage. All the staff are first class, and the young lady on the service reception is BRILLIANT.
Thank you"
3/23/17,5,"Excellent service, greeted by Becky for service. Came back to clean smart car ready to go! All good."
3/23/17,5,Both my VW Golf which was in for its first service and myself... were looked after brilliantly...everything was explained including timescales.. a video of the actual service details was produced by the technician to show me everything they saw / found.. and discussed in detail when I went to collect...Would highly recommend !
3/23/17,5,"Excellent experience ahead of actually receiving the car by being kept up to speed on timings through frequent calls from my BMW contact. On the day of delivery - taken through all aspects of the car systems, clear information about future service requirements and a personal contact in case of any questions."
3/23/17,5,"Arranged for car to be collected from my work place - 07:30 and delivered back to me the same day - no hassle in having to drop car off myself and I was kept informed of work being carried out.
Efficient, hassle free MOT"
3/23/17,5,"Excellent experience from start to finish. Never knew buying a car could be so much fun.
Knowledgeable staff who understood what my needs were and put together an excellent package at a really good price!
No hesitation in recommending them - definitely worth a visit - Ask for Becky!
Mini Cooper S Countryman All 4 - well delighted!"
3/23/17,5,Very helpful and efficient staff and service at Cooper BMW Croydon.
3/23/17,2,"Had my car in for a Service two weeks ago. I requested a Valuation to be done while they had it for the service. I was told that was fine and was even given the card of the Salesman who would carry out the Valuation.

I left the car with them all day and upon collection I enquired about the valuation. I was told the Salesman would contact me..... Why would they need to contact me I wondered, other than this being an excuse to not provide a valuation.

I waited a week and then contacted Teesside BMW about this matter, I received a swift reply from Andrew the Supervisor who copied and pasted this in his generic reply ""It’s very important to me and my team that the service you have received is to the highest standard""... and ""Be rest assured I will contact sales and ask them to contact you direct""

Well here we are, another full week since that email reply and still nothing from Cooper BMW.

Bottom line is, don't believe a word they tell you and take their ""highest standard customer service"" with a pinch of salt..."
3/22/17,5,"It's always a pleasure to visit the Mercedes dealership in Stratford upon Avon . Staff there have the rare ability to make everyone feel special .
Only one pitfall and that's the parking . There just isn't enough spaces .
But well done anyway ."
3/22/17,4,Adrian worked really hard to change my perception
3/22/17,5,My car was collected on time by a very pleasant employee of Mercedes. Service was good and car was spotless when returned by your driver. Thank you
3/22/17,5,I'm Very Satisfied
3/22/17,5,I decided to purchase my vw via an internet site who directed me to Inchecape. They were not the cheapest offer but they were nearby. The whole process of purchase and delivery were first class. When the site was Dane previously the service and attitude was poor. I found the sales executive helpful knowledgeable and pleasant.
3/22/17,5,Vehicle was collected and returned as outlined. Service carried out accordingly. Whole experience was trouble free! Thank you.
3/22/17,5,"From the initial booking onwards the garage confirmed and carried out the service as promised.
They arranged a taxi back and to the garage at short notice .
The car was cleaned and ready on arrival, the invoice explained and any advisories noted.
The only little gripe I have was that a minor issue with a squeaking window was not addressed,even though I had mentioned it initially.
Next time perhaps!
All in all, excellent service at a reasonable price."
3/22/17,5,Excellent customer service
3/22/17,5,Another professional service experience with excellent communication throughout. Thank you.
3/22/17,5,"Great service from Sales, I obtained prices first of Car wow and the dealership matched the best offer received, they went through everything on offer and the handover was excellent on vehicle collection"

3/22/17,5,"I was lucky enough to have a new car this year and i couldn't have chosen better than Hunters Derby.
The salesman ( Lewis Parker ) was very helpful, he was not pushy and listened! Most of all he was very professional and approachable. A friend of my husband told us to stay clear of Hunters , however I'm not the sort of person to jump on band wagons, i like to make my own mind up and I'm very glad i did. I would most definitely be going back to see Lewis in a few years time to "" upgrade "". Many thanks Lewis, you are very much a credit to your company, and i love my new car. Mrs Jenny Parkin"
3/22/17,5,Had to take the car in at short notice as had a puncture. Very helpful and understanding.

What more can I say."
3/21/17,5,Professional service all round
3/21/17,5,"I was very anxious with all the problems my car was dsiplaying and thought I was facing a huge bill. I took the car to Coopers of Croydon and I was pleasantly surprised. My service representative was Peter Cohen who from the very beginning of our conversation ensured me that most of the problems would be put right under the enhancements warranty and would not cost me anything. His manner was calm and reassuring and he gave me the good news that everything was sorted and tested at no cost to me. I conveyed my thanks and praise to Steve Keney, head of the service department and told him what a splendid service I had received. I have no hesitation in going back to Coopers for my next service and MOT and highly recommending them for excellent and honest service.

3/21/17,5,"Joey Foster was the poor guy who was deputed to look after my transaction. He was impressive: personable, helpful, polite and resourceful, and I enjoyed his company. (Excellent entertainment value.)
Oh!...........and I was very satisfied with the deal!"
3/21/17,5,"Excellent customer services, sales executive had good knowledge of product"
3/21/17,5,I wish all customer service could be as good as Inchcapeaudi in Tetbury. From the car purchase with Stephen to my recent visit for a service (thanks Sarah) they have always gone the extra mile to make things easy.
3/20/17,5,Car buying is usually a chore but this time it was almost pleasurable. Product is good and the process was done as quickly which was a real bonus. The sales rep was really personable and worked long hours to find the right deal and make everything run smoothly
3/20/17,5,"Sealand road garage recently purchased VW golf staff second to none helpful, friendly, and very informative, nothing was too much trouble dealt with sales person Colin who was most helpful would definitely recommend to family and friends overall a very pleasant experience"
3/20/17,4,I received a great deal on a new A6 Allroad Sport. A great discount on the price and very competitive finance terms. Sales Service was very smooth from selecting the car and picking up one week later including arranging the finance.

Many Thanks to all at Bolton Audi

3/20/17,1,"Took my 4 year old A4 in for MOT on Saturday, have noticed an Email asking me to review my experience here so I'll copy and paste from the review I wrote on their Facebook page.

Have had great service here previously and reported that on twitter (which they quickly retweeted and liked) but today noticed on MOT history webpage when checking if it has been completed yet that car had MOT advisories for both rear tyres being ""worn close to the legal limit"". Audi Cam footage shows minimum tread depth find of 4.6mm. Legal limit is 1.6mm. New tyres are 7-8mm. Make your own mind up about that. Service centre staff weren't in any way interested in listening to my complaint when I pointed this out, failing to grasp the contradiction of Audi Cam evidence and phantom advisories. That changed when I mentioned I'd Email James Brearley (CEO of Inchcape) and VOSA regarding negligence when I got home. Have done that now and look forward to their responses. Can't comment on what they're like for sales as bought elsewhere but would steer clear for service/MOT if you value your motor's MOT reputation or if you don't want to deal with incompetence.

As a footnote, despite an Email acknowledgement from the CEO's PA that this will be dealt with by the Head of Business at Bolton Audi who will call me ""shortly"", I'm yet to hear anything almost a full working day later. VOSA have been supportive and directed me to lodge a formal complaint which they'll investigate accordingly with Inchcape Bolton Audi service / MOT dept and take appropriate action subsequently."
3/20/17,5,Travelled over 130 miles to buy my new car from Crawley Audi. Hannah Smith that dealt with me is fantastic. Everything is dealt with professionally and efficiently.
3/20/17,5,"Efficient service , courteous, great garage"
3/20/17,1,Booked my car for a rectification and MOT. Failed MOT as indicator lamps where flashing red in places on one side where bulbs had gone. Advised I had to have both lamp units replaced not just the one that failed at a cost of £364. Only explanation why I had to have both done was that they could affect each other. Totally unacceptable and they took advantage of the fact I was a woman and expected me to just pay. Will be having one lamp replaced and getting MOT elsewhere and then claiming my money back. Appalling behaviour in this day and age!! Also car broke down day after due to rectification work and I had to call the AA. Do not go to this garage!
3/20/17,5,"Great job at Tetbury Audi !
I would always recommend them

3/20/17,2,"Ordered a new GLC AMG in blue with leather seats over 6 weeks ago, my wife was due to collect the vehicle on Friday March 17, 2017 from Mercedes Warrington however, an hour before my wife was due to leave to collect the car she receives a call to say it’s the wrong colour and no leather seats (basically the wrong car). My wife was then informed the vehicle that had come in stock is of a higher specification and would my wife like to at least look at the wrong car. My wife reluctantly agreed to this and arrived at the dealership today March 20, 2017, unfortunately my wife was not happy with the colour or the manmade leather trim. Only when my wife asked for a refund of our deposit did the salesman say let me speak to my manager and see if we can get the correct car in. Surely this should have been the first port of call in order to find the correct car that was ordered. My wife runs her own business and i work abroad, my wife does not have the time to be backwards and forwards to the dealership and the numerous phones calls.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION INDEX = ZERO

3/20/17,5,"Took my Evoque in for it's first MOT.
I had a very nice courtesy car (Landrover discovery Sport)
While the vehicle was in it was noticed that the service was almost due, they found that I had a service warranty so decided to carry out a service at the same time.
All carried out to a very high standard, the car was washed and valeted on completion.
My thanks to Louis Moore.."
3/20/17,5,Good choice of used vehicles prepared to a high standard. Knowledgeable sales team without being pushy. Good atmosphere in showroom.
3/20/17,5,Friendly helpful staff. The electronic check list and video was brilliant too sent straight to my mobile phone. Car went in at 0830hrs and was ready by 1030hrs.

3/20/17,5,"Recently purchased a 65 plate A5 trading in an Audi TTS !
Right from the initial phonecall to Audi the whole experience was dealt with competency, efficiency, and a professional manner. I was given what I wanted for my car as a trade in and I also got money knocked off the new car. I work offshore so the deal was done over the phone and email which was perfect for me. The car was delivered to me with the new car having a full valet and a full tank of fuel. I can't recommend these people anymore it was the easiest car exchange I've ever done. I would definitely come back to this dealer for another upgrade. Special thanks to Scott Dowen, he made the whole deal run swiftly and completed on time
Excellent service all round
Thank you !"
