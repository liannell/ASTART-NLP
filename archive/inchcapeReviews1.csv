2023-05-09,1,"The garage refused to investigate a warrantee fault whilst my vehicle was in for its first service. Further more, it is now a six week wait to book it in with the provision of a curtesy car. The garage don't offer any means of transport for customers to a place of work or home, whilst they retain the car for a full day."
2023-05-25,5,George Eden was fantastic. A pleasure to deal with. Communicated with me throughout the process and even offered me a courtesy car because my new car was delayed. I will definitely be recommendinf friends and family to mercedes
2023-05-23,1,"Extremely poor service from Sandhurst Inchcape. Very rude and cold manager, not willing to negotiate anything or provide the fantastic customer service I have always received and expected from Toyota. We had gone into the branch to purchase a car today to be told it had gone up when it was still listed the same online. They tried to rush us into buying it and said another person was about to and we needed to compete. Will never visit again. Went to Jemca this afternoon and had a far better experience !"
2023-05-19,5,"As always I have had a very satisfying visit to Inchcape Toyota in Derby. Their people are friendly, efficient, understanding and never pressurising. This was the fourth car I have bought from them and the service is always consistent. I paid another unexpected visit two days later on a Sunday to try and find out how to disable the alarm. Their representative on duty knew exactly what to do and yet again I left happy. You may get a similar service from other dealers but when the car is great, the price is great and the service is great.........why go anywhere else?"
2023-05-18,5,The customer agent Brook was superb. I found both her and her manager very professional knowledgeable and enjoyable to deal with. Highly recommend this dealership. I'll be back and worth the distance. We'll done and thank you for a great customer experience. Richard
2023-05-19,1,"The very long wait for my car to be delivered. As it took 15 months longer then planned to deliver a car ordered in 2021 for delivery around March 2022. Throughout the whole delay due to no fault of my own not once was any compensation or gesture of good will offered for the delay. This will probably be the last car I get from Inchcape, having in the past purchased 2 Polo, Golf, Up and 2 Tiguan."
2023-05-19,5,"Inchcape Toyota North Nottingham NG6 0AA
I went to leave my car to change the internal light, great service both times I went and the car came back fixed and very clean. Congratulations to all for the wonderful service."
2023-05-13,5,"Our car went in for a major service, we were kept updated throughout the day by text/ email, and then when the car was ready to be collected. Very informative and helpful."
2023-05-08,5,"Great experience, friendly and helpful team. They managed to show me the car and take me for test drive without pre-booked appointment, no question was too much. I left the dealership with signed purchase. Part exchanged my old car and collected the new one weak later. Easy and quick handover. I can highly recommend Inchcape Toyota Sandhurst basis on my positive experience."
2023-05-23,5,"Elliot

Sold my Jaguar with very few hiccups all of which Elliot sorted out straight away

2023-05-09,1,"First (and last) time having to deal with Inchcape Audi Stockport.
Having waited almost a year for the car we required we struggled to find out about delivery with no lead time given.
When it finally had arrived the night before collection the vehicle was amongst a number vandalised on site. Ours being the worst as it was left unlocked! Druggies had been in it using drugs and with a dog. Damage done meant we had to reject the vehicle.
Not even a phone call - we received an email that very fortunately we saw just minutes before our current vehicle was being collected.
We have incurred costs, inconvenience, stress, poor communication throughout and are now back to square one in ordering another vehicle - yet the dealership wouldn’t even discuss face to face and passed our complaint to head office and all we’ve had is scripted answers.
Having read numerous other poor reviews we now feel we’ve had a lucky escape from this company.

Inchcape response below and elsewhere keeps mentioning “secure area”. Obviously not - a number of vehicles were damaged and ours was left unlocked - I don’t think anyone would regard that as secure!"
2023-04-10,5,"I purchased a used car from Cheshire Oaks Audi, the service was excellent from start to finish."
2023-05-20,5,"Simple, easy and quick - exactly the way I like to buy a car. Stuart at Southport Mercedes was great to deal with, he managed to get everything sorted and the deal was done ✅ - thank you for a great sale"
2023-04-18,1,"Failed home delivery twice , salesperson failed to deliver on what was promised at sale . Would not buy from that branch ever again"
2023-05-23,5,"Had a service @ Landrover, Chester yesterday YD66NYU dealt with Rebecca who was first class from start to finish. Well done!"
2023-05-12,4,"Sold a car in the past couple of weeks - Inchcape gave best valuation of several online car buying sites. Vehicle originally came from Inchcape anyway and ended up being returned to same dealer as purchased from, so I do not know if that had a more favourable impact on the whole process. Quite a lot of to and fro contact with the Buyer, and my queries about the process were answered quickly enough and with a good level of assistance. I was hesitant about the online process and verification for payment, due to some conflicts of info on website and buyer. However all was resolved. Dropped car off at dealer and payment was issued the same day once the car was checked over. I would use this service again. Thanks to JV for his assistance."
2023-05-12,5,"Dominic is an excellent Mercedes salesman who goes above and beyond for his customers. He is knowledgeable, patient, transparent, and dedicated to providing exceptional customer service. I highly recommend him to anyone in the market for a Mercedes."
2023-05-05,5,"Very delighted with my recent visit at Cheshire Oaks Audi. Colin the senior service advisor looked after me and my car, Colin has looked after my car on a number of visits and is always professional, and informative as well as always providing an excellent experience whenever bringing my vehicle in. Colin always goes above and beyond!"
2023-05-12,4,"Booking in process for MOT and Service very easy, arrival and handover straightforward. On return for collection was welcomed with a nice drink from reception staff THANKYOU. I’ve marked them down one star because
1. I had asked for my stop start to be checked as I’ve noticed it’s not coming on. I wasn’t updated on this and I felt un listened too,
2. As a long standing customer of Mercedes I’ve grown used to my car getting a valet whilst there. And on this occasion my car was not done! So feeling under valued by this company."
2023-05-02,5,"I recently sold a car using Inchcape Group Used Car buying service, Inchcape had serviced and maintained the car so knew the vehicle's history. The ""sell my car"" buyer was very helpful in guiding me through the process, was supportive when I had issues to resolve with DVLA and arranged collection of the vehicle when the road fund tax had been cancelled. I received a fair price and payment immediately. The buyer I dealt with made what could have been an extremely stressful situation manageable for me and I would recommend this service."
2023-02-16,1,"Twice they tried to give me a car with a faulty gearbox and lied about sending it to be fixed. Told me to sell my van privately so i get more money then they offered as a px, so now ive got my refund from Inchcape i have no vehicle!"
2023-05-18,5,Excellent service throughout especially by Customer Services. My Golf GTI was collected and returned on time by the Service Manager so I was confident it was in safe hands.
2023-05-12,4,"The service I received was excellent from Will

I would have given 5 stars but there was an elements of confusion in communication where figures were quoted based on the polo"
2023-05-18,3,"Car went in with two issues - brakes - straightforward - indicator volume level less so.
Investigation of the latter seems to be limited to 'the computer says not resolved and no recommendations for further action"
2023-05-03,5,"My car was collected by a very pleasant and professional man. He went through what was being done and said he would also report an issue that we hadn’t made the service dept aware of, which they very kindly rectified at no extra cost. The car was cleaned and valeted to a high standard and I can’t fault the service I received. The car was returned to me later the same day."
2023-05-04,1,"Inchcape supplied a VW E-Up in December 2022 and when it was delivered there were 2 parts missing.
The unique part that clips onto the dashboard to hold a mobile device was not supplied and neither was the device connection cable ( this small part would not have been an issue)
Despite numerous emails, Inchcape have been unable to fulfil the order for the missing parts.
It's not possible to fit a generic part because nothing exists.
After 5 months of waiting they are still unable to provide a delivery date.
Incredibly appalling service without any apology from Inchcape."
2023-05-10,1,"Very disappointing. Had BMWs for many years.
Took my car in to Colchester branch after a recall 31st March… when I collected it, it had a fault indicator that they said was a result of a software upgrade.
It wasn’t!
They had actually left a temp sensor disconnected from the manifold (diagnosed by a local independent garage)
When I contacted them their response was excuses and frankly lies.
Now I know we all make mistakes.. but for heavens sake by big, own up and swallow your over inflated pride.
Never ever again!
Question is ….where (if at all) do I purchase my next BMW? as this company seems to have the franchise with in my locality!


Follow Up:
That reply re-enforces the content of my main review.
Weak words and a total failure to own up and make any attempt to make amends.
Not enough to alter my intention to move away from BMW’s…."
2023-05-03,5,"Extremely happy with the helpful service when buying my new Lexus.

I have been a Lexus customer for many years and the team at Lexus Guildford are brilliant, so thank you all.
Especially Carl who was very patient and knowledgeable, helping me make my decision to buy my new vehicle."
2023-04-28,5,"I’ve bought 3 cars from inchscape Chester and they never fail to deliver excellent customer service, they really look after you through the whole process. Staff went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with everything as we went along, thanks guys! You’re never left waiting for long, everything is fully explained , there’s no hard sell techniques and the late (coffee) is lovely!!
Would definitely go back again! 😊"
2023-03-29,5,"I bought a used VW at the end of March and experienced a few issues with the vehicle that only came to light after the sale. I'm pleased to say that the team were very helpful and worked to resolve them in a timely manner. I'm extremely happy with the end result. Many thanks to all those involved, especially Kimberley, Jamie and Thomas."
2023-05-17,5,Alex as been very helpful (I had to isolate with covid) and he got the car ready for me I would like to thank all involve
2023-05-22,5,"I visited Mercedes-Benz of North Wales to purchase an approved used Mercedes , The sales executive who I dealt with was very knowledgable and helpful and made the whole process really easy and hassle free , so far I am pleased with the whole process and would like to thank Jake Davies for his assistance and professionalism"
2023-03-09,3,"I am not sure where to start on this and my chronology of events is interesting and starts on 9th March when the car was taken in due to a malfunction in the gearbox to the 22nd April when I was able to finally collect the car - issues were due to the war in Ukraine and Brexit apparently, but thankfully this was all under warranty.

I started off with two stars as the communication was terrible, but upgraded halfway through typing this to three due to the fact that the one person their (or it felt like there was only one person who would come back to me) was briliant and did what she could to help me. So Tanya, thank you for all that you did for me and giving me one of your cars for six weeks.

Thank you!"
2023-05-10,1,"Dropped my car off at 08:15 for an inspection of the front shock absorbers and to look into a EPC issue. Was told by the service advisor I should expect a call in the afternoon. I ended up calling them at 3:45pm to find out what was happening with the car. The EPC issue was resolved with a software update. Both shock absorbers were confirmed to be leaking by the technicians and was mark as advisories on the health check sheet. The car is in warranty but apparently the leak isn’t bad enough to be deemed a warranty failure yet according to the service administrator.

Don’t understand how the technician is advising I change the parts but the administrator is refusing to replace them under warranty. In the mean time I am left with a car with faults that could be dangerous and VW warranty that isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.

Still waiting on a call back from Thursday the 11th regarding the issues. Called on the 12th to chase was told by one member of staff that the warranty doesn’t cover me damaging the vehicle no idea how I would damage the shock absorbers. He transferred me to a lady who said everything is sorted and will be fix on the 26th. Email confirmation she sent mentioned nothing of the parts being replaced under warranty. Called back to be told they will call me on Monday. It’s Wednesday morning now and a still not contact from anyone at VW.

The level of service is embarrassing I spent a lot of money on a car with you to be ignored when the car develops faults. I wouldn’t give you any stars if possible. Feel free to contact me if you can be bothered."
2023-02-08,1,"Nothing but issues with this dealership. No one calls you back, they don't fix issues and say they have...Held our car ransom until another Audi dealer paid. The worst customer service received by a dealership!
I have already given a previous review and Inchcape replied asking me for more detail, which I have done and heard nothing! Why bother asking for feedback when you do nothing about it anyway!"
2023-04-28,5,"I dealt with the Norwich branch and from my first call with Sophie Tudor, nothing was too much trouble. I had a very specific spec of mini I wanted and she helped me through the whole process and delivered the car personally. There was no hard sell, just personable and knowledgeable service.
I am super happy with my car and would definitely make Sophie my first call for any future car purchases."
2023-04-27,3,"I just realised that the recent check up of my car (major) is include the battery change for my keyfobs, if I realised this early or been told by the time I requested the battery changing job in Feb, I would rather wait to do that together with my car major check up in April. That could save me £16.50 and the time as well. My refund requested refused. Other than that, overall experience is well."
2023-04-27,5,"Sales team not great at getting back but service manager was excellent . , once under his control .Subage Athwal was excellent and sorted everything out for my Mum Vw Up. Nathan Edwards was thorough
In checking the car, thank you
Nathan .
Very happy with service department same standard as audi."
2023-04-28,2,"Intermittent fault on fron sensor of the car. Garage checked cars computer and found no fault, did not appear to have examined the car, apart from cleaning the sensor and did not drive the car. Sensor going off in garage car park. Said there was nothing else they could, despite the fact this fault caused a great deal of aggravation because of the noise"
2023-04-27,5,"I had recently had a difficult time with a Nissan electric car, and Motability had allowed me to swap my vehicle. I called in as the C-HR was the vehicle I nearly chose last year, but the Leaf had won out. I met Mark and found him extremely knowledgeable, professional, and helpful. He is a great ambassador for the company. As I was flexible over colour, he managed to get me a vehicle very quickly. I am still waiting for some of the competitors, including the Nissan dealer, to call me back and I am driving my new car! Thank you so much! Special thanks to Mark!!"
2023-04-22,5,"just bought my new car from Mercedes Liverpool. Staff couldn't be more helpful. Will, who sold me the car couldn't do any more for me, so organised, knowledgeable. always in contact throughout the purchase. finance manager was really helpful and pressed to get the best deal for myself. could not recommend highly enough for the Gents who dealt with me. Would defiantly recommend using Mercedes Liverpool to purchase from."
2023-04-27,5,"My car was booked in to check on an engine warning light that had come on. I was kept up to date of the appointment with videos of my car being checked and informed of the problem found. It was quickly fixed and I also opted to have my wiper blades replaced and an oil top up! Also a complimentary car clean. Very reasonably priced and all the work carried out within a few hours. All the staff were lovely and welcoming and Adam, who handled my appointment, was so polite and friendly! Made me feel relaxed and welcome. Highly recommend Inchscape Manchester, my car came back clean and purring like a kitten! 😁"
2023-04-23,5,"We have bought many cars from Inchcape Nottingham and have never been disappointed. Yugesh has always been fantastic and nothing is ever too much trouble. The process has always been so easy and hassle free.
Brilliant customer service Yugesh. A 10 out of 10 every time.
If you could bottle his enthusiasm you would be worth a fortune!
With thanks and best wishes.
Chris Sedgwick"
2023-04-26,1,"Great informative service from Jas at used car sales desk, but that’s where the good service ended. A very arrogant sales manager struggling to admit their mistakes. My car was delivered in a poor state, unfinished, dirty inside out, with additional mileage on the clock since we agreed the deal. Absolutely shocking service. Despite promises to reimburse me for valeting, three weeks on and I still have not heard back from MB Stratford and not yet refunded as promised. I would avoid this dealership if I were you."
2023-03-30,5,"Swindon Audi completed an Oil and Inspection Service on my car to the high standards that you expect when running an Audi.
All staff were friendly and professional throughout the booking process and visit. Quite enjoyable really.
The Audi Cam video was informative and professionally captured, a nice touch - thank you."
2023-04-25,5,"Keith Edwards made my experience e pleasant one. He was as attentive and helpful as ever.
I picked up my new yaris and completed the paperwork easily. I didn't feel pressured into extras however I was informed of my options."
2023-05-02,5,"Absolutely fantastic service! All of the staff were extremely professional and polite. I was kept up to date with how things were going with the car, and just found the whole experience very positive."
2023-05-22,5,I have sold my car quickly and without any hassle. Inchcape manager was very helpful and friendly.
2023-05-12,5,"This was a nice and easy way to sell my car, entered some details on their webpage, received a call from the team to confirm the details. The cash was in my bank straight after I took it to the dealer. A great service."
2023-04-18,5,"Travelled down from North Yorkshire to this dealership with 2 other cars in mind at other dealerships. I conducted the business with both Jack and George, and found them to be both pleasant and professional. We agreed on prices and the deal started. I am pleased to say that the transaction went through seamlessly. I was sorry to see my old car go, but am overjoyed with my new purchase. Well done guys and thank you to you both for looking after us. Would definately consider a further purchase from Inchcape Leicester."
2023-05-04,5,Excellent service and friendliness from all staff. My car was given back to me on time and was cleaned inside and out. This is not the first time that I get this service from them. I will definitely tell my friends and family and most definitely bring my wife's car to them as well. If I could rate a 6 star I would. Well done Mercedes Stratford-upon-Avon. 👏
2023-04-24,5,After visiting all the other car sale showrooms in the are we found that the Mercedes Garage and Gary were by far the best. He made me feel like a valued customer and did everything to make buying my new car an easy experience
2023-04-21,3,"Log book was not filled in or stamped. It’s one of the main reasons for getting it done at the dealership; phoned & sent a message afterwards, was told someone would contact me but still nothing. Check in and out was smooth otherwise.
Report of car assessment (with options to choose further services if assessed as lacking) was sent over an hour after the message that the car was ready to collect.
I asked at the time of booking and when checking in the car, about the upholstery cleaning cover I purchased with the car. I was told this would be sorted with the Sales team but it has been radio silence and no upholstery cleaning took place."
2022-10-24,1,"Left a previous review and although I was promised to have the issues fixed I am still waiting...
Someone called me but never followed through on the promises made with regards to addressing and resolving the issues....
April 27th 2023 and still nothing...
Avoid them at all cost!"
2023-05-04,5,Able to make the appointment quickly (days rather than months) and well looked after on the day. Able to work from the dealership rather than have to leave and come back.
2023-05-05,5,"Excellent! Brilliant price for my car, easy process and picked up efficiently!
Would highly recommend and Joe was brilliant!"
2023-05-04,5,Excellent service can’t fault them
2023-04-21,5,"toyota guildford -
Customer service was excellent from booking to drop off and pick up. Simon in the service department (?) was polite, professional and personable. Explained what was to happen on the day, how long it would take and then phoned me when work complete explaining what had been done etc. All highly satisfactory and level of customer service i expect from Toyota and (frankly) why i return again and again for service, repairs etc. despite you being significantly more expensive than my local garage."
2023-04-25,5,"Edward, Peter and Monteiro did an excellent job. I couldn’t be happier with my choose to buy from Toyota. Well done for all of them. Excellent customer service."
2023-05-22,5,Great professional service from initial submission to completion. Would recommend. Thank you Joseph Vaughan
2023-04-11,5,I have recently bought a new car on a PPC trading my C-HR for a Yaris X. Charles Jourdaan was my sales representative who was faultless throughout the procedure. As my car hadn’t arrived on the due date he arranged a coutesy car for me to use (as my car needed its first MOT) until my Yaris X arrived. He kept me updated throughout the whole time and was extremely polite annd courteous and very knowledgeable about all aspects of my new car at the handover. He’s certainly an asset to Inchcape Warrington.
2023-04-05,1,"It took five phone calls to get a minor fault fixed on my F-type Jaguar' just a faulty windscreen washer. Two staff members were very argumentative and unhelpful on the phone, offering nothing but excuses. This was a recurring fault from the last service. They did eventually fix it, when I pointed out it was an MOT fail. A backstreet garage could have done better."
2023-04-18,5,"I must say selling a car to Bravoauto was extremely easy and hassle free. The used car buying team were efficient and gave me a Better price than webuyanycar, cazoo or motorway. The paper work was easy and settlement was paid of quickly. A special mention to Elliot lake for his great service! I f you have a car to sell give these professionals a call."
2023-04-23,5,"Gary went above and beyond to help me with everything that I asked him.
It made my experience an absolute success.
I would highly recommend the dealership and especially Gary who is very knowledgeable."
2023-05-05,5,"It’s been a long time since I was impressed about a service, dealing with inchcape was the best every. Thanks to all who made this experience great and special thanks to Joseph Vaughan :)"
2023-05-02,5,"Speed and honesty.
No messing around, contacted me as the work was done.
And that's what I want, we need to be back on the road as soon as possible.
And that's what happened with me, and I appreciated this service. Thumbs-up"
2023-05-05,5,"Sold a Ford Ranger to Joseph. Great communication throughout and a seem less transaction. Barry who collected the vehicle was also very good.
Thanks
Jake"
2023-05-12,5,Car was collected and returned as agreed; was given excellent cost saving advice from staff
2023-04-15,5,Staff very helpful in fitting me in last minute for a tyre change and service after I was let down last minute by another Audi dealership due to staff shortages. I would make this my preferred dealership if it was closer.
2023-04-24,5,"I am so pleased with VW Stockport. My stone-guard had failed and was fowling the wheel. Ben booked me in the next day. I requested the car be fixed by 14:00 so I could take my autistic son out. Walking home Will rang saying the wheel nuts had been overtightened and wouldn’t come off. I may need a new hub. I cancelled all arrangements for the rest of the week.
Will later called, they had got the hub off and completed the work. Incredibly I was able to pick my car up on time. The work took Mike extra time so it cost more but far less tan a new hub.
I should like to thank Will and Ben (service colleagues) for understanding my needs going the extra mile, keeping me informed throughout. Special thanks to Mike (mechanic) for having the skill and making the effort to save my hub and get me back on the road remarkably ahead of schedule.
Brilliant work. Thank you, Simon."
2023-04-14,5,First class service. Contacted by Gavin very soon after I submitted my enquiry online to sell my vehicle. Inspection of my vehicle arranged soon after. Agreed sales price upheld and the funds were received into my bank account whilst I was still at the appointment. Couldn’t have asked for a better service!
2023-03-31,1,"We’ve (unfortunately) now had three very poor experiences with Swindon Audi. The experience begins with front desk staff who are busy playing with their phone or chatting to other members of staff. When they do finally look up and ask what you want they will direct you to someone else who also couldn’t give a toss. For servicing we were booked in only to arrive and be told that the service manager had gone on holiday and forgot to put our booking on the system (despite having a confirmation email..?!). One our second return journey the service took twice as long as expected because they were ‘busy’. Service completed and car returned without a valet (despite this being part of the service).
Comms are poor, staff are rude, jobs are half done. We won’t be returning and our experiences have tarnished our view of Audi."
2023-03-28,5,"We placed an order for a new Yaris Cross Excel in November 2022. We were expecting delivery late April however, the car arrived early. We were very competently helped by Josie Fowler who kept us informed with progress. We were supposed to pick up the car on the Tuesday but there were problems with the DVLA new car registration system. We were kept fully informed about the situation by a sales manager and were able to pick up the car at handover on the Wednesday. We have always been very pleased with all transactions with Inchcape Derby and would recommend them to anyone wishing to purchase new or used Toyota vehicles."
2023-05-12,5,"Smooth and helpful
Liked the review video of potential future service areas"
2023-04-08,5,"the best buying service i have every come accross in 40 years of driving, words cant sum up how they make you feel so special as customer and nothing is to much bother. the best service in the world!"
2023-04-08,1,"Made 2 enquiries via the Inchcape Warrington website but got no reply. Rang twice on option 5 but no answer.
Also wife took her car in for MOT and service and was told it had been washed and vacuumed inside - it hadn't. Has certainly gone to the dogs since changed from Bentleys."
2023-04-27,3,Great staff and service but unfortunately the problem was not fixed.
2023-03-30,5,"We found a cracked left mirror cover of my new purchase Mercedes-Benz when just pick up at the Juniper In, Warrington. But we immediately told the helpful staff Asha to follow up repair services of my new purchase car. Thank you so much for her attentive and excellent service. We'll without hesitation to recommend Asha is the best colleague in your company. Also Sale Manager Syed was very good listener and friendly. Syed introduced the suitable Mercedes-Benz to us. We are so happy with their services and we had purchased a good one 😍. Thank you so much !"
2023-04-21,1,"It absolutely pointless taking your car there to be repaired, they don’t listen and try to argue or deny anything they have done could be at fault.

Air con service only filled last June now empty and wanted to charge me another £135 to just look at it, but they tell me they can guarantee it’s got a leak, why not check that when it first came in before charging me to fill it to know it’s going to leak, so you can charge me another 135 to tell me it’s going to leak and then charge me to fix that and then charge me to fill it again?

No wonder Mercedes are losing customers by the thousands, daylight robbery at its finest!"
2023-04-24,5,Sold our Ford Focus through Bravoauto. Gavin made the whole process quick and easy with the car being picked up and the finances all sorted within hours. Thank you to Gavin for your help with selling our car!
2023-04-08,1,"Conflicting information given to me. In November 22, I was told that service was due and I booked my car for service and MOT. I was told that usb's in back rows are not working and will need £120 for diagnostics, which I didn't go ahead!
I got my car for brake disc and pad change on 8th April 2023, when I was told that service wasn't done in Nov 22, in spite of me booking for service as advised by EMAC. I was also told that USBs are working fine! I don't expect Land Rover to be stooping to this level to extract money from customers!!"
2023-04-29,5,What a great experience thank you for all your help Annie rose your a great asset to the garage you made it easy to buy my new car thank you
2023-04-21,5,Fantastic experience selling our BMW X1 SUV. We spoke to Holly who guided us all the way through and she was so helpful! Very grateful Holly for your caring attitude. Thank you so much. Excellent service.
2023-04-20,4,Customer service and servicing completed to my satisfaction. Only fault was I didn't get a call from the service department to let me know it had been completed and the car was ready for collection
2023-04-22,5,"Great choice of cars, friendly, professional employees not pushy in selling the cars. Provided alternative finance options.
Nice people to deal with"
2023-05-02,4,"They collected my car before 9am and returned it all serviced and MOT'd.

2023-05-16,1,"Time-Wasting 5 out of 5
Returning your car in a worse state than it comes in 5 out of 5
Honesty 0 out of 5
Communication TBC, you receive none


Where to start? I thought the receptionist referring to the service engineer as a half-wit when she’d forgotten to mute the phone was a little harsh. However, I realise it is a case of don't shoot the messenger and the staff here are caught up in the middle of this chaos day in day out.

A little background. I’ve been with the garage for over ten years. In that time I’ve had my car damaged while under their care three times. The first time they did significant paintwork damage to the fender. The second time they damaged the driver's door. When I highlighted the damage to the driver's door they performed a low cost ‘magic repair’. This consisted of a touchup and a new lacquer.

When I arrived to collect the car after a long period of silence, they wasted an hour of my time stalling while I saw a bodywork specialist leaving. The freshly lacquered door contained a larger chip than they’d previously fixed with no coating so could have only happened after the event. They admitted this mistake but offered a second magic repair as a remedy. This chip was sizeable and would require a respray to be returned to the original condition.

I had a breakdown right next to the garage so was forced to go to the same dealership again. They have an SLA for breakdowns to respond to the customer within 7 days. 2.5 weeks later I was without a car, holding a BMW warranty and in absence of any update whatsoever. After emailing and calling twice I was informed that the item was not covered and also due to it being an premium M Car there would need to be a larger repair (twice the size). The explanation for it not being covered by what was described as an after-market warranty (BMW’s extended warranty) was that there was significant corrosion to the suspension spring. I have all of the vehicle health check videos. They all refer to the suspension being good. The MOT has no advisory and suspension is a mandatory item for review. Yet the multiple thousand pounds worth of damage is not covered because of the corrosion (in under 3 months since MOT). I would like to hear from BWM what their SLA’s include with their warranty provider. I suspect they have hit their targets on refusing legitimate customers' repairs. Needless to say there is no repair to the bodywork inspite of requesting this be actioned while the vehicle was off the road. An email was missed due to annual leave, the same reason I was given for the last 4 emails regarding the bodywork damage that was made by the same dealership in the previous service. I feel like Out of Office notifications have been around for some time… perhaps as long as that excuse.

This garage is dysfunctional, unreliable and dishonest. If you value your car then I would recommend you go elsewhere and check the T&C’s of your BMW Warranty. If you like a cheap Latte and are happy having your time wasted then this is the place for you, I’d avoid the free wash though unless you’ve checked your paintwork before and after. PS. If you’re told your brand new wipers are corroded and need replacing that pays for a coffee elsewhere… or about half a Nespresso machine."
2023-03-28,1,"Inchcape Landrover Service @ Guildford, my car went in after breakdown and 5 x weeks later i got it back only to find that some problems were still there,
5 x weeks was bad enough, but all the chasing and lack of return calls, added to this when you are told that pre/booked appointments are a priority and breakdown will only be looked at when there are slots available dont go down well.
They are a shambles and should be avoided."
2023-04-21,5,"This was a great experience from start to finish. The online appraisal was very straightforward, expertly and professionally guided by my contact Elliot. There were no issues when I dropped the car off at the dealers, and Elliot even called me to check the payment had been processed successfully."
2023-04-22,3,"Car wise, I guess the service was good as it's VW. Lovely reception area waiting. Staff really nice. The only thing that disappointed me was I was told I'd get a free valet. The inside of my car wasn't bad, the boot needed a hoover and outside needed a clean. They totally ignored the boot and maybe popped a hosepipe over the car. I'd rather I was not offered the valet than feel the way I did. I will think twice about driving to Chester from Liverpool in the future and use a different franchise. Don't offer a service then do a bad job of it. I hope my car service didn't have the same lack of care."
2023-04-11,5,"Easy and quick check-in process. Courtesy car option was great. You did what you said you would do. My car returned to me on time, nice and clean. Friendly service throughout. Overall a professional and swift service, hassle free."
2023-04-26,5,"Purchase of my new car, both Jeff and Calum were excellent. Thank you, excellent service from this dealership."
2023-03-29,1,"Upon picking my vehicle up the person on reception went to the service office and returned with a envelope with my registration on it, opened it and tried to give me a key that was not mine. I told him that is not my key and he replied ""Yes it is"" dumbfounded by this i once again told him it was not my key. He then returned to the service office and then returned with my key. Then to add injury to insult i went to my vehicle to find one side of it covered in mud (Picture's can be supplied if needed) which wasn't the case when i dropped it off earlier that day. I think the way myself and my vehicle were treated that day totally unacceptable."
2023-04-29,5,"Michael looked after us from the start, very professional and offered us a good Part ex on our car.
He kept in touch and the car was presented well when we came to collect"
2023-03-31,2,"My vehicle was booked in for a service, repair to a door lock and to reattach the hose serving the rear washer to the bottom of the washer bottle on 31/03/2023. The service was completed, but they “ran out of time to deal with the other items”. The vehicle was left at the garage, as I was called down to London due to a family emergency. Today, 11 April, I was called and advised that the door locked had been repaired, but they had forgotten to rectify the simple fault with the rear washer. This is not the service I expect from a prestigious brand main dealer. Hopefully the remaining fault will be completed without further delay."

2023-03-30,5,I travelled 300 miles to pick up my lovely Peugeot 2008 GT line car and I can say that Marc Melcher who managed the sale and all the other staff were first class with their service.

2023-04-01,1,"Booked my vehicle in for a scheduled service (£850) agent didn’t seem to really have a clue what she was doing. I received a booking confirmation but it was for the wrong dealership. Called back to change and I had to confirm all my details again to be told they would call me back in 10 minutes. I cancelled the booking and rearranged at another dealer for £150.00 less, will never use again."
2023-03-24,5,The car I was part-exing had been hit & run the day before collecting new one so didn't expect to get new one but they were more than fair & made it possible for me to pick new one up same day. I wouldn't go anywhere else !!!

On the second booking (this booking) I was told to collect the car at 5pm which I promptly arrived for to then be left waiting 45 minutes for the car to be ready. The car was also booked in for a service but on arriving home I have found the computer on my car has not been updated so the car still states it needs a service. Is this going to require yet another return to the service centre? The online service history has also not been updated. I will not be using Inchscape Chester again."
2023-03-24,5,"Sean Nealon was our sales representative at Mercedes Leicester, he couldn't do enough for us, answering every question we asked, always at the end of the phone when we needed him (even on his day's off) and still been supportive after collecting our new car. I can rest assure that if there is anything I need, Sean will be more than happy to help, which is hard to come by that sort of service these day's"
2023-03-27,1,"Poor service and ridiculously high priced. Took me 10 times before I could get through to them, only to be hung up on. They wanted to charge me £400 just to investigate further after already paying for a check. They had the car all day and suggested to keep it for another day, they should have been able to carry out the diagnostics in one day. For less spend, I was able to take my car elsewhere where they investigated further and fixed the issue the same day!"

2023-03-27,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by the ease and reasonable cost of having a 2007 Toyota Estima (JDM) serviced by Inchcape Toyota Nottingham.
The dealership provided a video of the vehicle inspection/service which reassured me of the diligence of the service engineer and work needed.
The Estima requires 6 month servicing and I have already booked its next service (and MOT) with them."
2023-03-24,5,"Maria Atkinson is a credit to Inchcape Toyota Guildford.

I have been very well looked after by Maria over the past years. She makes me feel important and special. I have confidence Maria will do her utmost and often goes out of her way to ensure my interests are met.

Many car sales executives sweet talk and play psychology to make a sale. I appreciate Maria does not do such as I would feel rather insulted. She is always upfront and tells me what she could do within her remits to secure the best deal. I have never been pressured by her to buy a new car.

Maria took as much time as I wanted to hand over my new C-HR when I collected it five days ago. She did not rush when helping me to synchronise my mobile phone, set up the systems and ever so patient to explain the various functions of my C-HR. A couple of days later she phoned to ensure I am happy with the C-HR and all is well."

2023-04-17,1,My rav4 was bought from there in Aug 2022. I had the MOT done last week and was told to replace the brake disc.

2023-03-15,3,"This was the fourth time my car had gone to the dealer to fix the Infotainment Screen. It's early days since the screen has been changed; but it now appears to be working properly (fingers crossed).

It does appear it has been a trial & error process spread over 6 months or more.

The staff at the dealership are courteous & helpful; but the last 2 visits have been bookings for a week (to fix this problem) and both times the work has overrun. This last time it left me without access to a car (My wife needed hers) and caused a lot of disruption.

The routines at the dealership seem relatively inflexible and the dealership seems to have limited capacity to respond in a way that is helpful to the customer when things don't go to plan.

A larger fleet of courtesy cars might help!!

Each time I have had to push hard to persuade the dealership to provide a collect & deliver service. Given my location and the dealership's location, this should be a standard offer to someone in my situation. (As I believe it is with some other Land Rover dealerships)."
2023-03-27,5,I had a very positive experience. Joseph Vaughan was helpful and considerate throughout. He kept me informed at every stage and made the whole process easy. Thank you
2023-05-23,1,"Disgusting service from a luxury brand selling illegal vehicles, purchased a car from landrover Preston to find out at the beginning of the year that the vehicle has a mileage discrepancy from before we purchased from themselves, the car has done 34,000 more miles than originally advertised based on the mot certificate, the dealership found an internal invoice from another dealership and have corrected the mileage with dvsa without our permission, and after many months of them not co-operating enough is enough and it’s about time they are named and shamed, Inchcape prides themselves on selling used vehicles that go through checks to ensure there are no mileage discrepancy’s so how the hell did we end up purchasing one from yourselves, the checks were never done, you are now trying to cover yourselves, you sold a car illegally, you sold something that’s not as advertised under the consumer rights act 2015, Inchcape said I would not be able to hand the car back at the end of the contract due to the fact it has a discrepancy, yet you sold it with the discrepancy.

The maths adds up the recordings on the nmr prove the mileage on the car has been tampered with and the most hillarious thing they told me was that I was stupid to believe the car had done that amount of high mileage even thought the car is an OY number plate which Is a jaguar landrover fleet vehicle and we all know that fleet vehicles have high mileage

Avoid this dealership at all costs you will never be able to trust that the used car they are selling you is advertised if they aren’t even capable of doing a simple HPI check when they take vehicles as part exchanges

I wonder how many other people have been sold cars with discrepancy’s from the dealership"

2023-03-23,1,"My second brand new Toyota RAV4 where the cargo space floor has collapsed because of poor build quality of the plastic panels that support it.

The first time it was a fault with the model and covered by the warranty. The second time, similar issue but this time apparently there is no model fault so its not covered apparently. This makes no logical sense. What compounds my misery is the appalling customer service at Inchcape Guildford. Not replying to phone calls or emails. Not bothering to offer help or alternatives when there are issues. I can not use the boot of my car, and they don't seem to give a care about the amount of inconvenience that causes. Just a 'no sorry' and a door in the face (not literally but that's how it feels). I've been forced to go directly to Toyota as Inchcape Guildford only seem to care when they think they can make some money out of you.
This is my 4th or 5th car from them (yes I must be a mug) as I like Toyota cars (aside from the boot issue). I will be looking for another dealership in the near future, I am sick of chasing them."

From start to finish the whole sales process at Mercedes Stratford, was a very pleasurable process. All aspects handled efficiently and professionally. A huge thank you to John who could not have done more to help us and ensure we left extremely happy with our purchase.

My partner and I were looking to replace my car, having been to other dealerships (Audi and VW in Shirley where both the customer service and availability of vehicles was very disappointing) We decided to call in to Mercedes Stratford, we didn’t have an appointment but the receptionist made us feel very welcome, taking the time to understand exactly what we were looking for and booking us an appointment with the correct member of staff who could help us. We returned for our appointment and met John, who was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. There was no hard sell and we did not at all feel pressured. He arranged a test drive for us, then worked with our requirements to find us our perfect car.

John kept us informed throughout the whole process and went over and above to ensure we were completely satisfied not only during the sales process, but also with the after sales care. I can not recommend this dealership enough, we will most certainly be visiting again when we are ready to upgrade our car! Thank you!"

2023-03-23,3,"Very long-winded process in terms of collecting my Mercedes on Thursday 23rd March I took along my elder brother to collect the vehicle. The sales representative advised me before collection that free 7 days insurance would be included. However, on the day of collection Mercedes could not insure me. I then to my annoyance had to ring my existing insurance company (The AA) to ensure I had fully comprehensive insurance and also road tax in place. I spent an hour on the phone. In addition, the car had no fuel (Reserve light was on) in it at all so the sales representative had to waste more time to go out and put fuel in the car. In total I spent more than 3 hours at the dealer both I and my elder brother were both very frustrated. After now driving the car for under two weeks, I also have noticed that there is a tear on the passenger side door and the battery for the car is also partially charged (As per the Mercedes Me App). Both issues now need fixing which means further re-visits to the dealer. I note battery replacements are NOT covered by the 4-year warranty in place for the car. Should I find that the battery needs replacing a full formal complaint will be submitted to Mercedes and Leicester Inchcape Mercedes. Overall, a customer should not be spending 3 hours plus collecting their new car preparations should already be in place, via a collection checklist e.g., 7 days insurance cover in place, car has adequate level of fuel, and the car properly prepared with no signs of damage. Happy to have a conversation with Mercedes directly to also share my customer experience and issues with my Mercedes Vehicle."

However when I arrived at 10.25 took my Disability Scooter by Hoist from out of the Mercedes E-class Estate 220d W213 2017 Reg: GU17UNE, then went inside to give them the Key Fob.
Having taken the company car from them and went home just as I arrived home Mecedes of Cheshire Oaks phoned me to say that they could not start the MOT as therer is a seat belt light is on, which is a fault so could i come and pick my car up which I did then opened the tail gate and found that my hoist was not working, two people saw me trying to lift the scooter into the back of my car and gladly assisted to lift the scooter in. The point being that when I came to Mercedes Cheshire Oaks it was working but not now. I did phone them to report this problem, they said it was no where near the job that they did so it was nothing to do with them?.
I find this quite upsetting because I need this Hoist to use my Mobility Scooter out of the car to get around. They did say it could be the Motor thats failed a next door neighbour got his elec tool out to check the power to it and its dead so Mercedes cheshire Oaks have done something to cut the power and they should fix the problem.

2023-04-15,1,"I would have given zero stars.

Having found at Inchcape Ipswich, what we thought was a used BMW which met our criteria of low mileage and at the budget we set ourselves, we paid our deposit to have the vehicle brought from Chelmsford to Ipswich for us to test drive.

The day before the test drive we were then contacted by James at Inchcape, to be told the car had developed problems and the sale could not proceed.
We were informed that another option had just arrived and we could view that vehicle instead. Upon arriving to view the ""alternative vehicle"" we were informed it was diesel - we had specifically requested petrol!
However, the salesman (James), then amazed us with the story that our original choice had not in fact developed problems after all, and there had been a ""mix-up"" and it was another vehicle that had the problems - our original choice was still in Chelmsford - we again requested for the vehicle to be transferred from Chelmsford to Ipswich so we could test drive.

Unbelievably, the day before the test drive, James AGAIN contacted us to say the car was found to have problems, and was not in a good enough condition to meet Inchcapes high standards and was being withdrawn.
The salesman (James) went on to say how he had yet another option, just arrived, which was perfect for us. We went to see this ""perfect vehicle"". We had requested low mileage, this vehicle had, we eventually managed to prise out of James, over 70,000 recorded miles!
By now we had had enough, requested our £250 deposit be refunded and we walked away.

Amazingly, this car that we walked away from, which was "" not of a good enough standard and was being withdrawn because the salesman (James) could not allow such a vehicle to be sold to us"" is BACK for sale on Inchcapes website. Words fail me!

As a result of the continuous changing stories, we visited another well known local dealer - what a difference and how refreshing! Helpful staff made us feel welcome and valued They have found us a vehicle which exceeds our hopes, a newer vehicle, lower mileage, same price.

Very sadly this experience has tainted my views on my local BMW dealer, after previous positive purchases from the same dealer."

2023-04-03,1,"So disappointed as I’ve always had good service from Guilford ! First of all I was told I had to pay £20 for a hire car which Neil In The sales team had waivered for me , however not communicated with service team ! Then I was looking at the new Rav 4 GR on display took pictures to send my husband and he sent back are the steps on both sides of rav included in the price so the service gentleman said he would ask on the way to my hire car he asked a sales man I think Australian he looked at me and said he didn’t know and anyway couldn’t order them anyway was not interested at all I asked again and he said he would have to check however there was interest and just walked away , maybe I wasn’t dressed up enough or look like I could afford it that is how it made me feel !
The service gentleman asked coukd we wash my car and I said of course thankyou .
I then got a phone call at 2.15 to say my car was ready and been washed all ready to pick up .
When I got there I walked by my car and clearly hadn’t been washed I touched the door and the alloys and they were filthy , I went in and apparently was approached by the sales team and I explained I was here to collect my car and it seems it wasn’t washed he said he would go and get someone 15 minutes later I then asked the lady at the desk she came back and said the sales man didn’t tell anyone ! The same gentleman I saw in the morning came out I showed him my dirty fingers and he said it has been washed and then proceeded to look at my car and was shocked that it hadn’t been cleaned he said they wouldn’t touch alloys as they could ruin them with acids , I only thought they were gonna wash them !!!! He insisted on having it washed so another 15 mins later and well let’s say I think water had been put on it , it was awful , I said don’t they chamois it anymore and he sort of laughed it was awful he had put complimentary pack of mints in my service book I said was that before or after I said about the car and he said after , oh my goodness I am so angry I then said I didn’t like the way the sales man spoke to me this morning and that he wasn’t interested and was it the way I looked maybe and the service gentleman said I know it wasn’t very good ! I could not wait to get in my car my daughter was with me and could not believe it either and I kept my cool ! So my car looked dirty and was dripping wet when pulling away from the garage and to top it all when I looked at the invoice it says my car has been washed and hoovered inside which it was not touched inside ! We are thinking of exchanging our Rav for another Toyota however not at Guilford branch so disappointed and I am still quite angry look forward to your response !"

I am shocked about their Service last year they pass with 4 advisory and nothing repaired after whole year driving this time they passed my car MOT without any advisory ? how all 4 problems shorted ? shocked ? they ignored me very badly didn't repair, didn't bother about my or my car safety ? I need help to complain appropriate department, thinking to go Citizen Advice B to seek advice because I paid whole year hard working money for warranty and they ignored my safety."
2023-03-22,5,Made my visit so easy they were all so friendly and helpful even helped me park my car when I arrived as I'm not the best driver!
2023-03-27,5,I have been delighted by the service I have received from Mercedes Coventry. The replacement of the rear sub frame under a goodwill warranty was impressive as was the subsequent diagnosis of the sinking rear air suspension which occurred after the sub frame replacement. To have this repaired without charge was deeply impressive. I am grateful to Rebecca and then Stuart and Sophie for the way this has all been handled by the team. This the fourth E class estate I have owned in the past 25 years and it won’t be the last.
2023-03-22,5,Rodwin is a star. I’ve meet many car sales persons over the years but he’s way above the rest. Very knowledgeable of the product and professional at all times. More than happy to deal with him again in the future.

2023-03-15,1,Charged £150 for a diagnostic with no diagnosis provided despite keeping my car for a week. Returned car covered in bird faeces. Never provided updates meaning I had to call and wait on hold. Never returned calls as promised. Not the first time I have had these problems with Inchcape. I have previously taken car im with an engine warning light and had the car handed back still with an engine warning light. The worst customer service on top of the worst vehicle service.
2023-03-23,5,"Very accommodating
Fast and great service
Lovely staff"
2023-02-14,1,"Our sons car was returned to Toyota Guildford 2 weeks after buying as the gearstick/clutch were terrible. Had to force it into 3/4th gears.
Got refund eventually for it.
Car returned on 14 Feb 2023 car is still showing as taxed. Been chasing them to cancel my sons from the V5 but they said it's gone to auction now and will change ownership once sold?
I said no you should have cancelled him as owner as soon as it was received back at the dealership.
I cannot cancel it with DVLA as do not have the 12 digit no from V5.
Still showing as taxed today 25/3/23.
How do I take my son off of the V5?
We will end up getting fined?
I think they wanted to auction it to look like a private seller? And one less owner as well?
UPDATE: Just had a reply form Inchcape to my complaint. Took long enough. Had to get a new V5 to then send off to remove my son's name from the paperwork as they had lost the original V5."
2023-03-21,5,"I recently made a purchase with the help of Alex who was amazing. Everything from start to finish was really easy and the whole process was completed in under less than 14 days. Alex kept me updated daily and I can’t thank her enough.

2023-03-23,5,First time using this Inchcape service and I’m really happy with the support and service I got selling my car. I not only got a much more competitive price than the other quick car sale companies but also had excellent communication with Joseph Vaughan my buyer at Inchcape.

2023-03-20,5,"I have been a regular visitor of Audi Stockport since 2019, each time I was treated as a valuable customer and my cars were serviced with no issues. On my last visit the Manager himself was very helpful in promptly resolving an issue with a head on display on my Q7."

2023-03-09,5,"A truly exceptional service from start to finish for me.

Well looked after for my entire visit when collecting my car. A clean and tidy place with friendly people willing to help in anyway they can to make your time there as smooth as possible.

As for my sales executive Jack Birch I have to take the time out to mention him personally as I do feel he is a complete credit to Inchcape Jaguar Derby just based on the service he provided me.

Happy to help with any queries I had throughout, handled my first experience at Jaguar with an impeccable service from the first second we made contact and defined what I believe is going above and beyond.

Jack Birch is great asset to his team as is Clive Walshaw, if you are lucky enough to have met, or ever get the pleasure of meeting either you certainly won’t be disappointed."
2023-03-17,5,I attended Inchcape Toyota Derby last week to have a dash cam fitted - I didn't need my car and I was given a lift to pop into Derby by William and I walked back - when I got back William showed me how the dash cam works and a few other points I had forgotten - he was brilliant and so patient - definitely a very good ambassador for both Toyota and Inchcape - Thanks William
2023-03-21,5,"Really easy from start to finish, good communications. Thanks"
2023-02-25,1,"I took my car to Mercedes Liverpool for a recall which was to take no more than a few hours it was kept for two days, after circa 14 calls to try and find out what was happening and having to miss appointments the following day. When I drove my car home, we realised there was a strange dent in the car.

After calling immediately to make the team aware, they said I would need to wait for a colleague to come back from holiday to gain access to the CCTV. I waited two weeks and made another call, and your manager said I was not permitted to footage due to GDPR, then, after a 30-minutes he called back and said I could have the footage? This was sent but with no date and no image of who was driving.

This was flagged to the main customer care team see below, and they provided incorrect facts saying my car was in for one day when it was with them for two. Stating the dent had been listed and costs noted, which it hadn't. When collecting the car, the chap mentioned the basics on the report nothing was mentioned about bodywork damage.

I still wait for a reply to the email below sent on 25/02.

From start to finish the stress associated with the guy in customer care said the reason he didn't call me back was that he was under intense pressure from the whole chain of communication being so disappointing and not factual.

I am left with a car with a bump which wasn't there when I took my car and with no image of me driving the car in with it and not costs listed for bodywork damage when leaving.

All very odd, wouldn't you say!

I have screenshots of the number of calls made to show the appalling customer service.

Hi Emma,

The car was with you for two days, so this isn't factual - it could be someone driving back in from your team the following day.

Unfortunately, the system now cannot go back that far, but the date of arrival is irrelevant, given the car has only ever been with the retailer for that one day. You can see the month and the arrival time, and this is the only time the vehicle has been to our centre.

The costs - I have the visual inspection sheet - the costs of £726.00 are made up of External £139.20 + £139.20 and Brakes / Hub £447.60 a total of £726.00

No' Dents' are listed, just scratches and no costs attributed.

With reference to the information recorded on the Mercedes Visual Inspection sheet (attached), the technician has recorded the damage as best as the system allows and quoted an estimated cost to repair.

I would like confirmation if any of your team used my car that evening and drove the car back into the garage the following day.

To confirm the car was dropped off on 20/10/2022 earlier.

I require an answer within the week as this has been resent to you again after no reply.

Regards,

Kathryn Orr"
2023-03-17,5,good service and relax environment
2023-03-17,5,"The experience of dealing with your team has been fantastic. From my first call with Helen, who was amazing and stepped me through the process, she was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions. The new check-in process was fantastic and saved me time with the secure drop-off of my keys. The videos put me at ease that the work was carried out and my vehicle was inspected thoroughly. The pick-up was a breeze as well. Overall, I am thrilled with the experience and will not hesitate to use you again for my next service or buy my next VW from you."

2023-03-16,5,"We came to purchase a used approved Mercedes Benz. We had the finances in place and no part ex. We arrived without making an appointment but all the staff did their upmost to make us feel welcome (with refreshments) and updated as to when someone could see us.
Hassan was extremely attentive to what we were interested in and ensured we could view the vehicles and test drive whilst he was seeing to other customers- really managing time and expectations well.
Once we decided on a vehicle, we were given complete piece of mind that the car has a complete check over and is fully warranted. On collection, the car was presented to us and handed over in such a way that it made us feel special and valued. The sales manager also took the time to say thank you for our custom and assured us that we could contact them at any time. Overall, the experience was brilliant and we will continue to go to this dealership."
2023-03-14,3,"I am on a Lexus Svce plan.
Had my NX350h for service and mot. Also fault diagnostic test was to be carried out due to esp warning light(yellow steering wheel ) occasionally appeared on dashboard.

Also no call to say car ready for collection"

2023-03-17,1,"Poor experience on my last purchase from Macclesfield Audi. Upon collection of the car it wasn’t the showroom finish I was expecting, it also took some back and forth to get things sorted. In December 2022 an issue was reported which the Service Department never fully resolved and the lack of contact and customer experience was extremely poor. Additionally, a service plan agreed at the point of sale was never set up and received no response from Macclesfield Audi and very little help or support from Inchcape Customer Service Team when trying to resolve the matters. Extremely disappointing."
2023-03-17,4,"Brilliant service, both people and delivery.

Sales people provided a good commercial experience but let themselves down by failing to properly communicate terms agreed with respect to the installation of extras purchased on the finance agreement and some remedial work.

Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to use Inchcape Sandhurst again and would happily recommend the branch"
2023-03-16,1,"Inchcape BMW Chelmsford
Appalling. I bought a 75k car in November 2022. Arrived filthy, undriveable with a nail though the tyre. The delivery guy was in such a rush he left without giving me any keys, all windows down in the rain the interior got soaked. On inspection of the car there ws damage to the front paintwork. They did mention this prior to sale but said it would be put right, it was not. It is now march 2023, Ive been back and forth with multiple people at the garage, promised the world yet nothing happens. Handed from one person to the next. I even had a local BMW garage photo the paint damage and offer to repair but Chelmsford Bmw simply needed to phone them but after repeated requests still nothing. Car had chips to bonnet, dent in passenger door sill and an inch long deep scratch on front spoiler. The first 3 weeks it was entirely off the road, unsafe and undriveable. It was delivered with nail through the tyre. BMW did not show up when they were meant to come to repair, it was delayed and delayed. I waited until 12.30am then was told no one could get to me until 5am. I couldn't stay awake over night. I phoned BMW Chelmsford who authorised me to get it repaired on my drive, send them the receipt and it would be refunded. Ive been chasing this refund for 4 months. Car warning lights also on showing no adblue and low coolant within days of delivery, despite the website stating is has detailed eoinspection none of these were noticed. I called RAC out and they said the radiator should be drained in full which I could not do. BMW chelsford just continued to ignore repeat calls and emails. Out of office messages, promises they would sort but nothing. Also didn't receive log book for 4 months. They did not change over my private plate from my trade in as promised. Instead just posted the V5 from my trade in back to me to sort out myself. Ive had nothing but trouble, off the road 3 weeks and having to watch a near new 75k BMW be picked up by a tow truck in the street isnt good news. This garage is to be avoided at all costs. There is zero follow up, no customer service (if you can get though to anyone), the car was not even slightly as described, no checks had been done and delivered in an appalling state. AVOID AVOID AVOID"
2023-03-15,5,Reception and Service staff were lovely!
2023-03-11,1,"Worst,extremely poor Customer Service at Inchcape Mercedes Benz Loughborough. Dropping car for a service,the female receptionist facial expression was unfriendly not fit for front house,selective interaction with customers. Enquired about the GLC 2023 salesman's response was it's too expensive 🙆🏼‍♀️ asked how expensive is it and he decided to say the wrong higher expensive price. Obviously they didn't want to sell cars that minute I enquired, so why open the showroom. How do Mercedes Benz staff at Loughborough judge customers affordability? I was disgusted with the awful, extremely poor customer service. I received an email from the Manager saying sales man did not mean that way 😵😵. I would never ever recommend Inchcape Mercedes Benz Loughborough they won 🏆 the worst customer service in my 2023 March diary. Will not recommend Loughborough Inchcape branch, stay away. Deserves zero star in my opinion."
2023-03-12,1,"Sending a vehicle out as an approved used car should guarantee that the buyer won't have 1 failure let alone 2 in the first 24 hours
(150 miles). Perhaps the ABS sensor failure could be argued as bad luck but a badly fitted drain plug and gasket, fitted by yourselves in Feb, is inexcusable.
I'm still waiting for a copy of the service record for February 2023 and the paper copy of the MOT. If asked I'd have asked for a printed detail of the MB12 month Breakdown service and the 12month MB Warranty to keep in the car. Perhaps that could be rectified as well. I've had no apology from you either. In contrast MB Teeside (Sytner) have been exemplary in their customer service and communication. If there was an option to give you no stars I would probably opted for that."
2023-01-09,5,Our first time using Inchcape Toyota Warrington & very satisfied with friendly very informed sales team I particularly Charles Jordan who dealt with our recent purchase so helpful not at all pushy in a very relaxed well organised showroom couldn’t fault our service there !!
2023-03-11,5,I was served by Simon who did an amazing job in looking after me and my car which was booked in as a WAITING appointment. He kept me updated on every step of progress and fully explained the Vehicle Health check at the end and booked me in to have the work highlighted in the report carried out. Absolute excellent service
2023-03-13,2,"I had one operating problem with the car and I was told they had not had time to investigate and I would have to book it in to be looked at. It was there for 6 hours.
It had a new battery last year (under Mercedes warranty) as the eco stop/start system didn't work. Doesn't work again now."
2022-03-15,1,"ZERO STARS for Inchcape & Jaguar vehicles

Bought a 17 plate XE from a private dealer with 30K mileage. Nothing but problems from the word go. I can't fault the prestige look of these cars but thats where the quality ends for me. Very poor build quality - mechanically, electronically and body - constant niggles which cost heaven and earth with Inchcape. Servicing and parts department came across as very unorganised, arrogant and rude. 13 months into ownership and 40K miles - catalyst convertor went and a £3k bill. Took over a week and multiple to and fro phone calls to be resolved. Even sorting the invoice for my 3rd party warranty company was a nightmare - was told that they wouldn't be dictated to and our invoicing is done on our terms. Suffice to say the Jag got sold and i've gone back to leasing with another manufacturer. HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE!!!!"

If they wash coated vehicles, they should use negative Ph Shampoo and their staff should know this.
The heated seat panel had clipped out of the surround and I asked that it be put back in place. I was quoted £78 to do this. I refused. It took me less than 5 minutes to prize out the blank switch adjoining this panel, push a screwdriver in and lever the panel back into position."

I have an RAC warranty which suggested a local garage but I wanted the very best workmanship so agreed to pay double the hourly rate to have my car worked on at Inchcape Jaguar in Chester. The service I received was terrible, I lost count at how many times I had to ring for a Progress Report and NO ONE got back to me. They needed to order tool to carry out the work and just kept saying they had no date when this tool would arrive. My car was eventually ready to be picked up on Thursday 9th March !!!! it was there for 7 weeks. If you have an F-Type and the injectors fail I would NOT recommend paying the excessive labour charge to get the job done here."

I rang up Mercedes, spoke to reception and mechanics been cut of few times, kept ringing.
Mechanic told me they only done airbag and its nothing they have done will cause the car to stop. They are not willing to take the car in or check. Poor customer service, with name Benz you except at least minimum level of customer service, but not here in Liverpool."
2023-03-03,5,"I recently sold an Audi A3 to Inchcape using the online service.
The price was good and much better than offered by WeBuyAnyCar.
Joseph Vaughan from Inchcape handled the sale and was very helpful, responding rapidly to all queries and issues."
2023-02-23,5,Very easy process and great communication
2023-02-28,5,"I have been buying VW's from Inchcape for 20 years, and the service keeps improving, and my time there filling out paperwork has decreased, very accommodating and helpful, 10/10 thank you"
2023-03-02,5,Friendly and helpful staff. Very efficient
2023-03-03,5,"Lee and the team at Mercedes Benz of Southport service and maintain both of my vehicles, and provide a stress free faultless service.
Lee is extremely knowledgable and thorough, and having the vehicles assigned to a specific colleague means that you are kept well-informed as to where the team are up to with the service and maintenance of your vehicle. Although only a small dealership, the service is professional and friendly; I would recommend Mercedes Benz of Southport."
2023-02-28,1,Very disappointed to find I lost half a tank of petrol when responding to this recall.
2023-02-28,5,Nice atmosphere
2023-02-21,5,"Booked in for major service (112k) and MOT.
The personal friendly and efficient service from Lisa in the Service department.
Made a chore a pleasant experience.
Well done Lisa. Excellent."
2023-03-01,5,"Nothing was too much trouble for Lisa Brabin in order to make our visit fantastic, many thanks.."
2023-02-23,5,"Routine oil service. Well organised, minor replacement agreed and completed in 1 hour. Friendly service."
2023-03-02,5,Fantastic service. Both Holly and Joseph very helpful with answering all my questions. Will definately use again

2023-02-23,5,"Great service at Audi Hyde.
Car went in for a health check and I was really impressed how helpful the staff were. The Technician also came out to talk me through the car & what was found.
I will definitely use again."
2023-02-24,1,"I was particularly disappointed in the sales team and their responses for the following reasons:-
1. There was a delay in the car being available and despite this the car had a number of unresolved issues when it was handed over to me for example there was no service book available, no handbook, no shelf rack on the boot, no spare key; in addition I had been promised that two wheel trims would be replaced and that had not been completed
2. When I ordered the car I asked for a service plan I had to ask for this to be progressed on a number of occasions
3. The most disappointing aspect of my experience was the numerous calls I had to make to the sales team querying the status of my purchase and availability of the car. On a number of occasions I was promised a call back but this was not actioned which resulted in me having to make further calls.
In all honesty I could not recommend the Toyota sales team at the Derby branch because of the lack of customer care."
2023-02-28,1,Disgraceful! will never buy a car off these cowboys. Trying to buy a car and the next day they put the price up and refused to honour the price we had been discussing.
2023-02-23,5,Great service as always
2023-02-22,4,"Despite a problem with a new system which allows the customer to authorise and pay for additional work found during a service, they did everything they could to solve the issue and ensure the impact on me as the customer was minimal."
2023-02-27,5,"Great customer service
Very friendly & helpful team"
2023-02-21,5,They kept me up to date with everything via text messages emails and personal video messages which were a surprisingly nice touch. Everything was easy. No hick ups or problems. Excellent service.
2023-02-23,5,"It was a great experience from start to finish. Staff and shark thought I was happy with what our vehicle I selected.
All questions asked was answered. I was also give him the OK to phone if I have any further questions."
2023-02-24,5,Excellent people to get my car serviced through. Very knowledgeable and very professional nothing was too much trouble made you feel very important and even washed and hovered my car for me afterwards. Great place to go ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2023-02-21,5,Great service & hassle free for MOT & clean up

2023-02-25,5,Very professional attitude and a quick service.
2023-02-25,1,"Inchcape Nottingham Mercedes. WOW, awful sales customer service. Went to discuss buying new Mercedes e vehicle, but salesperson was as unhelpful and rather rude as you can get, could not be more ""not bothered"" or disinterested. Classic ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" I might not dress like I've got £150k but that doesn't mean to say I don't. Lost a huge sale there Inchcape!! Won't be visiting again."
2023-02-13,3,Remote booking is not very good. Service in dealership poor. Would not choose a VW again. 2 x poor experiences 10 years apart
2023-02-20,5,Great customer service friendly staff and willingness to make things as easy and fuss free as possible.
2023-02-20,5,Excellent service guys. Thank you
2023-02-18,5,"Team were easy going and professional. Followed up on queries that they couldn't respond to straight away and showed effort above and beyond to get a vehicle ready in a very short period of time, without compromising the experience or the quality of the vehicle handed over."
2023-02-18,3,"The visit to the dealership was excellent. Friendly, knowledgeable staff who gave me a high quality experience as has always been the case.
However, the booking-in process by telephone was poor. The phone handler had a poor phone line and her approach was rushed. The staff member bombarded me with questions and proceeded to offer me one costed extra after another, which would have increased the price and were not necessary. She quoted me £20 for a loan car, which on arriving at the dealership was not applicable. I did not have such a poor customer experience with Bentleys and it has left me with a very poor opinion of Inchcape!"
2023-02-13,5,Sean was really helpful and was able to organise a test drive last minute which I really appreciated. As Mercedes have just launched a new system to buy a car this was a new experience for myself however Sean explained everything thoroughly and kept me up to date with the whole process. I am really enjoying my new car and I am glad I chose the Leicester branch as my dealership.
2023-02-20,1,"I was told the wait for changing discs & brake pads at the rear would be 1 hour, I was still there 3.5 hours later, not pleased 🤨"
2023-02-14,4,"My Audi A3 was booked in initially on 3rd Jan. Detailed itinerary stated the car would be returned on the day and this was confirmed on the phone when booking. However on the day I was told the recall (software update) would take up to 3 days and with no loan car available. Of course I rearranged the booking which went well. Loan car was a manual even though I drive an automatic, and as impossible as it sounds it led to me stalling on a motorway, in slow traffic thankfully. But everything was fine after that. Car was ready to pick up within 2 days, however the car wasn’t given the complimentary clean that we agreed upon. This would have been completely fine if there wasn’t black grease prints dotted around the whole car. There was a scrape also on the front passenger side alloy wheel, but I can’t be certain if that was done in the care of Audi or myself but was a surprise to see nonetheless."
2023-02-21,1,"The 3 faults on the car were not fixed, 2 of them being found by a roadside vehicle that came out to the car and sent a report through to Mercedes. All they did was a health and safety check, I now have a car with 3 faults on one being £1000.00 to fix and car still under warranty"
2022-12-23,5,Bought a second hand vw polo from Inchcape Stockport in December and the experience was easy and very pleasant. Chris Martin was very helpful and I had the car very quickly and I absolutely love it!
2023-02-22,1,"Called Inchape Chester service to book enquire about cost of service and was quoted £538, informed them I’ll just need to check dates with my wife. Called back 4 days later to book only to be told by Inchape the price had gone up to £585 and they cannot do anything even though I was quoted less a few days earlier, I was told I should have booked it in then… As luck would have it found a local authorised service centre who are doing it for half the price so they’ve saved me a few hundred quid …. But still poor service from a so called luxury brand. Has made me think twice about about my next car purchase but it will not be from Inchape that’s for sure"
2023-02-18,5,"Excellent customer service from Jason Coates at Lexus Inchcape Derby, making purchasing the car an easy and pleasant experience."
2023-02-10,5,"Inchcape Guildford - Staff are aware when you drive up and park whether your car is due for service or MOT by your vehicle registration number. They come out and request your key. Although it would be good to introduce themselves or have a name tag, so that you know you're not handing your keys to someone other than an employee from Inchcape.
It was very cold in the showroom because the heating had broken down but staff did their best by providing fan heaters.
Zara, who looked after me left me with a positive outlook on the company. She was very friendly, cheerful and positive, even though at the time she had badly hurt her hip. She listened to my requirements and made sure they were enacted. During my MOT, she kept me informed of the time scale and asked if I wanted a courtesy car wash and provided the extra time this would take. At the end she went through things that needed to be attended before the next MOT.
A good overall experience.
A Wright"
2023-02-21,5,"Communication superb, knew what was happening every step of the process, very efficient and smooth transaction, would definitely recommend to others."
2022-11-30,5,"Chelmsford Mini

Tom Smith at Inchcape Chelmsford Mini was a joy to deal with. Picked up the brand new 5-dr mini late last year after ordering it earlier that month during the winter sale. It was clear they were having a hectic time but Tom was still very attentive to our selections, questions etc... What I thought was especially nice was a recent phone call checking if everything was good and if we had issues with the car or generally have questions for him.

Top-notch customer service from Tom. If Mini is reading this, I asked Tom if the diecast model car of the F55 (5-dr) is available anywhere, I believe he was going to check. It seemed only the F56 model is available."
2023-02-17,5,Sold my car on Motorway and Inchcape won the Bid. Dealt with them after that Joseph and his team made sure everything went through smoothly.

2023-02-15,5,All the staff had time for you. Everything was explained in detail. Just a good experience all round. Never been looked after so well in any other dealership. Would recommend 1000%

Since I have order a new car by the day of collection I feel like a V.I.P. they been looking after me very well. I would like recommend strongly If you thinking about new car, please visit them"
2023-02-17,1,"Waited that long for a part (5
weeks off the road) the MOT expired and they charged me for it, also had to hire a car during this time and claim the money back, 6 weeks later the money arrived with
no apology. Senior managers failed to respond and treat customers with contempt. Inchcape also unwilling to lookfor the part outside of their usual supply chain despite it being availbe elsewhere, you pay extra at a main dealer for a jaguar approved vehicle and the extra customer support but will using an independent dealer for next purchase I am affraid. AVOID using these for your car purchase."
2023-02-17,5,Excellent service. Within an hour of reporting a fault Roadside assist came and inspected my car. I rang the service manager Josh who was extremely helpful and booked my car in to be repaired. I was given a fantastic courtesy car while my car was in the garage.The Vehicle Health Check video is brilliant and clearly identifies any problems with the car .The work was completed the same day and I was back on the road that evening . Absolutely Brilliant Thank you to Josh and all the team at Mercedes Benz Warrington

2023-02-14,1,"I recently bought a pre-owned car from Inchcape, Stockport and drove it home. Up to this point the sales experience had been very good and I was pleased with the purchase. However, when I went to start it later that day it was completely dead. The AA arrived and got it going, but said the battery had gone and I needed to take it back to the garage immediately. I did so and they gave me a coutesy car while they took a full week to put in a new battery. I picked it up again, drove it home again and again parked it. Two days later when I went to drive in it again, I noticed it had acquired a dent. Inchcape are refusing to deal with this because I hadn't noted it when I picked the car up, so clearly checking a car for dents is something you must do when Inchcape has your car. Actually, I had had a similar experience with Inchcape in Macclesfield, so this just goes to confirm that they are not to be recommended."
2023-02-14,5,Everyone at Mercedes Leicester are friendly approachable and supportive. They have gone above and beyond to support me with all the cars that I’ve had from them over the years.
2023-02-08,5,Excellent service as per usual.

Daniel came and took mi to his desk. Sort everything within 2 min and I was done. The gentleman on the from of me was still on that self service stand while I was done in less then 2 min.
Staff are very friendly helpful and welcome.
They are remember me every time I’m there !"
2023-02-09,1,"Told when booking service would take 2.5 hour's, service took 7 hour's with no communication. Dash cam had been disconnected and setting on dashboard not as left. Also, automatic stop / start system not working as previous new car, it would appear that Volkswagen system is not fit for purpose, as its still not working and reasons given was in my opinion a cock and bull story."
2023-01-31,1,"Very poor experience, bought a car there are couple of faults with it, which should have been picked up during prep and it wasn’t.

Second key doesn’t flip out and instead of repairing the fob it was left in the gift box hoping we wouldn’t notice.

Infotainment full of dead pixels was not informed and only noticed when I went to pick it up. Promised they will check with vw and get back and they didn’t, luckily warranty will cover this but more hassle booking it in for repairs.

There is a problem with the hvac where it’s constantly blowing cold and warranty will not cover as local dealer main vw dealer says it was damaged by someone not a manufacturing fault.

I can’t get hold of sales man to resolve this. Part of the deal was car comes with a free service for next one and it was supposedly on the system but my local dealer can’t locate that either.

I don’t understand why no one getting hold of this issue at Stockport to resolve it. I spoke to another sales person and I am being told to speak to the guy who sold it, that’s easy if you can speak to him or his boss!"

The man who I dealt with (Dominic I think) was really helpful in setting up my new service plan saving me money which is unusual for car dealerships nowadays. I’ve always taken my car to VW in Bolton and have never been disappointed. They even washed and hoovered my car for free. Great service, thank you"
2023-02-01,1,"Sales is very good but followed up terrible! I have had my new tricks back 3 times for the dane problem, at first the man in the aftercare department was rude and dismissed my concerns. I did ask him to repeat what he had said to me in front of my husband. Now after another visit with the same problem I am waiting for a part to prove it’s a problem with the car!! Very disappointed by the senior male receptionist in the after care department and by their inability to resolve my issues . This car cost 34k and should be prefect !"

She then videoed me unveiling my new Yaris, and guided me through the features, connected my mobile and reminded me to wipe my details from my old Toyota. Would recommend Maria and Inchcape Toyota to everyone, for their friendly efficient service ."
2023-01-27,5,"No rush, no pressure, clear explanation of options. Ample one hour test drive time. Offer of additional assistance on any queries even how to get best of driving car. Really impressed and felt a valued customer"
2023-01-30,5,"I travelled a long way to buy the Toyota model that I've been searching, for over the last few months, and I wasn't disappointed when I arrived in Derby! The customer service was excellent - friendly and most efficient. The Corolla 2.0 Sport Hatchback that I purchased on the day has proved to be the best car I've ever owned (and I've been driving for over 50 years!). I will certainly be returning when I buy my next car in about three years time!"
2023-01-24,2,"This was the 3rd time I have been back with the same fault. The customer service is somewhat lacking. You check in online the day before, fine. But then when you get through the door receptionist are very polite and efficient (if they are there and there isnt a queue of 3 people waiting) but then you are shown to a seat where you can see the service team through a glass wall and door chatting (obviously context is unknown), and then you wait and wait and consider a second coffee before anyone comes out to you.
After my car had the fault repaired it was agreed that it would be kept overnight to test in the morning. The fault reoccurred in the morning so I was told someone would call me later. No call. I rang at 5 myself to find out what was going on. not the best customer service."

2023-01-31,1,"My experience with Inchcape Chester was a bad experience throughout. I tried to order a new Rangerover Vogue and had a most lacklustre performance from the sales person Craig Leatherbarrow. I had to chase over a period of 2 weeks and yes 2 weeks to get my order £116K plus finalised my emails were ignored my phone calls ignored and when I rang to complain to the Dealer Principal about the dreadful service I was rerouted straight back through to Greg Leatherbarrow who came up with a variety of excuses, I decided to let it go and give him another chance and guess what , again he did not contact me for a week and when I emailed him to say I wanted some final tweaks in my order he replied “ in appointment so fair enough I left it for most of the day and rang back in the afternoon , the receptionist said he was busy and would get him to ring back! unbelievably but by now not surprised I left it a week, yes a week and still nothing so therefore not allowed to speak directly to the Dealer Principle as I requested to the receptionist which means that if you wish to complain about something the staff cover up for each other and the man who should know never finds out what is going on in the organisation he or she is responsible for, very very bad for a high profile company like Inchcape in fact disgraceful.
Anyway I went personally to Inchcape and proceeded directly upstairs where I met with the business manager who I thought to be The Dealer Principal which he realised but chose not to inform me of that!
He listened to my complaints and issues plus my information that made it quite clear I thought I was dealing with The General Manager (DP)as I wanted to cancel my order and go elsewhere he then apologised for my problems and experience and offered to sort out the order personally which I went with.
Which he in fact did and then when he emailed me confirmation and a further apology I saw that I had in fact been dealing with The Business Manager and not the General Manager as I had requested??
I emailed Mr Rudi Boyd and thanked him for his email etc and also directly asked if he was The Dealer Principal then was on Friday 27/01/23 today is Tuesday 31/01/23 and no reply believe it or not.
I purchased my previous Vogue from Inchcape Chester and all ongoing servicing etc and always thought them to be most professional however my recent experience has been most timewasting and incredibly frustrating for me and certainly not anywhere near the the professional level expected from a national company like Inchcape, 2 weeks and more to spend this kind of money, not good at all!!?
I intend to write to the chairman and bring this to his attention.
I also look forward to seeing my honest complaint issues on Trustpilot

In January 2023 checked tyre pressures as tyres looking a bit flat. Discovered all tyre pressures set at 29 psi. Label on door pillar clearly states should be 36 psi! Phoned VW garage in Cheltenham but although I pressed buttons for Service department was put through to a call centre who obviously was not the service department. She refused to pass on the problem with the tyre pressure to the service manager in Cheltenham, said I could email, etc. Gave up after that. Hate call centres! After pressing numerous buttons on phone should be put through to the department you want, NOT a call centre."

2023-01-20,5,"The car was returned to me in immaculate condition. The feedback was thorough, easy for me to understand and follow and very helpful. The work done as far as I can assess was faultless. I have great confidence in the excellence of Inchcape workmanship over many years of their servicing my car."
2023-01-16,1,"Multiple issues with the vehicle that is less than 2 years old. It was a full time job chasing the dealership/garage to get the work done. Spoke with the GM (Craig), after explaining the full extent of our issues, I was promised an update phone call, it never materialised ( I even chased him and he failed to return my call) I had to proactively chase most days for an update and lost count the number of times that a promised call back didn’t materialise. Basic customer service is lacking and the whole customer experience is materially disjointed. This is our third car from this dealership and we are seriously considering where we purchase from next. A very frustrating, lacklustre and time consuming experience, that I wouldn’t want to repeat. Business seems to come to them too easily and the customer seems to be a nuisance rather than an asset."
2023-01-28,1,"I have honestly never received service like this. The website/autotrader advert states that ""This BMW 4 Series is fully prepared and ready for its next journey and can be delivered to your location or collected whenever suits you!"" (does not state within 50 miles) i informed them i am 200 miles away, this was never an issue, explained i had a part ex? (never an issue) asked about car tax (quoted the wrong prices) I then basically agreed to take the car full price and my finance application was submitted/in place. I then received an image of a scuffed wheel and damage to a door which needed respraying. Please note the advert for the car quotes - ""With just 1 owner, it has been meticulously looked after as shown and is ready for its new owner to enjoy"". I then got told they would need to see my part ex and i would need to travel down.. To then receive a call-back from a manager who started the phone call ""Hi, i believe your asking/expecting us to do something that we don't do?"" very patronising attitude throughout the call. Also you will see that the website states that cars can be reserved for £99 however this branch will ask you to leave £500. I was told previously £99 only secures it for 48 hours but £500 secures it for longer? Whilst on the website i noticed they also give a part ex valuations instantly which when i started to go through this, it was basically the exact same questions i was asked on my first phone call when i told them i had a part exchange so i am guessing they use the inchcape valuation tool? Either way if they don't, my valuation my end come back £400 more than what they offered me (same questions answered) very strange. If anyone is considering buying a car from this branch I hope this review of my experience gives a better insight of what type of branch you are dealing with."
2023-01-14,5,From the moment I made an enquiry to me collecting my vehicle the standard of customer service was faultless and so easy which made the whole experience 10/10. Megan was amazing and made looking for a new car a pleasure! Her knowledge and understanding of the vehicle and my requirements was brilliant! Highly recommended!
2023-01-26,5,"Very helpful, honest and straightforward. Excellent customer service from Sean and Simeon."
2023-01-24,5,Excellent service.
2023-01-22,5,"From when we found the car advertised on Autotrader, to make the initial telephone enquiry with Tyler Heath the communication was excellent. This was followed up by a visit to the showroom to view and test drive the car, again, Tyler looked after us very well, explaining everything clearly. We placed the order and on the collection day, the car was ready, Tyler ran through the controls at handover and completed the final paperwork and away we went!
Altogether, it was a good car buying experience, a positive one where Tyler looked after us from start to finish."
2023-01-27,5,Fantastic place to here any questions you have are answered and really do make you feel welcome whenever you talk to them
2023-01-23,5,"Great, friendly service, the full service and health check were shared easily over the phone."

2023-01-20,5,Natalia amazing service well done
2023-01-27,5,"Quick, simple and professional. Excellent service"
2023-01-03,1,"Received a really bad service from Lexus Nottingham. 3-week delay to upgrade the purchased car. Very poor communication and lack of responsiveness and compensation. The salesperson is Sascha and business manager is Zelda and the main manager is Martin. I totally recommend against this branch of Inchcape which also includes Toyota Nottingham. It was an absolute waste of time and loads of unnecessary stress. Obviously, they don't have enough staff and they are not good at their job."
2023-01-23,5,Brilliant service from beginning to end. Felt valued as a customer throughout
2023-01-27,5,"Great customer service , very helpful , respectful and kind. Shabs was great to deal with, and I couldn't recommend anyone better . Made the process easy , stress free and enjoyable experience"
2023-01-11,1,"My car Reg: NL20WWS. Car is still in warranty. came up with electrical system fault in red on the dashboard. Booked it with Audi Cheshire Oaks to be looked at. I was advised that the car has a battery issue, but Cheshire Oaks are not a high voltage garage and i need to ring Warrington. Beth Groom and Joe Woods told me its ok the to drive the car with that warning and that i was safe. I asked them to book the car with Warrington and they promised that they will assist me. After 5 days of emailing and ringing from my side and endless promises that i will get a call back without this happening the car broke down on Widnes bridge in the middle of the road and i almost got wiped out by a lorry. I rang Audi Chesh Oaks and told them they shouldn't have sent me with unsafe car away, and they organised AA to come and pick my car up and Audi A3 was the only option from Enterprise that i am driving now. I had to get a taxi from Widnes to Chester to collect the much smaller car. I bought a 4x4 for a reason..... Now i am struggling with the smaller car and not even sure what is going on with my car. This is the worst manufacturer and Aftersales team i worked with."
2023-01-23,5,"Friendly and efficient service, good job of the valeting offered with the service."
2023-01-23,5,"Great service by the team especially David and Kyle. Seamless exchange of cars and no issues along the way. Really happy with the new car, its style and features. The 4th consecutive VW we have purchased and hope to have many more."
2023-01-24,5,"A service for GLC. Whilst you wait option chosen with service complete efficiently and without any complications. Advisory work listed with pricing but no pressure to have works completed immediately. Happy with the good service, thank you."
2023-01-20,5,"Over the last 3 to 4 visits to VW Stockport, my contact has been Kayla Maguire. The service, knowledge, up to date info as to progress of work on my vehicle and overall professionalism is exceptional. She is a credit to your company, and huge asset to the Stockport branch. With this level of service from her, I will continue to support this branch."
2022-12-16,1,"Back on November 2022 My car had water droplets in the nearside front headlight. I booked in the car back in november 2022 and had a date of 16 dec to replace this (3 weeks ahead of when i booked)

car went in on 16th - and low and behold - they said when i called at the end of the day - that they didnt have the seals and that had to come from germany. No explanation as to why they hadnt checked before i had to take the car on the day of the booking. waste of my day and the car.

so had to take my car away. I then it had a fault immetiately in the following week in the electrics/mgt - so i took the car in as there were so many warnings.

the car has remained at the garage, over christmas, and is still there now (25/01/2023) so i had to hire a car to get to Brighton. Since then I have called several times, as the garage never tells you anything.

every time seems to be they have to go back to germany for yet more little bits at a time.

the latest is this week (now 25th jan) where i called on monday - and got no update. Garage called my tuesday morning saying it was going back in and they now had the seals.

no further updates. so i called again wednesday - no response to call. Called Thursday today - and been been told they now need some new parts from Germany -

In all Inchape Ipswich to not seem to know how to communicate between the front and back offices. They seem to have no understanding that my car has been on their courts since before christmas.

the garage seems to have no customer flagging issues /service and management for its customers and any escalations. I have had to call the garage each and every time to try and get an update.

Customer experience is awful. If i could give the 0% for process/management/service I do so.

I am now waiting apparently for yet more parts from germany.

I have no idea at the moment when i can expect the car to completed - maybe next week, because the garage is busy ...

Disaster on wheels all round."
2023-01-17,5,"Car was in for MOT & Service. Extra works was required, and Calum did a great job sorting out all the details and was most helpful and courteous, (really nice guy!)"
2023-01-23,5,Quick and easy process
2023-01-19,5,"I visited Inchcape Volkswagen to have my vehicle MOT'd and have a minor service + a possible repair to my offside shock absorber. Happily the shock absorber did not need changing. Jodie was very helpful and assisted me in signing up for another service contract, also she kept me in the loop about the progress of the work. Jodie gave excellent customer service she is an asset to Inchcape."
2023-01-14,5,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE ... WELL LOOKED AFTER.....
2023-01-16,5,"I have received the best customer service from Cheshire Oaks Audi.
Lisa managed my case for a faulty child lock, when I arrived at the garage I was stressed due to having a very poorly child.
Her care and compassion went a long way making sure so had a coffee she dealt with the issue and made regular check ins with me to explain the process.
Rather than just being about the car she asked how I was first then business after.

Once I received the video of what was happening to my car. Again very reassuring as previous Audi garages haven’t done this, I received my car back absolutely gleaming.

I would 100% recommend Cheshire Oaks Audi as the customer service is outstanding."
2023-01-07,5,Got a great deal on my new Toyota Aygo X . Thanks Keith Edwards at the Toyota dealer
2023-01-23,5,Joseph had informed me well about all the steps and everything went smooth as planned.
2023-01-18,5,"The inchcape Volkswagen Stockport garage in itself was a very aesthetically pleasing place to be. The hot chocolates were a 10/10.

I was seen by Kurt very quickly and efficiently. He made me feel very welcome and talked me through the Motability Scheme as I had not much of an idea how it worked.
He gave me lots of options, and was extremely honest about the timescale between ordering and the vehicle arriving, due to the current economic climate, as I expected there would be a wait in these uncertain times.
Kurt kept in touch with me throughout the process by way of video presentation emails, and phone calls. I felt in choosing to use VW Stockport to order a car with Kurt that the order was in safe hands.
When the car came it was better than I expected. Having not previously driven an automatic car Kurt talked me and showed me how it all works, and was very reassuring.
Getting this car has had such a positive impact on my life, I can now start to enjoy life again after being unable to get out of the house frequently.

Thankyou very much to Kurt and all at VW"
2023-01-19,5,"Gary Fear at Inchcape VW Swindon did a fantastic job in finding us the Golf that we wanted, helping us with the purchase and making sure everything went smoothly.

A brilliant all round service. Thanks very much!"
2023-01-23,5,"Great cars, great experience throughout the buying process. I like the Toyota app too."
2023-01-10,5,Excellent staff. Keep you updated all the timre
2023-01-07,5,We went there from London to trade in our Freelander that is not ulez compliant & pick up a Disco Sport. The dealership sorted out the glitches with the disco sport that came up after the test drive and delivered the car to us by the end of that week. We were very impressed.
2023-01-19,5,Very quick repair
2023-01-10,5,"My first ever visit to a Jaguar Dealer was so much better than what I got from the MG Dealer down the road. I was not pushed to buy other services. Spoke to politely and dealt with promptly by very helpful staff. The free coffee was very good as I sat and plucked up the courage to walk the mile and a half home in the pouring rain (a courtesy option of a lift home in such conditions would have been the icing on the cake, but it was not to be, however I now have the chance to voice this) Five hours later I received a phone call stating my car was all ready to be picked up. At over 60 years of age I was not looking forward to the walk back in the now dark and pouring rain. On arrival I was given my keys and charged the price I was quoted (with no hidden supprise extras) The car was cleaned inside and out and one happy customer left the Dealership not to worry about using them again in the future for services etc....Thank you to all concerned at Jaguar Slyfield Guildford."
2023-01-13,5,"Great work, friendly and professional people at every stage, from dropping off and collecting the car to the service people themselves. I genuinely recommend getting a service and MOT at the dealership."
2023-01-21,5,Super efficient and staff are great.
2023-01-06,5,"It was an amazing service from start to finish. I was kept informed every step of the way. My car came back like it was out of the showroom, the valet was best I have had.
Totally making this my go to dealership."
2023-01-07,5,"All staff were very welcoming. Carl helped me with the sale and was great throughout.
Would 100% recommend using Audi Approved Hyde, I have felt well looked after and I’m very happy with my new car!
After sale service was also great, any issues have been sorted promptly and communication with Carl was fast!
100% recommend."
2023-01-20,5,"I like to thank the both sale manager and the main manager helping to wards my full
Refund £17500 paid in full back thank u guys and wish u all the best take care puka"
2023-01-12,5,Audi spent some time investigating noise that I could hear - weren’t able to recreate noise in workshop but did a thorough check . Always good service from the garage
2023-01-09,5,"Excellent Service. Remy is first class - knowledgeable, friendly and passionate about the brand."
2023-01-16,5,"The service i have received from phillip at inchcape mercedes benz nottingham has been first class in the purchase of my new a class.
If you are thinking of a buying a new mercedes give phillip a call at inchcape nottingham and you wont be disappointed.
john markey"
2023-01-16,5,Excellent as always from start to finish and a really good deal on our new car. Consistently friendly and professional - what is not to like.
2023-01-17,5,"As always, the customer service I receive at Inchcape VW Altrincham is exceptional. Friendly and helpful staff, great communication and complete peace of mind. Thank you."
2023-01-19,1,"I have used Inchcape JLR in Derby twice and found that they mislead customers, try to mis-sell products that are not required and only completed about half of the £330 service resulting in their head technician having to complete the service a week later in front of my house. I've just had them call me trying to again sell me more products that are not required. Complete lack of customer service from this awful company"
2023-01-17,2,"Upon collecting the car. I was waiting 40 minutes to receive my keys, despite arranging the time upon booking.
I was informed this was due to the lack of advisors.
I was then handed my key and paper work by the receptionist, after chasing.
With absolutely no explanation of what work had been carried out.
Also to note, whoever valeted the car literally made the windscreen impossible to see out of.
Not impressed, especially for a luxury motor manufacturer.
Please note this is service and not sales."
2023-01-14,5,The sales staff were very helpful and knolagable. Great service all round
2023-01-01,5,Always friendly professional and attentive.
2023-01-16,5,Friendly attentive service manager and staff. Comfortable waiting area
2023-01-14,5,"Amazing service when purchasing my car last year.

Took my car to the Exeter branch for a service last week. Staff on entry very helpful, pointing me in the right direction, multiple members of staff wanting to help which was great. Very polite, swift and professional service from the services department."
2022-08-30,1,"Bought a used Mercedes from Inchape Cheshire Oaks. Mark Wilson did the ""hard sell"", but i needed a car quickly so i persevered. Mark Wilson only seemed able to communicate via text, and never returned any calls. Paid via bank transfer & as soon as they had the money their service all but stopped. As the day of delivery got closer, things started to go awry - Mark Wilson being very evasive (again only via txt & not responding to multiple phone calls) about the car's registration details and unable to produce a V5. Day before delivery, was sent a ""reference number"" that didn't match the vehicle so i was unable to tax it or get any confirmation that the car existed on the DVLA database. Smelling a rat, on the day of delivery with car on it's way to me, Mark Wilson admitted they had no registration details (for a £40k used car) and that I should go to the post office (an hour away from me!) fill in a V62 form to get the details from DVLA (with me paying the £25 fee to DVLA) to try to get it registered. So with no evidence that the car wasn't a ""cut and shut"" or something worse, needless to say, I said no way & rejected the vehicle. Surprise surprise, later in the day the V5 document was ""found"" in someones's draw. Mark Wilson's approach was more like a backstreet car dealer. His boss, Rick Gunby was equally laddish, couldn't care less & said ""oh yeah this is all normal""!. Took over a week of threatening emails and eventually threat of court action to get a refund out of Inchape. I eventually got a half hearted apology from a ""customer service rep"" at their head office, but it took weeks reminding them that i'd made a complaint. Overall an awful experience and i would absolutely recommend that people avoid Mercedes Inchape at Cheshire Oaks Ellesmere Port, unless you want to run the risk of them selling you a car with no registration details, an incorrect DVLA reference number, an inability to tax the vehicle, a possibility of it being previously ""written off"" or worse, and you having to do the runaround to sort out their mess!"
2023-01-05,5,Customer service was excellent. Drive in service area is excellent.
2023-01-16,1,"Pre-sales service very good. Post sales absolutely awful. Once they’ve got you that’s it!! They literally don’t know whether they’re coming or going

Save yourself a headache and go to Fairfield down the road!"
2023-01-13,5,Great deal on new GLC and perfect attentive service
2023-01-10,5,Very helpful and courteous staff
2023-01-11,5,Very good experience at Inchape Derby. Problem identified and fixed.
2023-01-09,5,Great service from start to finish. All the team did a great job and I felt truly looked after and extremely well informed about the works that needed to be completed. They completed very quickly and even arranged transport to and from the garage. Trust them 100%
2023-01-12,3,"The salesperson Henry was extremely helpful from start to finish. We were impressed with the reveal of our vehicle. However after driving away we were a little disappointed that our car mats were missing, there was a chip in the windscreen and tyre pressure warning light immediately came on all of the tyre pressures were low 245, 205, 180 & 180. We are returning to the showroom soon to pick up our car mats and swap number plates hopefully the screen issue can be sorted and the tyre pressures have been rectified already. Henry was extremely apologetic about our experience and we are confident that our issues will be resolved, not everything goes to plan in any transaction but a willingness to put things right shows the calibre of a company. Overall we had a great experience. Would highly recommend Derby Inchcape."
2023-01-12,5,"Thanks to the team at Inchcape, Macclesfield, we have just purchased our 6th consequetive brand new Polo. Very impressed and happy with the customer service, professionalism, and overall experience at Macclesfield VW."
2023-01-05,1,"Awful. Did not carry out the work we approved, did something else instead without approval, provided no paperwork for it and ignored 5 different requests for it and to discuss further. Disgusting level of service."
2023-01-11,5,Great customer service fantastic job video to show anything that was wrong with the car Swift appointment procedure and date to be seen and waited for me to arrive as we’re five minutes late due to traffic in Nottingham past closing time very professional delivery of service and customer care
2023-01-06,3,Was being told there is nothing wrong with the vehicle wen clearly there was a problem from the turbo valve. It’s now been sorted on the second visit
2022-12-17,5,"Incredible service.

Have recommended to a friend already. Will certainly be coming back!"
2023-01-04,5,Tanya and Connor superb!
2023-01-07,5,"Got my car from Mercedes Benz- North Wales, Lois was extremely friendly and nothing was to much hassle, she made the experience really smooth, great service."
2023-01-11,5,Excellent customer service provided by Mark throughout the repair to my SLC at Mercedes Llandudno.I was kept informed and the repair was carried quickly and effectively so I wasn’t without my car for long.The lady on reception who worked on a Friday was professional and lovely to speak to aswell.Top marks Mercedes and thanks for everything.
2023-01-04,1,Paid £99 for a diagnostic and didn’t even diagnose the problem which the “ Audi” approved mechanics should have picked up on. Waste of money would never recommend audi to anyone.
2023-01-06,5,A lot of businesses use the term “service” but when Mercedes of Stratford upon Avon look after my car I always feel that the term service is used correctly. My last minute requests were met with professionalism and completely fulfilled when perhaps realistically they shouldn’t have been. A big thank you to technical staff to the Service Dept. This praise is fully deserved.
2023-01-04,5,"Lee-Ann provided an amazing service experience from start to finish, was always communicative, and in touch."
2023-01-06,5,It was a excellent service Helena was great in keeping me informed amazing video I am very please
2023-01-04,5,First class service throughout. Polite professional staff.
2023-01-09,5,Was very nervous as I’ve never sold a car before. I found this firm very straightforward to deal with. I was happy with the price I was offered for my car. They paid the full offer price with no quibbling. I would use this firm again.
2022-08-17,1,"Absolutely awful. Car come out worse than it went in. They admit doing it but won’t fix it. Avoid

Update to reply:
You know I have and you refused to fix the issues. So your answer is just another lie.
Ps tell your staff to be more professional to"
2023-01-06,5,"Excellent service from start to finish, I was kept up to date regularly by Ste whilst my car was getting fixed at Mercedes Liverpool."
2022-12-19,5,"Brilliant from start to finish. We spotted the car we liked at Inchcape JLR Derby, took it for a test drive that visit. Decided we liked it and picked it up 2 days later, all prepped and MOT'd. The payment process was easy. The best bit however, and something I've never experienced was the handing over process in the showroom. All very easy and straightforward, but it's often the small things that make it memorable. Keys handed over in a presentation box with Jaguar keyrings. I thought the sales rep, Craig, was joking when he said the car was behind him as that was under a black cover. I thought it was some new model waiting for a product launch. No, it was our car and I got to reveal it whilst my hubby video'd me. Craig took me through the main features of the car, there are a few on an F-Pace, and then we were free to go. I've never driven out of a showroom before and I'm still pinching myself that the car is ours. It's amazing to drive, and made all the better by the buying experience at Inchcape Derby."
2023-01-01,5,The sales manager Jonathan and salesman Hassan were excellent
2023-01-06,5,"Joseph was really helpful, responsive and efficient."
2023-01-06,5,Joseph made it so easy to sell my car. Very patient and helpful. Literally same day sell and pay. Thankyou
2022-12-30,5,"Great service, friendly staff."
2022-11-07,1,Very pushy and try to deceive the customer with being dishonest to them
2023-01-05,1,"Purchased a used discovery sport, had it for three weeks and it had to go in for an mot, only to fail and the part required will take another eight weeks to arrive. Whilst this is not their fault which I understand, the replacement car is not of similar size or quality and not practical for what I purchased the original car for. The communication has been shocking at best."
2022-12-28,5,"It was great experience specially with the sales assistant mr Jas Dhani, he was so helpful as well as very professional. I would happily recommend to my family and friends to do business with you guys. Just one thing I was not satisfied is the issue of mot certificate and v5c, obviously it was not sales team fault, but overall it was memorable experience. Thanks for the service."
2022-09-15,1,"It took over 4 visits to Mercedes Benz of Coventry to diagnose the problem with my car before seeking advice from Mercedes themselves, having numerous hire cars, having to miss work and hospital appointments with the backwards and forwards taking my vehicle to the garage, with no offer of any form of compensation for the inconvenience of it all even after going to the Vehicle Standards agency so the car manufacturer always win!! I will never own a Mercedes again as this is the worst experience I have had owning a vehicle for over 30 years. I even had to chase for updates as the garage would not contact me. All in all the garage had my vehicle for nearly six weeks, I had only had it for five before the fault developed. Brand new car!!"
2022-11-26,4,Great customer service
2022-12-21,5,"James Merritt was the contact point for my service, all work was carried out with the car returned cleaned too. The service provided by James was excellent with good customer service provided by him. I will certainly return for future services and work and maybe new vehicle. He is a credit to your team and would certainly recommend others to have work carried out at your location. Everything from booking to updates of vehicle progress all came to me prior to collection and payment online made it easier as able to pay before picking car up making the process easier
Well done Mercedes"
2023-01-03,1,"Ordered a new E-Pace from JLR online and paid £750 deposit. Got a phone call from Inhcape Preston wanting another £250 deposit. One year later with no car and cancelled build, cancelled my order. Got my £750 back from JLR but not the £250 from Inchcape Preston despited repeated emails. Sharp practice - avoid!"
2022-12-12,2,Better communications. Vehicle breakdown and was recovered to Inchcape Kings Lynn. We had to keep contacting them for updates on the vehicle repair. Being told it was something different every time. It wasn't until we complained that someone took ownership and we then got a bit better communications.
2022-12-30,5,"Great staff, very helpful"
2022-12-29,5,The Staff as always efficient and very helpful.
2022-12-30,5,always ready to help.

Nothing but excuses and avoiding problems"
2022-12-29,5,Excellent service received.
2022-12-29,4,"Excellent really, I would have given 5 stars, but I had to wait several weeks to get an appointment? Richard in service was excellent as usual!"
2022-12-15,1,"Can you seriously believe this…..

My 85 year old disabled father had been left without his car by Inchcape Derby.
Correction.... they left him a courtesy car - but no key !!!! .... Laughable!

The treatment towards him has been outrageous. The battery was within its warranty period and both Landrover and Inchcape spent 2 weeks battling it out as to who should pay for it. Guess what …. They believed my father should pay. In the end, they all took a share of the cost. It was under warranty and there had never been anything in writing to advise otherwise. Appalling behaviour on their part. I gave up dealing with Hunters - now Inchcape years ago. The service really is disgraceful - always has been. If you haven’t already used them … Marshall’s in Melton Mowbray are fantastic. Inchcape could learn a lot from them. Come on guys - it’s Christmas- be fair and reasonable to an elderly, frail gentleman and not be such bullies!"
2022-12-28,5,Professional and keep you informed throughout the service experience
2022-12-15,5,"Georgia was brilliant, informative kind and very helpful. A real credit to Land Rover. Thank you!
Service was fabulous"
2022-12-22,5,"Excellent service by Service manager Bryony and Technician Jake.
Credit to Audi. Great job as always. Thank you."
2022-12-07,3,"The booking / car drop-off etc. was well organised; however, the mechanic work is not so good. I asked for the calibration of the wheel alignment to be checked as part of the service. Unfortuantely, despite costing £240 extra, the steering has been made worse and is now not as tight / less responsive. Frustrating for a sports car and the fact that this was the vehicle's first service."
2022-12-22,5,Excellent service from Josh who went the extra mile to ensure that I got my car on the day I needed it before Christmas.
2022-12-23,5,"Fast, efficient trade in and delivery of used vehicle."
2022-12-17,1,"Very poor, service! Dropped a car for a full service felt it was very much rushed as they open only half day; got a car back within 2 hours with a long windscreen crack; was meant to contact us yesterday, no news- called to check what’s happening someone said the responsible person would contact us yesterday still waiting to hear from them for a solution another day; very disappointed for the service received🥲; still no response despite calling twice spoken to very rude manager; after buying 2 Mercedes cars within 7 years, I am not sure whether I buy again or anyone to recommend buying from them"
2022-12-23,5,"Great experience at Mercedes Leicester, thanks to Sean and Jack for looking after me from start to finish, love my new car 😊"
2022-12-23,5,"Dealt with Mike Scott. He was a pleasure to deal with. Good communication, did not need to be chased, honest and clear with his messages.
Best car handover we have had - I have had in excess of 15 cars and paid over 4x as much for some cars but this was the most comprehensive and useful I have experienced.
The only negative was the inability of VW to source winter wheels and tyres either now or to be able to guarantee they could do so in the future. For a massive company that sells in numerous cold countries this is a major issue.
My daughter is very happy with her car and really appreciated the surprise treats that Mike left for her."
2022-12-23,5,"In general, excellent service with a lot of kindness, highlighting the sales executive Sophina Evans."
2022-12-23,5,Friendly courteous staff. Lisa our sales executive made the whole experience of buying a car a joy.
2022-12-20,1,"The vehicle hasn’t been fixed in the slightest, it’s worse and has caused me to nearly have an accident on Christmas Day, again due to the gearbox putting itself into neutral and not being drivable in 1st-3rd. It’s been rushed due to the reluctance of providing a courtesy car and it will now be needed to be brought in again due to cutting corners. The worst garage I’ve had to deal with and the fact I now won’t have a vehicle again for weeks is quite simply ridiculous. I’m an emergency service worker who can no longer have a vehicle during the busiest time of the year to get to work and at a time when there are no trains, exacerbated by Volkswagen rushing a job."
2022-12-19,5,"James is an asset to the company, very friendly, knowledgeable and able to provide in detail insight of everything despite being an online/ over the phone purchase."
2022-12-21,2,"Hello everyone. I've had my three door Up GTI for just over a year now. About 4 months ago whilst driving along I started to get a progressively worsening clunk everytime I changed gear. After a few minutes of this getting worse I pulled the car over and rang the AA. The mechanic thought it could be the rear engine mount and tightened it up which seemed to improve things. I put it in to Inchcape in Chester and they stripped the mount, inspected it and found no issue. About 6 weeks later I pulled up at a junction and it started making the same clanking noise from the engine bay and I could feel a thumping through the footwell. Again I contacted the AA, again the mechanic couldn't pinpoint the fault. I booked it into Inchcape Chester again but due to an 11 day lead the the fault had gone away by the time the appointment came round so I never bothered taking it. Finally about 3 weeks ago I came out of the supermarket and put it in reverse and it sound like the gearbox was going to fall out. I drove it home and the thumping and clank every gear change was back. I've put it into Inchcape, again had to wait 11 days by which time the fault had disappeared again. They said they can find no fault with the vehicle. During all of this I have contacted VW customer services about 7 or 8 times and it's basically back to square one every time. All the while my warranty is ticking down. I have escalated it with customer service and have been told a more senior representative will call me back. I've been told this on three separate occasions and guess what, I've not had a call from them yet. This is the third Up I've bought in four years, my daughter and wife have one. My daughters has been great. My wife's developed a brake problem and went into Inchcape Wirral to be repaired. They said it had been fixed but 3 weeks later the fault returned. The AA mechanic who attended said not to drive the car as the brakes could fail. It went back into Inchcape Wirral and they diagnosed and replaced a leaking master cylinder. I think the first time they just topped up the brake fluid and gave my wife back a car with a potentially fatal fault on it. I dread to think what might have happened if the brakes failed at high speed. I'm worried that the fault on my Up could also cause a catastrophic failure. Inchcape admitted that since they can't diagnose the problem they are unable to rule that out. I feel that I have been extremely shoddily treated by both VW customer services and Inchcape. I feel like it's a case of we've had your money now go away. It's highly unlikely I'll be buying another VAG vehicle and I certainly would not recommend them."
2022-12-21,5,The staff here are very helpful and are easy to contact. My experience has been very positive.
2022-12-18,5,The staff were amazing and helpful at every stage. There was me stress involved it was an easy process.
2022-12-22,5,"Truck had a recall and service …. Everything went smoothly and was super easy. Loan car was provided. The staff were excellent, friendly and helpful. The whole experience from buying the vehicle to now has been great. This is the 2nd Toyota I’ve brought from Inchcape… and the service has been excellent throughout. I would not hesitate recommend Inchcape for their service and Toyota for their vehicles 👍🏽👍🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽"
2022-12-19,5,"A, very polite & friendly, driver collected my car & a while later the lady who was servicing my vehicle called me to double check exactly what needed to be done. She was, also, very polite & friendly. Overall, a very positive experience, thankyou."
2022-12-20,5,"Amazing service from start to finish yet again! Andrea and Hollie at the Warrington branch have been fantastic (as always), Andrea sorted my car out just before Christmas! Thank you ladies for getting my car fixed so quick and efficient"
2022-12-22,5,Collected car from work and delivered back ahead of time. Emily kept me informed all the way.
2022-12-21,2,"Booked in for brake pads and discs, front and rear (as that’s what I’d been told I needed by Warrington branch) asked if I could come in early as possible as I needed to have left by 3pm. Told on the phone that the earliest was 9:45. I arrived at 9:40. Wasn’t seen by anyone for about 20mins. Was then told they wanted to do another health check first. They took my keys and I sat and waited 2.5 for them to do this. First person came back to me and said it was only rear I needed and then someone else came back 20 mins later and said it was the front pads and discs and that the tyre I also wanted replaced hadn’t turned up. Luckily I was eventually put in a courtesy vehicle around 1pm. The car I was given said it had 100 miles left in tank. I had driven about 15 minutes and it was on empty. I panicked to try and find a fuel station and tried to ring the branch to find out what fuel was required. 25 mins later, still no answer from anyone. Eventually I managed to ask someone at the fuel station who could tell me after being sat in there 40 minutes. Not impressed at all to be honest."
2022-12-17,2,"Picked up new car salesman had to clean it scuffs on trim, stains on seat, was promised extra warranty then told I had to pay for it, booked car in for a heater problem the next day, vibrating up steering column, poor experience, although the sales guy was new he was very polite and did his best to resolve issues, no senior person came out to apologise. Spent over 100K with this branch in last 5 years, will consider elsewhere in future."
2022-12-19,2,"Confusion when arriving as the text said to arrive at Toyota burton at 9.00 but they were going to collect from my home luckily the driver had not left the service centre so he didn't waste his time unfortunately they couldn't return the car to me so i had to collect it.
the video showing the service was very poor as it only mentioned the underneath of the car no engine or other parts of the car mentioned, on collecting the car i had to wait 20 minutes as they could not find my service plan agreement, I would have thought for the cost of the service they would have at least washed the car and gave it a vacuum out as most service centres do , the staff were very friendly and the reception area very nice."
2022-12-01,1,"Be very careful and sure of what you are getting when ordering parts online. In fact, I would go elsewhere, as if you have a problem, you are unreservedly ignored. No reply to e-mails or calls, even when the item being sold is potentially misrepresented, and therefore dangerous. This may be a small issue, but could reflect working practices to much more important parts. Brakes, anything. Ordered Valve Caps with Tyre Pressure monitoring (a common enough item) for daughter's Audi, as hopeless at checking pressures and had a close call. The product is nothing more than overpriced dust caps, that do not monitor tyre pressures at all. Unnoticed, I could have put my faith in these to keep my daughter safe. Instead they may have done the opposite. I likely would not have reviewed but for the total arrogance of this company. I put this to an unamed motor spares outlet, and they agreed with my summary in full."
2022-12-15,3,Service staff superb sales staff appalling
2022-12-13,5,"Everything was done to the usual Lexus high standards, work completed on time, car washed and cleaned inside, meeting room provided whilst I was waiting with coffee provided. What more could you ask for in a service - nothing really."
2022-12-21,5,Straight forward process with great customer service.
2022-12-19,5,"Excellent service. Friendly staff, trustworthy expertise"
2022-12-21,1,"So today my car that I paid £28k developed a leak through the interior mirror. Warranty I thought. Well guess what it doesn’t cover water ingress!! Stay away from this company they take your money, promise you everything and deliver nothing!!! Wanted me to spend £500 to diagnose the fault then fix it for nothing under the warranty. Fraudsters at best. No loyalty and therefore if you want to purchase a nice nearly new car and have main stealer benefits then don’t come to Inchcape Volkswagen Telford."
2022-12-16,5,I cant believe how smooth and easy this sale was. Huge thank you to Joseph co-ordinating the sale and the team at Inchape Reading for completing it.
2022-12-17,1,"I travelled an hour from my address for the winter check. The email from Toyota requesting me to go for a winter check says you will get your fluid checked and topped (coolant, oil & screen wash) - None of this was done.
The email says you will get a free winter kit (Ice scraper & De-Icer) - None of this was given.
The email says we'll wash and vacuum your vehicle for FREE- None of this was done.

Please why was I charged this amount and made to travel this distance for no reason?

This is just upsetting1"

Warm & welcoming experience with beverages offered upon arrival."
2022-12-15,5,MOT completed in line with booking while I waited. Car cleaned inside and outside despite freezing temperature outside. Very friendly staff and efficient service.
2022-12-20,5,It was a pleasure dealing with Joseph Vaughan and Gavin Doody - both were extremely helpful during the whole process. Couldn’t recommend Inchcape high enough.
2022-12-16,5,Very helpful both ends of a one way hire.
2022-12-19,5,Excellent service. Really helpful and good with all his advice
2022-12-19,5,helpful and accommodating - had to wait an extra week due to personnal issues and they were very understanding
2022-12-16,3,"Overall I wasn’t impressed with the service received initially at Mercedes Oxford. I dropped the car off at 0830 and when I arrived back at 1730 it was still in the workshop. By the time they finished the valet team had gone home and they had not been able to clean the car or carry out most of the additional work it was booked in for except the basic service. I was actually very dissatisfied at this point especially with the explanation to the start/stop issue which the mechanic didn’t even look at and just said it’s probably because I do short journeys and it’s cold. This being despite the fact it hasn’t worked for many months and I drive 45 miles each way to work on the motorway.

That being said Katie the Service Agent was fantastic and went out of her way to try to do as much as she could. She even arranged for some office staff to clean the car and found an air con sanitiser which was booked in for and they hadn’t done. If it wasn’t for her customer service I would leave 1 star and it is only because of her I have given it three. I would rate her service five stars but I can’t In all honesty rate the experience as five stars as it wasn’t great. I now have to return in January and take another day off work to have the car looked at again for all the work they didn’t have time to do."
2022-12-08,5,"My experience was great because the person handling the appointment was the same from the first telephone call to completion. She kept me informed throughout the process and was supremely professional, informative and very personable.
Customer relations appear to be important to this company."
2022-12-16,5,"Efficient, friendly and fast. Great communication."
2022-12-17,2,"I was sold a car with much higher mileage than advertised.Only discovered after payment.They didn't seem to care
Near zero petrol to get home
Subsequent independent checks revealed faulty front wheel.No MOT certificate offered at the time.Now looked at MOT online done on handover day indicating corroded coil springs and tyre very near illegal limit.Correct mileage on MOT whilst incorrect on other paperwork. Oil was low and screen wash empty.Filthy engine bay.Missing fasteners on moulding.
Simply awful company
Individual handover sales person was great only to be badly let down by her team.

Now faced with getting car fixed and fully checked at my cost at Xmas."
2022-12-05,1,"This was simply the worst consumer service experience I have ever had !!!
Frankly, there is too much information to pass here, but I have already briefed the manufacturer !!!!"
2022-12-08,5,Harry and Mike always go above and beyond to cater to my needs and did so effortlessly. Thank you so much for your amazing service and delivering my car to my home it was great but I did miss seeing you both!

Whilst there I spoke to Fabion Blake in sales regarding possible upgrade to my car. He listened , I didn’t feel rushed and didn’t feel pressured overall very good experience. Kishor popat"
2022-12-01,4,"Although I experienced issues during a major F PACE service and MOT at the Guildford Dealership and some difficulty initially in being able to speak with the Service Manager, I have now been able to discuss these in detail with both the Customer Experience Team and the Service Manager who both spent time going through and addressing each item in detail. This was reassuring and hopefully will ensure these will not be repeated in the future"
2022-12-14,1,"Awful customer service from Incape BMW Reading from their after sales team from a kid called Sam who has such appalling communication skills I’m surprised he knew how to pick up a phone let alone dial out to customers.

I purchased a BMW from their reading branch and within the first week I noticed the speaker on the sound system made a rattling noise. Within two weeks of owning the car (I just paid £16k for) both batteries on both sets of keys needed replacing almost leaving me stranded at work. Not to mention the scratched second key they gave me.

Emailed Incape to rectify this and received a response same day, replied within an hour and then had to chase a response 4 days later to confirm an appointment as apparently their customer service doesn’t extend past tricking you into separating with your hard earned cash.
They then clearly asked the new guy to call and arrange for me to bring the car down. Despite being promised an appointment and a loan car while they checked out the faulty speaker on the original email they sent, Sammy boy refused to book it in for an appointment until it had been checked over.
If discovered to be faulty he then expected me to book it in and return the following week.
Because Sam in his infinite wisdom believed he knows better than the customer who is telling him it’s faulty.
So I am expected two take two 40mile trips there and back just to prove to this guy there is indeed a problem with the sound system.
Laughable at best.
When I said this wasn’t acceptable he started giving attitude to which I asked him to drop the attitude as this isn’t appropriate customer service. He laughed and then said “you don’t pay my bills”. Obviously this kid needs a quick lesson on how his wages are generated LOL.
I emailed to raise a complaint with Incape straight after the call and surprise surprise, no response.
Worst service I’ve ever had buying a car, worst customer service I’ve ever experienced and I will be contacting the head office along with senior managers via Linkdin to raise a formal complaint to have the phone call listened to and Sammy boy given some training which he so clearly needs.
Ohh and btw you just lost another £20k in business due to Sam."
2022-12-13,1,"I purchased a ""VW approved car"" from Inchcape Chester. They weren't honest about the state of the car, I found out after a couple of weeks by having a health check that the car won't pass its first MOT. After arguing with them on this matter, I gave up and 8 months to go, the car became a pool of water. I went this time to Inchcape Bury branch and left the car with them for further investigations. After a health check I received an email telling me the cost of the water checks + stripping carpets and dry was around 400 pounds. I told them to carry on the water checks but only because it was a time wasting,complicated job I was advised to go to Chester as warranty won't cover anything. I agreed and when picking up the car ,they charged me around 300 pounds, even if everything was as before, water inside the car. I checked on my dashcam inside, nothing else was done to the car , except a health check. This is fraudulent and illegal!!! Avoid at all costs"
2022-11-21,1,"Autobravo Cheltenham,
Reserved a vehicle by paying the £99.00 where the payment swiftly went from account in November; the vehicle was held for a few days. I didn’t go ahead with the purchase as my private car sale fell through, so spoke to one of the managers at the forecourt over the phone of the situation in November, the request of refundable reservation payment should have been processed on the day.
Instead when a couple of emails later after 7+ days had passed the refund has only just been processed today December. So thanks for that, you take the money quick but don’t return it to the owner as quick as you take it.
Customer service out of 5, 3 stars.
Acknowledging customers requests and enquiries 0 stars.
Improvement required maybe more training for staff to put the customer first."

2022-12-10,1,"I ordered a Range Rover from Inchcape Chester and paid the £1,000 fully refundable deposit which is standard Land Rover practice.

I subsequently cancelled the order and requested that Inchcape return the £1,000 deposit.

Inchcape agreed to return the deposit however the deposit was not returned.

I contacted Inchcape again and was told that the return of the deposit would be 'chased up'. A month went by and still no refund or contact from Inchcape.

I have now had to initiate a chargeback from the bank via Mastercard. If Inchcape still fail to return the deposit it's a trip to court.

This dealership was previously named Hunters Land Rover and they were a shambles, unbelievably they have got worse. Why be so difficult, what do Inchcape hope to gain?"

2022-12-06,5,"Dealt with efficiently and swiftly. Things that need to be arranged and pushed forward were done quickly and without confusion and I was kept aware of what was happening and when every step of the way. The only problem and it’s a very small one is that my courtesy car was given with no petrol so I had to guess and pay for how much I’d use over the day and that was given back with a lot more than it was given with, a full tank received with a full tank returned would’ve cancelled out this issue. Other than that a flawless service."
2022-12-06,5,Professional as always. I requested as soon as possible due to child care arrangements that came up on the day and they turned it round quicker which save me a lot of issues.

2022-12-06,1,"HORRIBLE SERVICE ! DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM Stockport !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I purchased a car back in June 2022 from here and it has been a total NIGHTMARE since! Within 6 weeks of owning the car it broke down and they wanted me to pay to fix it even though i paid for 4 years warranty! After 14 days the team at Chester kindly sorted the issue for me with NO help from stockpot they couldn't even be bothered calling or emailing me back and asked me to drive it to them which is 1hr away i dont know what they didn't understand by it has broken down. Seems like the ""Sales Manger"" doesn't know how to use a phone. I am 20 years old and I feel like I'm being treated like I dont matter as they think I won't do anything!
Below list of issues -
1. USB broken
2. brake paddle rubber missing - driving round with just the metal PS. this is a MOT Fail so unsure how it got through there teams !
3. masking tape over light then resprayed over
4. scuffed alloys - i was advised this was meant to be fixed before collection but the sales guy said they didnt have time so i can claim - left out the key part that i had to pay!
5.bonnet out of line and the paint work looks like something a child could have made a better job out of !
6. i bought the car in summer and i was given a part worn road tire and three new snow tires very unsure what that is all about.
I have raised this with Customer care 5 times and have taken this further with legal action as they dont seem intrested in me or trying to help me.
I have called over 50 times requesting to speak to a manager however they are currently all on holiday when i ring !
I'm unsure how a company can leave a customer with these issues then not expect you to leave a bad review.
Threatening legal action and crying down the phone doesn't get you anywhere!
DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hopefully a manger will get back to me know 🙂"

2022-11-28,3,"My CLK had minor faults, parking sensors, phone connection, and after a drive/parked the cooling fan is still running.
These can be fixed by loughborough's very professional/experienced service team, you know when in their hands run by Chris North the outcome will be perfect - he is sadly missed when he has days off. The downside is the valeting which ruins the whole mercedes benz experience. Windows not cleaned, the carpet behind the front seats never hoovered, an odd piece of plastic appeared on the floor. Apparently now cleaning this area/or cleaning the back/ side windows if not allowed - why bother at all - this only takes seconds and gives the impression you actually care about the state of the client's car when it is collected by them.

In all the years i have been a client of Inchcape. with numerous new mercedes cars have i been so disgusted, makes you wonder what will go next - maybe no valeting at all.

This always has for my 17years of being a client of Inchcape loughborough, a fantastic dealership, and a pleasure to deal with - this experience makes you wonder for the future"

Last time I buy Mercedes after having e classes for 12 years the standard of the company has gone to pot

Rude staff
Hard to make service bookings
Didn’t even get offered a drink
Miss communication between central bookings line and actual servicing garage
Poor availability of loan cars

Awful"
2022-11-24,1,"Not one to write up bad reviews, but I felt I had to provide feedback somehow- poor service through and through, with little care for customer experience, falling far short of the mark expected for luxury brands; catastrophic compared to local BMW and even VW dealers. Took car in for a routine service and aircon fault investigation due to poor AC performance, got it back serviced but with aircon completely broken, despite claim they'd fixed it.

They then refused to pick up the car because it was now a repair, not a service, and couldn't offer a repair slot for nearly a month. No empathy from the booking staff or expedience given the car was returned faulty, and it took me calling up repeatedly to even get booked in after being passed between the bookings and service team repeatedly with promises to call back that were rarely fulfilled (points to Dave in the workshop, who did, but points deducted for the faulty phone that meant I only got about two thirds of each sentence every time he called).

Add to this a long wait to pay for said service - a simple card transaction that took seconds in the end - while staff sat around chatting, plus snarky comments from reception staff about the wait, and it's fair to say I'll be avoiding Mercedes and Inchcape for the next car."
2022-11-25,5,"Richard was very friendly and informative.
Dropped my car off the night before thw service was due and I picked it up the following afternoon. Was kept up to date and made to feel a valued customer."
2022-11-25,5,"Kayla Maguire was a fantastic representative of the business, she went above on beyond with the repair work carried out on my vehicle.

I went in for a simple disc and brake pad replacement and got a complimentary car clean and a visual vehicle inspection to bring up issues with my car that I wasn't aware of.

Thank you very much Kayla & Inchcape"
2022-11-26,5,Lexus provide a top rate customer experience with attention to detail. The service is consistently informative and efficient both on calls and face to face service. Every team member has professional levels of Customer Service. We are never disappointed with the level of service provided.
2022-11-24,5,New car arrived earlier than expected. Prepared for collection in a timely manner. Good price for the old car traded in. Paperwork explained and handled efficiently. 3 Days car insurance included - which gave ample time to transfer the Insurance from the old to the new car.
2022-11-25,1,"They were not welcoming whatsoever. I was promised a complimentary clean and hoover of my car which I didn’t receive. I was told I would receive a call before 4pm and didn’t and then I eventually called at 5pm and they told me to get there before 5:30pm since they’re closing. I found them to be quite inconsiderate and will not be returning. In the future, promises should be fulfilled and when not an explanation at least should be offered."
2022-11-26,5,Very friendly and helpful staff. Everything was ready when I arrived and the job was completed on time.
2022-11-25,5,Great service and personal one to one attentiveness was good and most importantly not pushy
2022-11-25,5,"Great service at Mercedes, Warrington."
2022-11-17,5,Excellent service & pleasant staff.Good follow up service as well.
2022-11-24,5,"The sales staff provided a first-class service with absolute attention to detail and product knowledge.
The help and service we received during the purchase of our new vehicle can only be described as outstanding."
2022-11-25,5,"Incredibly friendly and attentive staff upon arrival at Mercedes-Benz of Warrington, the mechanic's seemed very competent and they were nice enough to provide us with a free health check despite only being there due to a safety recall relating to the airbags replacement."
2022-11-24,5,"The team sorted out a new VW for prompt delivery in three weeks and the price worked.
Theo and Liam really could not have done more...thank you both."
2022-11-24,5,"Easy drop off.
Courteous reception.
Efficient service time."
2022-11-22,5,Detailed report of vehicle with video inspection.
2022-11-13,5,"Chris Hunter is an exceptional ambassador for VW and really went above and beyond to ensure we had a car we were looking for. The other members of the team from the receptionist to the cleaning staff were friendly and welcoming, even on a Sunday afternoon everyone was smiling and seemed happy to be at work - which shows a great leadership team and work atmosphere. Well Done Inchcape.

Highly recommend Chris and the team."
2022-11-01,5,"Amazing remote experience.

Joshua was just amazing, he helped us choose the perfect car, with a great customer service and outstanding communication skills."
2022-11-25,1,"Cheshire Oaks, Inchcape do not respect privacy laws because since taking a car in for a service we have been bombarded with phone calls and emails without explicit permission, offering services or car deals.

Never buying a Mercedes again because of this awful company, and also reporting it to the ICO for breach of privacy legislation."
2022-11-25,5,"Being an OAP, the guy I dealt with in customer services was very helpful and patient. Very knowledgeable and answered any questions that I had. Pleasant on the phone and did not rush things. Would not hesitate to use again, if needed, in the future."
2022-11-21,5,its just nice that you are welcome to the place where you decide to buy and you are assisted nicely without hesitation he did it well
2022-11-24,2,"• Aggressive and over assertive business manager, nearly caused me to walk out except the car fitted my requirements stopped me.
• E mail system did not work or no reply.
• I had to make three enquiries to confirm my payment had been made + one non return of call.
• Sales person’s product knowledge? Sports mode should be selected on motorways to go faster? Head lights set at number 4 for normal use.
• Sales person ‘demanded’ I filled in a survey on her in her presence (the only reason I did was to get out of the place as quickly as I could.) Any survey done in this way is not worth the paper it is written on.
• I discovered there was no service record or info book in the car also informed there was no second key . Collect following week.
• Car well prepared.
• Parts department very helpful.
• Overall a pretty bad sales experience"
2022-11-24,5,"I wanted to sell my Audi but not p/x. Usually you go to a dealership and they look your car over, obviously try and give you the minimum. But this was different; I got an online valuation, was honest about the one small niggle and was given a figure a fair bit above my local and not very friendly local dealership.The figure came from a centralised buying unit. I only had to go a few miles and there was no haggling etc. Handed keys etc over and received the money within a few hours. So leaving aside the fact that it was a new procedure to me it was great; everything done online until you actually go to the showroom and i was in and out in 15 mins; well done Inchcape and Joseph Vaughan"
2022-11-24,1,"The car is fine. However the constant badgering from them is seriosuly annoying. Numerous inane texts about nothing, unsoliceted phone calls about erroneous issues. It's paramount to harrassment. Please stop."
2022-11-24,5,We chose to sell our car to Inchcape rather than as part exchange for our new car. The price offered was competitive and the process straightforward; thanks to Joseph and team. No haggling and everything was transparent and clear. Would definitely recommend.
2022-11-22,5,"No issues whatsoever.
I was promptly attended to upon my arrival to drop off my vehicle, and I was promptly attended to upon my return to collect my vehicle.
All the staff on the front desk were pleasant, friendly and polite.
And the lady who handed my keys back (I think was Amy/Aimee) also did so with a smile on her face.

When customers are given service with politeness and courteousness, it makes them want to return.

Well done TeamWarrington !!!"
2022-11-16,4,"Previously the car had been serviced by Toyota Guildford Moorfield Rd, so it was the first time in many years I have been into Sandhurst. Sandhurst is smaller more friendly than Guildford which is rather choc a block .I felt they took more care did a more thorough job and expressed a greater interest than Guildford."
2022-11-19,5,Danny our salesman was knowledgeable and clearly explained the workings of the car. He was patient and quick to respond to any questions I had throughout the process. Changing cars I find stressful but Danny helped make it less so and I believe it’s the easiest change over yet. Love the car too.
2022-11-11,5,Heidi Chapman is a real asset to JLR Kings Lynn. She made the whole process simple and experience was exceptional. Couldn’t recommend her enough.. Such a service should really be praised and recognised.
2022-11-03,1,"BMW Chelmsford, Challenging to get a response. Car went in for service and warranty inspection on trims which have unexpectedly discoloured. Told by service advisor Jack, pictures taken and sent to warranty department for assessment, he confirmed he could see they had gone purple. Have chased up 4 times, no call back from Jack, last time I spoke to Beth, who asked me to bring the car in so they could have a look, which I questioned as that is not good use of my time!! Told by Beth, she was sitting next to Jack, one of them would call me back 😂😂😂😂
very poor, don’t care service!"
2022-11-17,5,All went very smoothly and punctually (important because I had to travel to a course in Manchester). I had been advised to bring licence and insurance documents prior to the takeover of the service car. This pickup was quickly arranged. My car was serviced and thoroughly valeted by early afternoon and ready for pickup. I was advised by phone of replacement wipers needed and about the availability of my car. It runs fine and I appreciate the extension of the warranty by one year. All aspects of the transactions were conducted courteously. Many thanks.
2022-11-21,5,The process of selling my car via Inchcape was straightforward and problem-free. My case was handled by Joseph Vaughan who came across as professional as well as adding the personal touch with help and advice and was sympathetic to my current situation as I lost my partner 2 months ago and selling his car was quite a sad time for me.
2022-11-14,5,"Wonderful experience from start to finish!
5 star customer service from Sarah. She was a pleasure to meet and very very helpful."
2022-11-16,5,Excellent friendly service.
2022-11-10,5,Excellent service from start to pick up this how it should be
2022-11-11,5,Absolutely outstanding service from start to finish from Chris. I had an issue with my van which required VW assist to come out. They advised i get it into a service centre asap and past the notes down to the Preston VW who were useless to say the least. After ringing round several different departments at the service centre and Preston site I decided to give the Manchester VW a call as this is where I purchased the van. Chris put me at ease straight away and my van was in the workshop and being looked at within 24 hours and I was on the road in a courtesy vehicle within 30 minutes of me dropping the van off. This experience has made me ensure I only ever use this site for anything I need on the vehicle. Could not recommend this branch enough. Thanks again Chris.
2022-11-16,2,"My car went into Mercedes Benz of Liverpool for a bumper realignment upon having my car all day I was told late in the day to come and pick it up as it was ready, upon my arrival I was given my key back and told the car was in the parking lot, upon my inspection I was totally amazed to fine the bumper was in a worsted state now as to when I put it into the repair, I now have to rebook to have it repaired again to say I’m disgusted is an understatement"
2022-11-15,1,"I purchased a brand-new VW Polo in 2013. A car that I had to wait several months for it to be manufactured and delivered. Upon delivery, car presented few quality issues. Over the years I have complained and complained but the service VW Inchcape provided is the worst ever! They can never find faults, never provide good service. I eventually went to Financial Ombudsman to present and help me in my case. They ruled in my favour and the car was returned and money refunded with a little compensation.
Fine.
I then went on to 2 BMW’s since. A 3 series and then a 5 series. NO ISSUE AT ALL… NEVER… VERY GOOD CARS… NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES EITHER.
I sold my 5 series during pandemic as there was no use for it. I then came to a point that I needed a car. I decided that this time round I will go for a better and more expensive VW Passat R Line 2015. I got this car from RIVERSIDE Sports and Prestige (BAD review left on Trustpilot). The car again presented 8 faults. RIVERSIDE ABSOLUTELY DID NOT CARE AT ALL. I had to get the car faults repaired at my own convenience.
One of the latest faults being the Boot latch was faulty. Boot wouldn’t open. I went to VW Inchcape Bolton to get quote for part and labour to replace it. Quote given and car booked in. I dropped the car off and three hours later I get a call saying they couldn’t replace the latch as they couldn’t open the boot. Well Duh! They said they will have to charge me extra labour to do it and when I mentioned that I am already paying you the time you quoted to replace the latch they got argumentative immediately and putting the blame on me. They told me they were just going to open the boot and replace the lock. But I said if the boot opened in the first place, I would never have visited you. The boot is stuck shut. How were you ever going to open it to replace the latch?!?
They become very argumentative and the same 10 years ago when I had the Polo. No change, Shameless and arrogant and ignorant people who should not be working here. Bad way to look after customers.
I mentioned that it’s common sense that I came to you to replace a latch because the boot is not opening. I wouldn’t have come otherwise! I had to say this when they assumed and told me, they were just opening the boot to replace it (this makes me laugh).
Secondly, he said to me that no one came out to see the boot latch problem physically when I argued on the extra half hour of labour, they decided to charge me. I said the member of the parts team came out, jumped inside the boot and investigated. A service that I like to see every time. I clarified that yes, someone came out so get your facts right!
Always! - they argue and defend themselves without studying the facts and blames customers. ALWAYS!

SHAMELESS – ARROGANCE – IGNORANCE

Circulate the below as a joke!
A funny story!
My car boot wouldn't open. It was stuck
I took it to VW, they couldn't open it
They said it need a new latch
They priced me up with part and labour
Today morning I dropped the car off
Few hours later they ring me and said we can't replace the latch!
I said why?
They said because we can't open the boot
What the!"
2022-11-16,5,Exceptional service &a very warm welcome given by Jack.
2022-11-16,5,"Service & M.O.T & Sat Nav update required, vehicle was left at the Dealership, returned around 5pm all of the work was completed. All Good 👍."
2022-11-14,5,"Volkswagen is by far the best I have been with! Very reliable , was fast with my car when it was in, was given a hire car so I didn’t have to go without! And my car was given a clean on the inside and out that was really good and nice! Thank you"
2022-11-16,5,"Having obtained quite a few offers for my car, I picked Inchcape.Some people said that you never receive what they offer but Inchcape were true to their word and I received every penny.There was none of the taking the car somewhere to be assessed,the assessor came to my home and told me he wouldn’t take the car till the money was in my bank. Altogether a stress free experience"
2022-11-12,5,"Michael Critchley was friendly, knowledgeable, patient, accommodating and always available from start to finish. Would definitely recommend him and buy from him again!!"
2022-11-12,5,Quick and easy hand over and pick up for my cars service
2022-11-11,5,The whole procedure from seeing the car testdrive to ordering and delivery. very caring understanding .no bull****.made to feel welcomed .
2022-11-15,5,Friendly effecient staff. Can recommend
2022-11-15,5,Seamless service from start to finish at Inchcape Manchester Bodyshop. The team led me through the booking in process and kept me up to date throughout the repair to my Tesla. I would highly recommend and will definitely use them again in the future. My car looks fantastic - very happy customer
2022-11-11,5,We were kept fully informed of progress and the car was returned in pristine condition ahead of schedule.
2022-11-14,5,"Deal went smooth, very cooperative and lovely salesman, Sam."
2022-11-09,5,"Had a problem with my car not recognising the smart key which needed immediate attention. I rang my local dealer for assistance, but regrettably their next available slot to even diagnose the issue was over a month away. I then rang Inchcape at Chester being the second nearest dealer to where I live. They booked my car in for the following day and rectified the issue within an hour whilst I waited. First class service in every way."
2022-10-28,1,"I cant explain how disappointed I am in the service provided.
After bringing in my vehicle to have a problem diagnosed...which wasnt! I had to book in for further investigation then had to wait 2-3 weeks to get back in.
After the exact same test being carried out plus a ""reset"" on the system I was told it was fixed.
I got in the car before leaving the garage and it instantly failed!
That was a Friday evening and I was told I would get booked in early the following week because of the inconvenience and would be contacted first thing Monday morning with a date to bring it in. That was 2 weeks ago but despite ringing and leaving email messages I had one holding email and still have had no date provided.
For a prestigious company I am absolutely disgusted at the complete disregard for customer service."
2022-11-11,5,Big thank you to Anna who made collecting my new Mini an absolute pleasure.
2022-11-14,5,Very professional service. Helpful and friendly staff.
2022-11-07,1,"Inchcape Volkswagen Chester.
Worst customer experience ever.
We bought an Astra GTC, DT66BKY, not knowing it had faults, took it back twice and were told nothing wrong with it. We were then told by Inchcape to take it to a Vauxhall dealer for a report at our expense which we did. Over £2000 of engine repairs needed, Inchcape then blanked us until we threatened legal action. Refund eventually given for the purchase price only, whole episode took 5 months.
Choose your dealer wisely, we didn’t."
2022-10-28,5,"The MOT area was spotless, the comfortable waiting area with refreshments was very welcome. The Mot pre check and the test itself went smoothly, and i was kept updated throughout. Zara made sure that i was 100% satisfied with some technical queries that i had that were not part of the MOT."
2022-11-04,5,"Had my car recently serviced at Nottingham Mercedes. The entire experience from booking, to taking the car in, to the service itself have all been very smooth. Peter Ward who serviced my car was excellent, good communication, good advice and I felt looked after as a customer."
2022-11-11,5,I’ve had a fantastic service at Mercedes Leicester thanks to Alvin Sarkis who helped me upgrade to a GLC300 easily. I’m super excited with my new car. I’ve always said it’s a Benz or nothing. I will be seeing you soon Alvin for the Wagon😂😂😂😂. Thank you very much Alvin and keep being the amazing sales person you are.
2022-11-04,1,"I have a service plan, but I was charged £69 for a brake fluid change. There was also a charge for an AC service which I did not take. No one explained these extra charges to me when I paid for my service plan and, quite frankly, the charges felt like a rip off to me. They had the car from 9.30 until 3pm when they phoned to explain what work had been done, we walked back to collect the car and were kept waiting for 1hour 15 before the car was returned uncleaned because that would have taken another 30 mins minimum. It was not a good experience and we wont be back."
2022-07-19,3,"I bought a Jaguar SVR from Inchcape Jaguar Derby.

The car is lovely and drives like a dream, so far. But the post-purchase support has been sadly lacking. I thought after my previous issues with this company, that I had finally met helpful representatives, but it seems that anything can and will be said to get the sale and then you join the others who moan about post-sale care.

I have seen your reply and it just isn't acceptable. Do you think it is acceptable that I need to ring or email numeoursa times and not get a response. If I could give this car back now and gert my money back, I would!"
2022-11-08,5,Year three service planned and executed to perfection. Special thanks to Sophie and Paul.
2022-11-05,5,The guy who served me was friendly and gave me constant updates about my car. I felt valued as a customer. Thank you!
2022-11-03,5,"We couldn't be more impressed with Azar from the moment he answered our call he fully understood what we were looking for what mattered to us.
Azar called us when he said he would he also sent a fab video of the car we was looking to purchase again particularly pointing out features that were important to us.
Any issues we had with the documents Azar got resolved quickly nothing was too much trouble. All the team seem to work together, there is a great atmosphere in the showroom. We would have no hesitation to recommend this dealership especially Azar to anyone looking to purchase a new vehicle."
2022-11-03,3,"People in showroom were very helpful. My car didn't get valeted after the recall upgrade was complete, which was a shame. I like the idea of the complimentary Car Health Check. Prices to rectify the issues were extortionate, B-Class owners don't have E-Class money"
2022-10-25,1,"Put the price up of my new car, lowered the part ex price of my own car and then sold it on for £4200 extra. Wont be back."
2022-11-02,5,Excellent customer service
2022-11-01,5,Delivery and collection service.....excellent.
2022-10-31,5,"A* Customer assistance and Service from Rebecca Toal at Inchcape Mercedes Coventry. After experiencing a cracked windscreen whilst driving home Rebecca was so helpful in ordering and organising the fitting of the replacement windscreen.
Mercedes Assist additionally provided a hire car during the duration of the work being carried out.
Rebecca updated me daily as to the process and organised the delivery of my car back home when the replacement windscreen was fitted.
Exemplary and very professional service from Rebecca."
2022-11-02,5,My 12 yr old mini S convertible had the exterior seals around the roof replaced. The overall result was very professionally completed in an afternoon and the car returned washed hoovered and with its new seals a stunning looking car can’t praise the quality of work and professionalism of the team
2022-11-03,5,Brought my car in for a service and it was brilliant customer service. Thank you!
2022-11-05,5,Great friendly and helpful team - Ashley is a great person to deal with. Made the whole experience of buying a new car very easy and trustworthy. The service was quick and reliable. I will return there. Highly recommend.
2022-10-31,5,"Thankyou macclesfield Audi for helping me upgrade me car! The process was so effortless and stress free! Adrian was excellent in getting me through the process from start to finish, I can't thank him enough!! The atmosphere is great, all the staff are lovely and you can have a coffee whilst you wait!"
2022-10-14,2,"In my health check I was told that my front tyres were 23% worn and my rear tyres 16% worn. I had had all four tyres replaced only the week before and when I questioned this with Terasa she said that this depends on my driving and braking behaviour. When I told her that I work from home and had been ill so had done less than 100 motorway miles on the new tyres. She responded saying that tyres can become worn more in the early days - which is clearly rubbish.
Also not happy that I was charged half hour labour each to change 2 wiper blades. I rang later that afternoon and left a message with a colleague for Terasa to call me back. I wanted to get my worn ignition button replaced. I never received a callback. Normally I accept that people can be busy and forget and/or not get the message but I recall exactly the same happening last year - a callback not being received - when I had my brake pads replaced. Last year I was quoted one price for the brake pads and labour before I booked the car in but was then charged more when I had the work done. The price was adjusted when I pointed it out but if I hadn’t had a quote before booking the car in I wouldn’t have known that I was being overcharged. This coupled with the fact that I was charged 2 hours labour for changing two brake pads and two wiper blades. Your assessment about my tyres and then the subsequent explanation makes me feel that something sinister is going on and if I didn’t want to preserve the jag service history on my car I certainly wouldn’t have used you again or in the future."
2022-10-01,1,"Usual Inchcape experience - poor
Booked my service in-person and they still managed to mess it up. I booked as ""waiting"" but they had it as a ""drop off"" so I was sitting around for ages - they didn't even start the service until 45 mins after I arrived, despite being there at the appointed time of 08:30.
The ""service manager"" had no idea about the scheduled tasks for the service or the costs as she ""hasn't the faintest idea about cars"" - yes, she actually said that. She walked off mid-conversation when I was complaining to her about the fact that the booking was made incorrectly.
There was confusion about the tasks to be completed as there were items in the previous service that were completed but shouldn't have been.
If I wanted the car washed, I would have had to wait another 20-30 minutes - after paying £400 for a ""minor"" service.
What a complete rip-off. MB service prices have gone through the roof - no wonder I couldn't get a booking with my local MB specialist for almost a month - who would use Inchcape if they didn't have to?"
2022-11-03,1,"My wife called in inchcape bolton to look at a voltswagen tiguan allspace ,she did not have an appointment but was prepared to wait ,
She went to the desk and asked if she could see one ,the reply was USED ! My wife said no new , just because my wife was not dressed up the woman just presumed she would not be after a new car , the sales people were busy but was not asked if she would like to wait and maybe have a cup of coffee ,so my wife asked if she could look at one on her own ,the person on the desk just said outside to the left I think there is one down there my wife left and came home , that a 33k loss because I won't be buying one now ."
2022-11-02,3,"Expensive service, falling a bit short on customer care. For example, having been told my car was ready, I was left waiting for 30 minutes whilst ""the paperwork was prepared"""
2022-10-31,5,"Marie was really helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. Couldn’t ask for a better experience."
2022-10-28,5,Haaris was my sales representative and he went above and beyond to make sure I was updated at every point. Excellent customer service so polite will be recommending to all my friends and family.
2022-10-28,2,"My car was six months old when the battery failed. I tried to book the car into get it checked out. The appointment was a month ahead but included a loan car. The car continued to fail to start and with a hospitalised elderly mother 200 miles away and the need to travel at short notice this was now a significant problem.
Inchcape appeared to have over commuted on non urgent recall work. The improved appointment was a week hence and the car had to be jump started to be taken in. The sales staff stepped up and provided a car (5 stars and thank you)
If a Dealership commits significant resources to non urgent recall work they need a plan to deal with urgent customer issues. I am regretting buying the service pack right now."
2022-10-31,5,I bought my second new car at Toyota Derby Inchcape. Yaris is an amazing car. Briefly I am over the moon. Very nice experience! Professional service. Strongly recommend.
2022-10-28,5,Very polite and professional. Very friendly too
2022-10-30,5,"I viewed the car on your website early on Sunday morning, called the dealership and was given an appointment by Elly for 1pm. We came and completed a test drive and agreed to prurchae the car. Collected the car at 2pm on Monday.
The process, from start to completion, was personal, professional and efficient. Elly made us feel at ease and relaxed, her excellent knowledge about the car, finance and Lexus approach was reassuring and was influential in our decision to go ahead and make the purchase.
Thank you Lexus Derby for your excellent customer service, a great car and cool staff 👍😎"
2022-10-28,5,"Arrived at Chelmsford BMW showroom to collect new EVi4. The purchase process had been longer than expected due to worldwide shortages of the technology chips and other parts so was not always as smooth as I would have expected but once Azar Khan took over the process improved immeasurably. He was in constant contact keeping us updated on progress and was excellent from start to finish. Even when he had nothing new to advise, he let us know so we were always confident he was working with us. He greeted us on collection day and took us through the new vehicle, showing us all the new features and assisted us with the new technology and logging into the vehicle's amazing management system. He was knowledgeable and patient and allowed us all the time we needed to understand everything before we left - excellent, and I would highly recommend Azar"
2022-10-31,1,"I brought my car in on Monday 31/10 for a service, telling the customer services advisor of a front passenger tyre deflation/issue. The car passed the service. I asked the chap on the phone to confirm the tyre was okay; and I was told it was. But alas, I knew it was not. However, on driving the car the following day, the tyre deflated and I was left with a cracked rim while driving. I now have to pay for this, when I knew there was an issue. I am truly disappointed about this service, as I informed the team there was an issue with the tyre - showed negligence and just dismissed me."
2022-10-28,5,"Customer comes first , I have to say every time I have visited I have been looked after very well .the customer experience is not to be faulted and even though my car was only in for a minor the level of service was superb very curtious and helpful. This is a fine example of how a dealership should be .for my experience I was anyway well done and thankyou"
2022-11-03,5,Very smooth and efficient process in dealing with inchape used cars. Thanks Joseph. Highly recommended for selling cars on cash with transparency throughout the process and spot payments!

All good"

2022-10-25,5,"Kept me informed at all times.
Excellent recall work at Inchcape.
Loan car was great too."
2022-10-29,5,"Perfect service can’t fault, I work away from home and it was really easy to complete documentation and get any questions answered"
2022-11-01,1,"My car was booked in at BMW Reading for a recall letter I received through the post.I dropped my car off to the only receptionist at the desk.About 5 minutes later I was on my way home when I received a call saying that system went down 15 minutes ago and my car would have to be rebooked in.
I returned to reception to the same lady I dealt with 10 minutes previously who then asked if she could help me!! I explained about the phone call and she knew nothing about it. I asked had she been told about the fault in the diagnostic system and she said she did not....You would think that reception would be the FIRST people informed so that they could tell customers who were leaving their car with them...but that did not happen!!
I did not get an offer of a courtesy car,no apology,no compensation for my time,petrol etc...I would say I'm disappointed in taking a day's annual to take my car to Reading BMW but unfortunately it is not the first time this company has forced me to write a terrible review."
2022-10-31,5,"The service we received from the sales team at VW Exeter was superb. Aron was extremely efficient, managed to sort out our purchase very quickly and had everything sorted in a short space of time, ably assisted by Will Kenny, his salesman. We can only say a big ‘thank you’ to them and much appreciated such a friendly but very professional experience."
2022-10-31,5,"Inchcape Land Rover Guildford, thank you once again for a wonderful experience with the purchase of our lovely new Defender. Thank you to Sales Manager Graham Champion who instinctively knows his customers and offers the perfect car. Special mention for our superb Sales Lady Annabel Mould, truly professional at all times with friendly, knowledgeable advice. The whole transaction was seamless and an enjoyable experience with excellent customer service from all the team. Highly recommended, thank you."
2022-10-26,1,"Just had my Land Rover (cam belt etc)serviced and mot but on the VHC check I’m told that it urgently requires both lower control arms, a prop shaft centre bearing, one tyre which is 91% worn and a number plate bulb at a cost of over £3000 pounds on top of the £1240 service.
I questioned this as I had done very little mileage since last year, and had just returned from Paris without any issues, so after the service the vehicle has its MOT which it passed with only 1 advisory the number plate bulb.
It seems to me that monthly targets needed to be met and creative repairs were required.
I almost sanctioned the work as it was apparently urgent, I have always had it serviced by a main dealership but after this experience it will be the last.
I’m still waiting for a manager to phone me for a explanation on the VHC verses the MOT"
2022-10-28,5,"It took half the year to obtain my new Lexus. The staff stayed in touch and made the experience at handover seamless and pleasant, taking as much time as necessary run through the hi tech on board and safety features. Even a video for reminders. Good Stuff.Good Staff."
2022-10-28,5,New car purchase. Essy to deal with. Pleased with car.
2022-10-25,3,"Overall reasonable. Had to wait ages at reception to hand car over for an appointment as receptionist was busy with a customer. Meanwhile people would walk up and disturb her to avoid the queue. Service advisor was less than interested and didn’t seem to give any consideration to the fact I wanted to speak about other cars I own. Usually a much more personal service at Tetbury, it is by no means the nearest dealer but I was happy to travel the distance to secure good customer service. Sensing after this visit I will need to review this."
2022-10-28,3,"Service of the vehicle was fine as was the fitting g of the Dashcam.
I didn’t get a call when my car was ready and the valet was poor with the inside of the windscreen being streaky and inside the boot was not touched at all."
2022-10-17,5,"On all occasions when I visited Inchcape at Derby, I was received in a friendly and professional manner, and in particular Craig who dealt with the sale of my F-Type Jaguar."
2022-10-19,5,Very accommodating and helpful
2022-10-24,5,A pleasant experience due to the pleasant and efficient staff.
2022-10-22,5,"I recently purchased new Mercedes from Oxford, what a fantastic dealership! Stuart was more than willing to help and provided an exceptional customer service, he was very patient in answering all my questions. My special thanks to him, who made my car buying experience an absolute joy.. highly recommended Thank you!"
2022-10-18,5,Exceptional customer service all matters dealt with efficiently
2022-10-26,5,I’m very happy for my recent purchase and I would recommend inchcape Chelmsford BMW. Staff are very friendly thanks Jack Lewis being such a very good sales man he is very helpful.
2022-10-24,1,"Having dropped my car in for a service at 8am it had got to 5:35pm with the garage closing at 6 and I hadn’t received the promised call to say my car was ready for collection. I rang Audi to be told they were just about to call me, hmmm what a coincidence. And then for the 2nd time in 12 months I collect my car having been told it would be washed and it wasn’t washed, again! In fact I had to remove the seat protector and paper from the footwell myself so I’m now cleaning up after the technicians. I complained again, only to be told the valeting team had gone home. Appalling service yet again!"
2022-10-26,5,"Recommend this dealership ,had the car serviced here.
Good experience,will use again in the future"

Well done John in parts department!"
2022-10-27,5,I have dealt with Inchcape Mercedes-Benz Derby for many years and always find them a pleasure to deal with. They show a level of efficiency that is rare these days. I only wish others would follow their example.
2022-10-25,5,We have been customers here since 2008 and always received good service.
2022-10-19,1,"I always recieve a terrible service at Swindon Audi. Never get called back, no communication on when my cars ready, I always have to chase the dealership and ask if it’s done. Asked the woman I dealt with when I dropped my car off how many services I had left on my plan, she said she can see on the computer I’ve used one so I will only have one left as they only ever sell them as 2 year plans but I have found out my original invoice and I bought a 3 year plan so I actually have 2 left, so basically got lied to."
2022-10-25,5,"The staff were very courteous and polite throughout.
The work on my car was carried out to a very high standard. I was kept fully infomed. I am delighted with the treatment I received.
I would recommend Warrington Mercedes very highly."
2022-10-19,1,"Left car to fix adblue issue and get a service with a pick up at 5pm. Turned up to find service done but bothered with adblue issue, wanted to keep car for 2 more days. I had to tell them the fault code and that it was probably a software update. Took another day for them to confirm a software update and fix issue. Then had the cheek to charge me £100 for the pleasure of fixing a known issue. Terrible customer service"
2022-10-20,5,"We were extremely pleased with the professional level of service that we received from Ryan, at our local Lexus dealer.
The entire buying experience from start to finish was excellent and we would highly recommend Lexus Nottingham to anyone.
Keep up the good work.

2022-10-24,1,"NEVER USE THIS COMPANY THEY WILL COMPLETELY RIP YOU OFF!
I bought a van from this company last October, but the way I was sold to was classic bad sales.. my only fault is I bought it with my heart and not my head and possibly being a woman.
I called them for a quote on a van which was brand new. At the time I didn’t think I could afford it so didn’t go for it . A few weeks later the sales man called me with the colour I really wanted. Been blinded by this the sales man who did his work on me .
What he did was add all the add ons you can pay for separately but failed to tell me that . So he added on an extended 18month warranty , 3services 2 mots, roadside breakdown recovery protection care for inside and out side the van NOT ONCE DID HE SAY THIS WAS ADD ONS ,which you didn’t have to have WHAT HE DID WAS SAY IT WAS YOU GET THIS INCLUDED!
I only found the truth about this a few days ago when I called about a problem I had with the van and I’m disgusted at what he did !
WARRANTY A WASTE OF MONEY.
So a light came on , I called the service team who told the DPF was faulty.
No one could tell me if this was included in the warranty, what they said was I had to pay £156 for a diagnostic check then it would go through to the warranty team who would tell you if it was a warranty issue or not ! This would be fare enough if it was something I had done like smash a light etc . But no this is a fault with the van.
What is the point of a warranty you never even asked for if you have to pay for a repair upfront.COWBOYS .
I went to a what I thought was a good VW dealer but ended up worse off .Trafford park Manchester. To top it all of, the new van he quoted me actually worked out £500 less than the van he sold me which was 4 years old with 37,000 miles on the clock ABSOLUTELY RIPPED ME OFF
Update 28/10/22 after taking the van to another reputable garage I found out it was not the DPF which was faulty which the service guy had told me when I told him what light was on the dash board but the nox sensor. I called in Inchape back and was told the same thing I’d have to pay £156 to do the diagnostic!! So the next day I called again and told them I would be taking legal action .. the van is now booked in on Tuesday so I will update after Tuesday
Just had a reply on here asking me to send email to them directly.. I sent 2 emails last week to them but no reply but amazingly they can reply to this comment!!!"
2022-10-21,5,Picked up a new car. Service from Richard was excellent throughout. Happy to recommend.
2022-10-21,5,Helpful throughout the process of buying a vehicle. Very kind and made the process very easy and comfortable to complete
2022-10-08,5,Quick professional and friendly experience
2022-10-19,4,"Friendly and helpful staff, car was serviced in the expected time frame. Sadly I was offered the car to be cleaned and when informed it was ready for collection was also confirmed the car had been cleaned. It was only after I’d paid for the service and received my keys I’d found the car hadn’t been cleaned and was then thinking what else hasn’t been carried out.
I’m sure BMW would have higher expectations from their staff and if they say they’re going to do something then it’s expected that it’s done.
Thank you."

Attention Duncan Andrew Tait
Sir ,
The above vehicle was placed with Inchcape service centre Guildford Friday 7 Oct to investigate a problem with the suspension and to replace the bonnet struts .
I was subsequently advise on the following Monday of what was required and the total cost to resolve the suspension problem and replace the bonnet struts ,which I verbally authorised .

As I had no immediate need for the vehicle I advised Inchcape that providing the work could be completed by Wednesday afternoon that would be fine .

Aside from asking several times for a breakdown of the total cost to be emailed to me nothing was forthcoming .Around lunch time on the wed I call the service centre and after going through the usual press this number for that dept etc I was then faced with no reply from the service department even after 7 minutes .
In desperation I called the same main phone number again but this time pressed the required digit to reach the sales dept, assuming they would answer ,which they quickly did and I then ask them to find me someone from the service Dept .
Success and as always when you can reach one of this team they are most polite and helpful and as agreed John later called me back to confirm the vehicle would indeed be ready later that day Arriving to collect the vehicle and following a most agreeable chat with John I was initially delighted when I went to take the car away to find it cleaned ,however joy turned to despair when I opened the car door and found the dashcam not only disconnected but all the wiring hanging down .As you may imagine I was displeased and had to go back into to the centre and after showing John the issue ( who was most apologetic) he called out another person to make good the wiring issue (he too was apologetic) .I subsequently found that for some reason the radio setting had been changed and the trip meters zeroed plus finding a scrap of paper marked 140 stuffed down the front of the dash ( I assume this to be the job number for the guys in the workshop)
My point is that to use a main dealer for any work is always going to be top dollar which I can live with and having a very good front of house service team (likeJohn ) is a given but the clear lack of attention to detail when actually returning the vehicle to the customer is not acceptable

Very polite, informative staff.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2022-10-21,1,"Car went in for recall, oil service and vehicle check as required by in car notifications. I had a credit note from a previous service where I had been overcharged £95. However, once again, I was presented with bill far in excess of my expectations and only after complaining did the invoice get reduced by £140. The recall removed my Apple car play functionality which was explained that it has taken it back to factory settings. Totally unacceptable and I have no trust left from this dealership that constantly lie and try to overcharge me. This time I am left with a car less functional than before and no care or concern for my satisfaction."
2022-09-29,1,"APPALLING Service. They do not care!! I booked my car in for a service and recall a month ahead, along with a loan car for the day. I arrived on time and was told by the Manager of the service department that he would sort my loan ca. I never saw him again. For the next half hour I stood and waited and a number of staff asked if they could help and I explained. They then went off to find him and never came back. Eventually I said that I was leaving and one of the team investigated, said he could not find the manager or a loan car and apologised. he assured me that the manager would call me, but almost 4 weeks later - nothing!!! So my car is not serviced and no recall fix!!"
2022-10-18,4,"Only negative was every setting that could be changed, had been. While I expected electronic settings to be reset with a software update, I did not expect the manual seats, steering wheel etc to be moved. Not a problem for most people but a suffer from a bad back and it takes me ages to get the settings just right. The recall performed would not have required a test drive after so the moving of seats etc was completely unnecessary."
2022-10-14,5,"I went to Lexus service for an MOt and Hybrid check. The young gentleman who served me was excellent. He was so polite and patiently explained everything. Nothing was too much trouble.

The lady in reception kindly offered me a meeting room to work whilst my car was having an MOT and Hybrid Check. She kept checking I was ok and whether I needed any refreshments throughout my time in the room which was so thoughtful.

I would highly recommend Lexus to friend and family. Your staff and service is absolutely the best. Thank you"
2022-10-21,1,"I bought a car in March from the Swindon branch the sales service was fine until the car had a problem, we were told to get it fixed and send in the bill and they would refund us , this is when the customer service fails dismally nobody contacts you or replies to your emails and it is down to you to keep chasing them up. We are still waiting for 2 other refunds for problems we have had with the car which again we were told to get it fixed and send them the bill, the bills are from 29/07/22 and 16/09/22, both of these were authorised by the manager Craig and he emailed Greg and Rachel to process the refunds despite several emails nobody has got back to me and we have not received our refunds. I am appalled by the service we have received and intend to contact the FCA next week"

2022-10-18,5,"Spoke to Mike in the service team, who was extremely helpful and kept me updated whilst my car was repaired. Very happy."
2022-10-20,3,"Visit for an A0 service. Initially I tried asking for details of what included in the service in the branch, however was informed that information was only available via the booking line. Called the booking line, placed on hold for almost 30 mins only to be told the branch were the only ones who could provide this information.

Went back to the dealership where I finally managed to obtain the information but only after having to negotiate the receptionist.

Car was serviced including an oil change. 2 days later while driving the oil warning light applied ""engine oil overfill"". This happened in every journey.

Called the dealership and was told the service manager would call me back.. it didn't happen. Called the next day and again was told I'd get a call back.. didn't happen. So on the third day I drove out of my way to ask in person.

Was now approached by a female member if staff from the service team.

""It's gone 5pm so there's nothing we can do right now""

""I understand that, I called in as no one had called me despite saying they would""

""OK, well I'm sorry that didn't happen, when can you bring it in?""

""Tomorrow""

Now although there was an apology for the non phone calls, it doesn't excuse the fact that the service wasn't carried correctly and it could/'ve damaged the engine.

Not great service from a marque you expect to provide a high quality service."
2022-10-20,5,"Just bought my first Epace jaguar from Emily. Excellent service from start to finish. I had a test drive, questions answered by Emily.

A super lady who not only is very knowledgeable has passion and cares for the customer. Thanks so much"

we were instantly surprised by the non-pushy manner of the sales reps we had Andre reis helping us who has only just started the job, he talked us through the process very politely and explained everything thoroughly. He was overlooked by Mathew pope who helped him out when he got stuck on a few things (only to be expected for someone learning the job)
overall, a very good service from all round car was gleaming when I picked it up and I couldn't be happier

Surely you can just book the car in with whoever is free as it's a pre-booked appointment. No chairs at the desk for checking in (not an issue for me at all but I expect difficult for many).
I always find the whole process intimidating but on this occasion very impersonal too particularly on collection, no eye contact, no feedback and didn't feel able to ask for it so I assuming all is ok with my car?"

2022-10-12,5,"Inchcape Retail UK (Mercedes North Wales) recalled my 10 year old car for an airbag replacement. The car was collected from and returned to my home. Shortly after receiving the car, the inspecting mechanic sent me a video of the car on a lift and walked through everything underneath pointing out what was what. He identified those components showing signs of wear including tyres. He then identified two issues that needed repair, one of which was corrosion to a subframe. This repair could cost £1800 but the dealership contacted Mercedes, on my behalf, and they agreed the corrosion was premature and they would pay for it. How good was that? Very impressed with the whole experience and the level of service provided by Mercedes North Wales."

2022-10-08,1,Booked a same day wait in car service appointment at 9am Saturday the 8th October. I asked prior to booking the appointment how long will it take and again was informed 1 hour. It has taken 1 hour in the past. The colleague also told me the dealership closes at 12.30pm on Saturday so only morning appointments to wait in were available. After 2 hours 30mins I asked at reception why is it taking so long. They then said we told you it could take until 12.30pm. Not once was I told this as if I was I would of made other arrangements. I would not of booked a wait in appointment if I had to wait 3hours 30mins. This was a major inconvenience and I had to cancel my plans during the day. The receptionist then said I’ll chase this for you and the car was then done within 5 minutes. If that was the case What was I waiting for?

2022-09-30,5,"I cannot write highly enough of my experience with your team in Reading - the buying and exchanging of my Cooper S was the definition of service excellence from start to finish.

Simon Allan was truly amazing in each interaction and achieved the turnaround from appointment booking to happy customer sale within 3 days - at month and quarter end which is no mean feat based on how busy the whole team were. His in-depth knowledge of all things Mini was obvious from the start of our conversations, his passion for the brand and commitment to customer service was unquestionable.

He did everything to ensure the rapid completion of my purchase and that my Mini experience was hugely positive - from coffees (provided by the lovely Julie), feature walk throughs, test drive help and calls to check all was progressing from all sides. He also engaged with James, business manager to facilitate the speed of service and the whole team at Reading seemed to help make this happen for me because of him.

I cannot tell you how many people I have already told about this wonderful service and will continue to do so until I make my next purchase from Mini!

Truly outstanding, above, beyond and so appreciated, thank you so so much."

2022-10-07,1,"Appalling service received from JLR Sealand Road, Chester.

I contacted them for assistance on 26th September, reporting a leak from the passenger side windscreen. I was transferred to the service department who booked my car in for 28th September at 10:15. I dropped my car off at the dealership at the given time and was promised a call as soon as the problem was identified, I was advised at drop off that my car may not be ready to collect until the following day, which I said was not an issue at that time.

I did not receive a call until 17:56 on 28th September, when I was advised that the issue had been located and would need to be fixed off site as they don’t deal with such issues on site. I was advised that they would have to order in a new windscreen in case the old one broke whilst being removed and in light of the fact that it was late, it wouldn’t be ordered until the following day, and by the time it had been received, I would be looking at not getting my car back until early the following week. At this point I asked the gentleman (Mike) if he could assure me that the vehicle was being kept under cover as I didn’t want the interior of my car ruined by the rain leaking in. He assured me that this was the case!

The next contact I received was on 30th September to update me that the screen had been ordered.

I heard nothing else until 5th October at 16:15, which was the call I was expecting to say my car was fixed and ready to collect. However I was informed that my car was still not fixed and they would need to check that the part had come in and ring me back. At this point, I asked for further assurances that my car was under cover and I was advised that it was. I did not receive a call back until 14:32 on 6th October from another of the advisors, telling me that it was likely to be 3 weeks before they received the windscreen in stock. She advised me to collect the car and take it direct to National Windscreens myself!! I agreed do this and arrived at the dealership at approximately 12:30 today.

Firstly, they were unable to locate the whereabouts of my car. When they did eventually find it and brought it to the collection area, it was blatantly obvious it had been kept outside, in the torrential rain, for over a week! Through the window, I could see them trying to mop up the water inside my car, so I went over to them to see the damage for myself. It was soaking wet inside. The passenger seat, driver seat, roof by the leak, carpets, all drenched. Had they have let me have the car back earlier I could have at least kept it garaged and dry until it could be fixed. So not only have I been without my car for nearly 10 days, they have succeeded in wrecking my interior, which was immaculate beforehand. And it is still not fixed.

I drove out of the dealership, after speaking with the Manager, Jamie Menzies, who offered me no support whatsoever, in the pouring rain, with water pouring over me whilst driving. I asked Mr Menzies why I was told it was kept undercover whist standing there and he said they don’t have the room to do that. So I asked why it wasn’t covered over to stop the water getting in, and he said that they don’t have the means to do that.

I asked him for details of the complaints procedure and he said I would have to email him and gave me his email address. It was clear he did not care about how it had made me feel, the inconvenience they had caused me and clearly just wanted me to get in my car and go.

The dealer was all very nice when I was buying the car, but the after sales service at that particular dealership is not up to standard. I told the manager that I had decided to go to them to have the work done as I believed them to be the experts.

I am now going to get my car fixed by National Windscreens myself!"

2022-09-28,1,"Contact centre did not give correct information about how long I would have to wait as they said it would be 60mins but it’s actually two hours and I nearly missed my next appointment. Find it quite disgusting that you want to charge £20 for collection and delivery when I live a mile away!! Taxis to and from the dealership would be less than that! The money it costs to buy and maintain an Audi and you want to charge that. Going forward I will not be using the dealership and using a different garage.
As soon as I can I will be selling my Audi and going back to Toyota where I was looked after properly"

2022-09-26,1,"After my horrid experience from Inchcape VW West London a couple of years ago when they left me high and dry with a broken down 60k Touareg which broke down on the delivery day and they refused to give me money back for 9 months, no help no apologies, no compensation, no car no nothing, After a couple of good cars from other dealers I went to place my order in Guildford for a 2023 Lexus RX500. Then I realised Lexus Guildford is Inchcape, I went straight to Currie Motors Twickenham. Once bitten.

UPDATE ... Inchcape made contact with me after reading my honest review and ask me to provide the registration and all details of the nightmare and loss of monies, which i did, they came back to me and said they don't own VW West London anymore so the matter is closed but as a good will gesture they will give me 15% of accessories such as mud flaps etc. basically £30.00. unbelievable who are these people! once again Inchcape have wasted more of my time with utter nonsense and incompetence. my advice is don't ever buy a new car from Inchcape as once they have your money they are not interested in you or your car they are only interested in your money, do your research and find a smaller reputable car business who actually care and will support you when and if problems arise, I've worked it out, i actually lost about £8000.00 and 9 months of stress for something which wasn't my fault, i was completely innocent and Inchcape destroyed any new car enjoyment and put me through months of hell. once bitten!"

2022-10-05,4,"Inchcape Norwich Parts

I popped into your parts department today for a new remote case for a 2019 Discovery Sport disappointed that it had only lasted 3 years 7 months.
The young lady on the parts desk, I think her name was Louise is an asset to your company. Not only sourced the case quickly but when asked how to take it apart, got somebody to do it while I waited.
This made up for the other let down a couple of weeks ago when my car broke down and was told you couldn’t help me as it would take 4-6 weeks to look at it.
I realise it’s a horrible time for the motor industry but people like Louise need to be recognised as they are the ones who keep customers loyal to the brand."
2022-09-28,1,"During a service I received a call telling me they think there might be an oil leak and they wanted £180 to investigate plus the auxiliary belt had snapped and a roller needs replacing, the belt was fine when I arrived!. I was not happy with this so I took it to another garage I use and fully trust to check over for me, they told me no oil leak and couldn't understand what made them think there was an oil leak in the first place, the rollers were all in line and didn't need replacing so they just replaced the belt for £105. if I would have the Audi garage carry on with the works it would have cost me around £450 on top of the £365 for the service. Although they told me it might have an oil leak I don't understand why they would still carry out the oil change. They topped up the adblue which they spilt all down the side of my car and all over the wheels and didn't even bother to clean. I don't think I will be using Audi again as this kind of thing happened to me about 4 years ago."

The car was unlocked so we could have a look around, then our details were taken down to arrange a call back, which was really appreciated. We spoke to Rhiannon about an hour later to discuss the car, part exchange and finance package. We then arranged a test drive the following day, after which we completed on the car. The whole process was very relaxed and we were kept thoroughly informed throughout. We really appreciated the Finance being rushed through right at the end of the day so that we could pick the car up the following day."

Inchape agreed and carried out another full check of my car. Found nothing, EPC light came back on so took my car back. They said it might be a new turbo. They checked the car and suggested a new actuator. They said they tried to put one on but couldn't because they said the arm was stuck fast therefore it would be a new turbo. Doing me a favour they quoted approx £1300. I took my golf to my local repair shop who has just fixed a new actuator on and demonstrated how freely the turbo works. It cost me £328 in total. My Golf 1.4 this was bought new from VW Stockport 5yrs ago and has had every service carried by them it's done approx 27k miles. I will never trust that dealership again."

There was no hard sell, there was time given for us to think, walk around the showroom and forecourt, have a coffee, think again and we made the decision to buy a car. Superb level of customer service given, Richard kept in touch throughout the buying process to ensure that the vehicle was ready for collection on the day/time that we all agreed."

2022-09-23,3,"I wasn't pleased that the number of days to service inspection indicator was reset to 730 days (2 years) despite this only being a software upgrade and battery replacement visit - no service was carried out (not required until February) and the indicator did not need to be reset. I called you about this and was given a reasonable explanation as to why this happened. However it is still a bit annoying.

I have noticed that there is a hint of a ding in the bonnet as if someone has used a hand to push it shut. The manual quite clearly states that the bonnet should be dropped into place from a height of about 20cm which is what I ALWAYS do. Obviously there is no proof that the ding occurred whilst the car was at Inchcape, but I just thought I would mention it as I am very disappointed.

I have noted that the car's infotainment system says the software level is version 2.3 despite the upgrade that you carried out being to version 2.4 . I understand that if the infotainment system also says software 0912 (which it does) then the car does actually have 2.4 installed. This is somewhat confusing and could have been explained to me when I picked the car up. Instead I had to search the internet to be reassured that all was ok - at least I think it is.

Otherwise everything went reasonably smoothly."
2022-09-13,3,"Although my vehicle was repaired in the end and I received a good will gesture. The experience was beyond belief, the mistakes and four morning appointments with my vehicle being off the road for four mornings to get to a resolution was actually quite unacceptable and unprofessional, not something I would have expected from a non Mercedes dealership never mind an Official Mercedes Dealership.

2022-09-22,5,"Efficient and friendly service, from being greeted at the entrance through to collecting the car and making payment after the service work had been completed. The waiting-in-store option whilst waiting for the car to be serviced was welcome; my only suggestion would be to offer this for Saturday servicing as it would offer more flexibility around work schedules to be able to service the car at weekends. Another suggestion to improve the customer service at the end is to review the technician's advisory report with the customer; I was told verbally there were no issues to report yet on subsequent review of the report noted an advisory on a tyre wear condition. Otherwise, I was generally happy with the customer service levels, the time taken to service the car and the customer facilities in-store (seating area, refreshments, bathrooms etc)."

RE- INCHCAPE TOYOTA WARRINGTON.......


Hello,

This email is in response to your reply to my trustpilot review a few days ago.


I have been in the fortunate position to purchase a new car every 2 or 3 years for the last 20 years or so. The experience and service I received from your garage and it's staff was so unacceptable it is hard to put into words, buying and picking up a new car is and should be a special day that was totally robbed from us by your staff.


When I purchased the car in April it was 5 star treatment and quality from Bentleys and Larisa, but now since Inchcape got involved it has been terrible from start to finish.


I will list the calamitous events as they happened;


Wed 7th Sept...spent over two hours trying to complete standard paperwork and pay remaining deposit, several errors made during this meeting that I had to highlight to your staff. The staff just constantly blamed new systems and staff shortages.Arranged to pick up new car two days later on the 9th. Car not ready on the 9th at the arranged time...Safeguard protection pack had not been applied and car had not even been cleaned to a good standard for a handover. Was asked to come back on the 10th and the car would be ready then. For this delay I was offered a full tank of fuel and a part discount on my service pack and asked to still give a good review on the Toyota survey. Picked the car up on the 10th, very little in the way of a tour round my new car as he said he was run off his feet due to staffing issues, and I was promised my refund within a few days........ and I would receive a call to check how we were getting on with the car NO CALL!!! 16 days later and only after I had complained on the survey and Trustpilot did I receive my refund

This has been a shockingly poor display by your garage and staff who take no ownership of any problems and just look for the easy way out to blame someone or something else.

This has totally tarnished my perception of Inchcape Motors and would take something special for that to change.


I wrote the damming reviews in the hope that the service gets better and others don't suffer the same disappointment we have.

I may still compose more reviews on social media sites so other customers know what to expect. 


Yours a very angry and disappointed customer.

My experience with Zoe has been nothing less than amazing and I highly recommend her and Cheshire Oaks Mercedes to everyone!"
2022-09-16,5,"Service for my Golf GTi. Looked after by Jodie who did a brilliant job as did everyone else I interacted with that day. It is clear that the Exeter branch really does value its customers. I have owned BMWs and Audis and I no longer own them due to the arrogance of the dealers. Even the Exeter receptionist asked if there was anything he could do for me when he spotted I was on my own for a while.

Customers don't want much just to be treated like they mater and I was. The car was sorted quickly and my expectations were managed. Very happy and will buy again from Exeter."

2022-09-11,1,"Inchcape Oxford must be the worst Mercedes dealership in the country. Their aftersales service department is 100% a joke.

Bought a GLC 250 from Mercedes Oxford in Mid-May. My experience with Mercedes Oxford has been terrible and if possible I would give a ZERO STAR.

1. On the day of test drive Mercedes Oxford suggested that I buy a Gardx protection package to protect the appearance (paint, seats, etc), which cost ~ £750. Shorter after the car was delivered to me I found three problems: (1) there is a large stain (> 20 mm diameter) on the running board which looked like some kind of chemical bleaching on the painting of the running board. This occurred after they did the Gardx service because on the day when I bought the car there was no stain at all (I have taken photos as evidence). (2) There is an issue with the radio that it often turns itself on automatically and this happens randomly. (3) Sometimes when I am at uphill or downhill or doing parking maneuver there is a weird noise when I use the brake. (4) Gardx said they will provide an after-service package to me but I never received.

Contacted Mercedes Oxford at the end of May (2 weeks after I received the car) to report the issues but sadly they simply ignored me and never replied my query.

2. Later I found another big problem with the car. The chrome trim around the two front windows start to degrade rapidly (see the photos). There appeared to be quite a lot of oxidized/bleached dot on the surface and this can not be removed by cleaning. I thought this was because of car wash or rain but it only occurs near the front windows. The chrome trim near the rear window and on the top rail are good. In the meantime, the running board paint is showing more worse degradation.

3. The latest problem I found is that about 3 weeks ago, one of the reversing light stopped working and I keep getting a warning message ""reversing light"" on the dashboard.

I then contacted Mercedes Oxford to report all the above issues. Over the last few weeks I called them so many times but only got a reply that their service team will contact me for the repair. I was promised that ""the service team will contact you by the end of today"", which they have never done. Like before, they simply ignored/dodged my problems. I was told that they would call me for at least 6 times which never happened at all.

Avoid this dealership. If there is any problem with the car aftersales do not expect them to fix the issue."

2022-09-23,5,"Excellent staff, great price, amazing service, higly recommended"
2022-08-19,1,"Visited the dealership firstly in Mid August to get my fuel cap fixed as it was wasn’t operating as it should, and also my SOS. Dropped my car off at the dealership and within 2 hours I’d received a phone call saying my car was ready to collect, has to wait for fuel cap part to come, but nothing was done about my SOS due to no internet connection within the building.
Returned to the dealership to get my car, and I could see that my fuel cap cover had been completely broken off and just placed in my passenger seat off my car and the black attachment under the cap cover was not over the fuel tank, went into the lady that dealt with me and told her, and her first reply was are you sure that wasn’t like that already. Obviously stating the obvious to her I took her outside to show her the issue, and she said there’s nothing much we can do as everyone has gone home, I refused to drive the car as it was dangerous and illegal to do so. She went to get her manage so see what he could do. Eventually they both came up with the great idea off putting BLUE TAC to keep the cover closed over, this wasn’t the best idea as blue tac doesn’t stick for long periods off time especially when it’s got weather to contend with and I had to buy tape to keep the fuel cap closed.
I then returned around mid September to get my fuel filler cap sorted as I was meant to get a phone call when it arrived but never did. When I picked up the vehicle when it was finished the fuel filler cap had been fixed and so had the SOS, but upon looking at the fuel cap when I got home, I realised it was a different shade off blue to my car colour. Have sent 2 emails asking what can you do, but head nothing back.
Been a very very poor service from the service team, not the best considering they say “the best or nothing”."
2022-09-22,5,"The receptionist was on that always greets me with a smile and warmthness to her. I told her the reason why I was there and she got in touch with Charlotte Jones. It’s nice to sing praises for someone and Charlotte and the team well deserve it. There is so much negativity in the world and people don’t seem to appreciate the small things. For Charlotte and the team that what they do, they do small things that make the difference. Charlotte always goes above and beyond and I can never say “Thank You” enough. So “Thank You” Charlotte and the team for looking after me."

When I purchased it the last MOT had an advisory on rear shock absorbers they agreed to change these then went back on their word saying they had been checked and they weren’t leaking. I’ve just had my first MOT and am disgusted to find out that not only are these completely shot but that I’ve been driving around for 9 months with the tyres on the wrong way, this is very dangerous and I could have had a serious accident at any point! This is an MOT failure! So they sold me an unroadworthy car which was unsafe. I’ve now got a huge bill. After contacting the dealership they don’t give two hoots! No responsibility then at all and the guy I spoke to today ‘Ben’ was absolutely arrogant, rude and disrespectful! Everyone stay well away as I’d hate to see someone else spend their well earned money on something unsafe! Also when serviced the oil filter looked like it had never been changed!

2022-09-12,2,"Pretty poor from start to finish.
Firstly the quoted service was incorrect and then 3 days prior I was told that not all items were covered and a larger service was recommended.
Then the software was not updated nor checked on the service despite this being or should be a given. Told that software check needs ramp space???? And cost could new a few hours labour (previously the garage couldn’t even do a software update which I did myself using in car sim). Then part of the service was to top up the DEF, after collecting the car the DEF monitor gave 6356 miles until empty. It was at 4023 before it went in so only a couple of litres added when it’s an 18ltr tank and should read closer to 10,000 miles or more.
I queried this and was told they need to connect it to their machine to see what the level was and if it meets the recommend level (surely full is the only recommended level)!
Wouldn’t recommend. Better to find an independent specialist, since changing from Marshall’s the service inc customer service has fallen off a cliff.

Updated.
Over a week since inchcape replied asking me to contact them direct which I did. Still heard nothing from them. Don’t see why I should be chasing them, obviously customer care team get the same training"

2022-09-20,2,"Sales was good, bought vehicle in efficient and friendly manner. Some of the work expected to be completed on the vehicle was not carried out. One month after purchase the vehicle has gone into restricted power mode and after 10+ telephone calls with LandRover assist, inchcape assist and the dealer in Kings Lynn the vehicle was recovered to the dealer. No courtesy car available as everyone thought someone else should have arranged. Finally found out the issue is intercooler pipe and another part which will be repaired under warranty but during investigation a “major advisory” of oil leak on bell housing has been identified. I have been told nothing will be done with that issue as I need to book it in separately, so no idea if I can drive my car, or who to talk to. Great sales, diabolical aftercare, shameful."

Sales department, less impressive. I was contacted to see if I wanted to discuss a buying new, used car which I agreed to. I stayed from the outset I was pretty easy going with regards to the car I’d go into, as long as it wasn’t a higher cost per month. Preferably cheaper. Salesperson didn’t listen and not only did he keep showing cars that would be £20-£50 more per month, he told me that even with the equity (£1.000) in mine I’d have to put a minimum of £500 down on top to get theses prices. Multiple independent valuations show I would have between £2,000 - £2,600 equity in my car.

The vehicle was also not cleaned inside or out after the service as agreed by the dealership.

Also no availability to pay by american express."
2022-09-13,5,"Stock list was very much up to date, visited on the Friday and reserved and picked the car up Tuesday. No hard sell, very relaxed conversation. Offered the usual asset protection, paint protection and bodywork insurance but again no hard sell.

2022-09-12,2,"I always find the staff at Mercedes Benz Coventry very unfriendly and not very welcoming especially the lady that checked me in at the service desk when I brought my car in for a service.

For a prestigious brand like that you would think & expect that customer service and satisfaction would be at the forefront of everything they do."
2022-09-13,5,Staff pleasant and nice but when we picked up the car there was oily feet marks on the door and inside the car.and mentioned it to the service manager

Cannot recommend BMW Chelmsford enough, will 100% be returning in the future!"
2022-09-03,5,We purchased a used approved 2019 Lexus RX450H and traded in our 2015 model. Inchcape Lexus provided a friendly and highly professional service in relation to all facets of the transaction. The vehicle had been immaculately prepared and we are delighted with it. Inchcape Lexus Leicester is a very good example of what car dealerships should aspire to in relation to service and customer care.

2022-09-03,5,"Went to have a look at a Mercedes at Mercedes Warrington and was met by Tom Smith? He was very knowledgeable, helpful and didn't push me at all. - It was such a pleasant experience I bought the car the next day and have been very happy with the service I received after the sale."
2022-09-01,1,When i went to pick up my car i had to wait at least 35 mins even though after asking the receptionist several times how long. At one point she thought i had already been seen. They still carried on making me wait until my husband had to call them directly while i awaited in the reception to be seen. When the mechanic came to see me his excuse was that he was on a call which i dont believe or the receptionist would have mentioned. Also after having a slow puncture in one of my tyres the mechanic said they found no issues and they re aired all the tyres. After paying for a b1 service charging an arm and a leg i am actually disappointed with their customer service and where ive had to get charged again to get someone else to look at my tyres.

All completed plus a a free fix of a rattle on the exhaust system I had mentioned when the car was collected...
Nice people and always very helpful and accommodating.
I highly recommend Coventry's Mercedes main agent.."
2022-09-01,5,"Professional, friendly and effective... Benz brand v well represented"
2022-09-05,1,Poor communications with the Mercedes Warrington over numerous issues. Collected the vehicle with works still outstanding. Still awaiting call back to rectify outstanding issues.
2022-09-05,1,"Following a recall via Mercedes UK for airbag replacement I took my vehicle at 0800 and dropped it off. Job was supposed to take 3 hours. Rang them for update 3 times, 3pm / 4pm and 5.45 pm. Never received a call back. Attended branch at 6.15 to find it closed ! No vehicle all weekend. When I did get it back. Dirty handprints all over, inside and outside. No real explanation as to why I was treated this way, just a pointless apology and an offer of a free valet. Will never purchase a vehicle from this company again."
2022-09-05,5,Great service with efficient friendly staff making sure the car was fit for purpose
2022-08-26,5,Great customer experience from Vicky Martin who strives to find me the best deal and kept me informed through the entire process. Also set up my vehicle to my personal settings. If you’re looking to purchase a new vehicle I would recommend using Vicky Martin.

2022-09-05,2,"Really quite uncommunicative & simply frustrating to deal with as a result. Had the same issue/fault on my car 3x. Finally resolved 3rd time, but now have a new issue with ZERO response in 10 Days"
2022-09-02,5,"Golf GTD, had a problem with warning lights coming on, only a couple of miles from the garage, so took it there without an appointment. Spoke to Natalia, who got it into the workshop straight away. Technician did a quick diagnostic check to confirm it required attention, left the car with them. Had a call from Natalia in the afternoon saying they had found the problem and the part had been ordered. Natalia called the next day pm to say the car was ready and I collected it the day after. Drove down to SW France a couple of days later, did 2000 miles in a week with no problem.
Natalia was excellent during the whole process, phoned me 3 times during the 2 days the car was in for repair, just to keep me informed of progress. Cannot fault the service, excellent."
2022-09-02,1,"Inchcape Norwich, awful, awful experience. Their sales customer service is very poor. Clearly they have no process for passing on messages.

I had to leave numerous messages (6 or 7) regarding a possible new vehicle order and / or contract extension over the last 2-3 months as nobody was ever available, no-one called back. My patience was running thin so I asked to be put through to the Manager prior to my holiday. He availed me platitudes and apologies and told me to ask for him on my return so he could deal with me personally.

I duly called him on my return and, unsurprisingly, I had to leave yet another message, this again was ignored. I called again today and he decided not take my call, instead I had to leave another message for someone else to ring me back!!!!

A member of staff actually called me back this time. He did indeed help with the contract which ironically took less than 2 minutes to sort out!

As for ordering a vehicle for in excess of £50,000 I will be taking my custom elsewhere.

I'm not saying they're incompetent, their customer service speaks for itself."
2022-09-01,5,"Just wanted to say how thrilled I am with my New Mercedes, Philip was incredibly patient and understanding to get me the car I wanted and work with my budget .

It’s the second car in 2 years I have bought from Mercedes’ Nottingham, both times I have dealt with Philip and has been superb .
Thanks again and I look forward to more deals in the future."
2022-08-26,5,Always really helpful staff. Great experience in purchasing new car.
2021-12-01,1,"*** BUYER BEWARE ***

I walked into Chelmsford ‘MINI’ and bought a mini at the end of December last year. I discovered 6 months later the car hadn’t been serviced since 2018. I bought the car in Dec 2021. It turns out apparently I wasn’t sold an approved used mini. I was sold an approved used INCHCAPE car. Apparently a car without a full service history meets their standards for selling a vehicle. Totally misleading and completely stuffed me. Given me a full service as a sorry but the vehicle remains a part service history vehicle. Utterly disgraceful and I completely believe I was mis-sold a car. Walking into a MINI main dealer apparently doesn’t guarantee you buying a car with a full service history or an approved used MINI. Left with a bitter taste in my mouth and I would absolutely never buy from any Inchcape dealership ever again. BUYER BEWARE"
2022-08-30,1,Customer service at it's worst! Was informed I had to have a 'free 15 minute health check' to be able to be provided with a tyre repair foam canister. None in stock when I had my puncture and had to wait over a week for one to arrive. 1 hour and 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment and I was told my car didn't need any repairs (which I was well aware of) and finally managed to get my car and foam canister back. Pathetic state of affairs.
2022-08-28,5,Excellent from start to finish. Great deals on the car and never felt pressured at any time by Darryl. Kept me up to date all the way through.
2022-08-17,5,"Usman looked after us very well. He was polite, friendly and professional ..... and not pushy which is usually the case of salesmen. What let the garage down slightly was the very poor print quality of printed quotes/information sheets that were hardly readable.I'm sure management will jump on this. That being said I feel very comfortable with my purchase and would not hesitate to recommend the garage and buy from them again. ."
2022-08-27,5,"I dealt with Mohammed who was brilliant from start to finish. A down to earth, honest, friendly guy. Always tried his best to resolve any issue and his communications were excellent. Responses to emails were mostly the same day and mostly within the hour. Cannot fault him."
2022-08-27,5,"Purchased a used Golf GTI, had an extremely helpful sales person called AnnieRose who answered all the questions I had without being a typical pushy sales person. Had a fresh MOT put on the vehicle before it was collected and all the little niggles I pointed out were sorted before collection day"
2022-08-25,5,"Car needed abs sensor replacement, done under warranty. Completed quickly and had a car wash too. Great experience"
2022-08-08,4,Had an excellent experience at Inchcape VW EXETER after a completely woeful response from VW ASSIST UK. Had no screens on our ID3 and then when they did return a message stated error in drivetrain please visit workshop. Contacted VW ASSIST on the advice of the dealership and told not to drive the vehicle only to be fobbed off by a VW ASSIST technician. Anna Davis at INCHCAPE EXETER subsequently looked after us superbly. Will probably be our last VW given the VW ASSIST response.
2022-08-26,5,"Brilliant service and very helpful staff, thank you Tom for all your help in making my purchase enjoyable"
2022-08-26,5,The dealership in Swindon could not do enough wonderful service would definitely use them again
2022-08-23,5,First class experience with Alex the salesperson
2022-08-26,5,Great service from MB staff as always. Friendly and polite and servicing done to a good standard and on time.
2022-08-29,1,"The staff was extremely rude and snarky with us. I took the car in on the 18th of August for a recall and I’ve been told it will be done on the 23rd for us. I phoned once on the 19th in the evening to ask if they have an update for us. Caroline Lawson told me and I quote: “why are you calling now? I told you it will be done on Tuesday [23rd]”
Fast forward to the 23rd I get a call from Caroline to tell me it will be done on the 25th. I asked her what do I do with the car provided by europcar as a hire car as they told me I only had it until 6pm the 23rd. She replied don’t worry about it just stay in the car we’ll sort everything out.
I didn’t trust her so I phoned up Mercedes roadside assistance and they said they had no clue that the hire car was supposed to be extended, and they extended it for me until Wednesday 24th.
On the 24th I tried calling Mercedes Cheshire Oaks again to ask them about the hire car but had no reply. So I called Roadside assistance again and again they had no updates from Caroline to say the car needs extending. I went into the garage at that point and managed to see Caroline who was extremely rude and said that roadside assistance are lying and that she provided details to them and that I shouldn’t have called, when I insisted that otherwise europcar would’ve picked up the hire car she called me a liar saying that that is not possible.

On the 25th I got my car back in the evening, I thought the car felt a bit odd with the steering wheel being extremely heavy and having no brakes at one point. There were loose panels on the car and damage done to the underside of the glovebox where a panel clips in. Due to that the panel cannot clip into place anymore.

On the 26th I got an engine management light on, called Mercedes Cheshire oaks who said they cannot help me as it’s Saturday. I was forced to call Mercedes Roadside assistance and wait on the side of the road for 2.5hrs. The technician finally arrived and mentioned that the Exhaust camshaft is not in sync with the crankshaft. Been told to drop it off at Mercedes Cheshire oaks, which I have and have had to wait nearly 8hrs for a hire car to get sorted. We’ve got a recording off the dashcam that shows 2 mechanics (I’ve been told that the one talking was Tom the service principal) saying and I quote: “The car drives mint, why doesn’t the timing come up every time?” Looks like they knew there was an issue and still returned the car to me faulty! This was released unsafe and considered I’ve had loss of brakes as well this could’ve potentially been fatal.

We were actually kicked out on the kerb to wait for a taxi outside on the roundabout because they closed at 5pm. The taxi finally came and took us to europcar in old Trafford!

The whole ordeal has been really bad giving us so much anxiety over this and my partner was reduced to tears on the 26th whilst we were waiting at the garage.

Currently still waiting for the car to be looked at again, and I don’t have much hope that they’ll do any decent job"
2022-08-23,1,Having a really bad experience with after sales.
2022-08-29,5,"Very good easy process, Jordan was extremely helpful all along."
2022-08-24,5,"Unfortunately we found ourselves needing a VW service centre after the EPC light on our Arteon came on for the second time in a month. We were visiting friends in the Shrivenham area and took the car to Inchcape. The reception we received was very welcoming and although we did not have an appointment we were assured, if we did not mind waiting, that if an opportunity came up to run a diagnostic on the car it would be done.
Long story short, there was a fault, it was rectified and we left with a driveable car and peace of mind, for which we're very grateful.
Thanks to the Inchcape service team for all your help.

2022-08-28,5,Very good from start to finish.
2022-08-13,5,"Jordan and Paul were

2022-08-27,5,Great service taken care of by Rebecca who kept me well informed and greeted with a big smile ! thanks
2022-08-27,5,We had an amazing experience when we purchased our new F-Type Jaguar. Thoroughly looked after by Kez who understood and acted on our wishes.
2022-08-26,5,"Very Reasonable Quote for the glow plugs, Diagnostics is monies worth they give your car a wash and software update, on collection of the car the person offers to take you out and show where the car is parked very nice gesture, first time came across such a thing was very impressed, bought the VW all in one plan as well because of nice service."
2022-08-19,5,I had an amazing experience at the station. Andy was also very helpful. I’ll recommend
2022-08-24,5,"Mercedes Liverpool, annual service and MOT, always respectful and helpful, always on time, always efficient, can't praise them enough."
2022-08-19,5,"Called in without an appointment to browse, couldn’t have been more welcomed by all staff. Natasha came over to chat about my options, and was just amazing sorting me out the perfect car, nothing was too much trouble, also the aftercare and updates have been fabulous too will be telling all my friends to go there to get looked after. Popped in a week later, all still remembered my name….it’s the little things - well done Audi and Natasha, thank you"

2022-08-26,4,"I was very pleased with the process of buying the second hand Polo which was hassle and pressure free. The salesman Dan was very professional and helpful . There was a slight delay in the vehicle being ready for which I have dropped a star. Upon collection, the car was immaculate both inside and out almost like new . I'm delighted with my purchase, it drives beautifully, looks great and I will definitely be happy to deal with Inchcape again."
2022-08-26,5,"Everything went as smooth, efficient and clear as it could possibly go"
2022-07-27,5,Very friendly and well managed centre
2022-08-26,1,"The sales service itself was ok albeit felt slightly rushed as Ant Bronze clearly values new car sales over used; although my purchase was nearly £45,000. Apparently it’s inconvenient for me to collect my new car during the middle of Ant’s busy selling days (Saturday).

What’s most disappointing is the aftersales service - non existent from Ant and his management team. Constant empty promises and various threats of complaints in order to progress the issues I raised at point of purchase. Probably one of the worst experiences I’ve had at any BMW dealership."
2022-08-25,5,"As always, Colin goes the extra mile to provide outstanding customer service."
2022-08-22,5,"Recent experience at MB Warrington for a service and MOT. Great customer service as always, efficient booking in and whilst had to wait a few weeks for an appointment because they are very busy, it was worth the wait given the level of care and attention they offer. Have used for well over a decade and wouldn’t take my car anywhere else for servicing."
2022-08-25,1,"Brought a car less than a year ago from the Basingstoke garage. I messaged them saying there was issue with seat belt as it would pop undone when I’m driving. They never got back to me so I left a review and they responded asking me to email their customer service team, which h I did. Then no one bothered responding. So here I am, I am now having to fork out nearly £3000 for a car I’ve had less than a year because the transmission has gone. These are a bunch of cowboys. Avoid!!"
2022-08-19,5,"Excellent service, kept informed of when the car would be ready and handover was an enjoyable experience."
2022-08-15,1,"On the plus side, if I could, I would give 5 stars to the Service Manager that looked after me, to the extent that after I had refused the quote provided for work, she still went out in to the rain, despite my protests, to find my car.
Audi as on organisation however should be ashamed of itself. I needed a pair of wheel bearings changed on my car, not a difficult job, and by an ""Experienced Audi Technician"" should take about 30/45 mins max per bearing so call it 90 mins to complete the whole job. Inchcape Audi quoted me £1,300 to do this work which is beyond outrageous! Even if one were to consider Audi OEM parts stupidly marked up in cost, so say £150 per wheel bearing, that still infers £1,000 in labour for 90 minutes work. I really don't know how they can sleep at night charging these prices and I can assure you I will never darken your doorstep again. Just so you know, I got the job done elsewhere with well reviewed and recommended parts for £350!"

2022-08-22,5,Everyone at Stockport were so lovely and the experience itself was really nice. Shoutout to Justin for getting the car I wanted to me! Everyone was so nice and bubbly at the dealership and overall really happy with the experience! Would recommend and would happily come back when it’s time to upgrade

2022-08-15,5,Very professional
2022-08-10,5,A great car at a good price and excellent staff.
2022-08-22,1,"I booked my car for the servicing and mot on a Monday morning then from here first time I heard from them was Tuesday morning,after I received the video I tried to get in touch with them to give the work approval, but the gut who was looking after my car didn't bother to call me back.I give them another call at lunchtime, then again the same message he will call you back. Nothing till 4 pm when I decided to email him and he was replied me back saying they are busy and if I want I can take my car to another service. I just said to carry on the work and to give my car at least next day by 2pm.
Next day I called them after 2pm,and they not even do anything to the car by that time.I called the main office to complain where they sorted out for me and I got a loan car in that day.so I got my car out from there on Thursday after 5pm.This is ridiculous, lack of communication between them and the customer, we are paying lots of money every time when we leave the car there,so we expecting to be treated with more respect. I am their customer for 10 years now,but this year was my last time when I will book my car there,and they not bother to reset the vehicle check from the computer board still red.Now I need to go back again for this.
I'm not recommended to anyone to fix their car here.(Reading garage)"
2022-08-17,5,"Car arrived couple of months early which was great. On the handover Patrick was great and explained everything clearly.
Only pity is that the GR sport doesn't have folding in mirrors when parking or front and rear sensors although it does have a reversing camera."
2022-08-18,5,Despite difficulties caused by a non standard windscreen the team successfully sorted the problem and completed the service as requested and kept me informed throughout
2022-08-19,1,Very poor service and very deceptive.
2022-08-19,1,"We book our MOT a month in ADVANCE, arrived on time at the MINI Norwich branch. Surprisingly told us it need service and will take 2 hours waiting, however it took 3 hours and 30 minutes. We are the first in the showroom before others, they are all gone however were still left waiting. Looking our car parking alone with no person working on it. Ask the desk, apparently due to the service. Pretty BAD, good excuse and tell you extra charges when arrive. What if you have further appointments book or not enough money to pay it all."
2022-08-18,1,"When you ask the sales person to give a true reflection of the car by sending you a citnow video as you won’t be able to see the car in person and will purchase over the phone, you accept the sales person to tell you the truth. Even after i asked her so nicely to zoom into all the areas where there is slight damages, she did the video from a distance so I wouldn’t see anything. In my opinion this sales person was more in it for the commission and lied all the way through to her customer which was me.
I received the car and was shocked to see the damages on the car which even a person with only 1 eye would be able to notice but i was told the car was perfect and even had a machine polish done to get rid off all the lights scratches. Amazing sales pitch is what i call it and that sales person has just gone and given the company a bad name that i would never ever recommend to anyone else to go buy a car from.

I made my complaint on the same day as the car was delivered which was on Friday 12th August and a business manager called John Spencer who sounded really professional and felt my pain said he would sort it all out. Also told me that he would change my view before i filled in this survey and guess what, its now Friday 18th and no reply. I have emailed him twice this week and no reply, what a suprise.
I call it bloody shocking and they are all the same at Inchcape VW Cheltenham

The sales person name was Rhiannon, please be aware before buying from her and strongly advice to go see the car in person than just buying over the phone. I mistake I’ve learnt from and will never do again."

2022-08-18,5,"Very helpful. Performed comprehensive service and very supportive and transparent in regards to what has been done/recommended fixes. Harish, overseeing the service on my car, was especially helpful and professional, going above and beyond what was required of him. Thanks very much."
2022-08-18,5,"We have just purchased our 4th new Mercedes through Phil Litchfield at Nottingham Mercedes. We’ve had a range of cars from the a class, CLA, A45 and now C300 amg line. We’ve always been really happy with every purchase and absolutely loved all of them. Our experience has always been smooth and hassle free thanks to Phil. We had a fault light appear on the dash with the new car but Phil got it sorted quickly for us and had it delivered back to our home for us in time to go on holiday. Absolutely would highly recommend Phil every time to family and friends 😊"
2022-08-18,1,My vehicle was in for a recall and had a complimentary visual check. The coolant filler cap was left loose losing 2 litres of coolant- very poor from a Mercedes’ dealer
2022-08-17,5,As usual brilliant service and attention to detail!
2022-08-17,5,Excellent service was contacted for a re-call on my car excellent service from start to finish
2022-08-17,5,Excellent service from Derby Mercedes Benz. Well looked after and very friendly.
2022-08-17,5,"Inchcape Chelmsford
Very impressed with this dealership, I called them enquiring about a car that I had seen online. I spoke with Ross, who arranged a test drive for me on the following Saturday. The car was lovely and we decided there and then to buy it. Ross kept us in touch through the week with what was happening, the car had a new MOT and a valet and I collected the following Saturday. 10/10 for this dealership. Would definitely recommend"
2022-08-17,5,Very welcoming. Straightforward handover of new car. Very informative handover.
2022-08-17,5,excellent customer service
2022-08-17,5,"In our experience, this should be the benchmark for all car dealerships.
From the moment we arrived, to leaving with our car was a first class experience, something you would expect from a brand such as Jaguar but don't always receive in todays world."
2022-08-16,5,James is an amazing salesman - he went above and beyond to ensure that we had the right car and the experience was seamless . We love our new Toyota .
2022-08-16,1,"Hi,

Purchased a smart couple days later I found a few issues with the vehicle and reported them straight away to address my concerns. I was under the impression as I bought the vehicle directly from the main dealer the resolution would be swift. I was very wrong I am still waiting for the issues I raised to be addressed, I have now escalated this to Mercedes’ Benz customer service as I have been ignored and felt like I am chasing a lost cause. I always buy my vehicles from main dealers to avoid issues so this experience has been disgusting to say the least. I have been accused of causing the issues my self and making it all up WOW. What can I say I am going to use my consumer rights to escalate this to the highest level possible as this is not right nor fair the way I have been treated and the solution that was provided."
2022-08-15,5,"Recently visited and purchased a vehicle from Wirral Inchcape. A fabulous experience. No pressure, very relaxed, knowledgeable and friendly. High praise to Johnathan C who added a personal touch to the transaction. Thanks to him and the entire team there."
2022-08-15,5,"Excellent service from Jake, nothing was too much trouble.
I would not hesitate to recommend the dealership."
2022-08-15,2,I was left waiting for 25 minutes to collect my Smart car after it's service. Other customers with Mercedes' being serviced that came in after me were seen before me and were offered drinks while I was ignored. The car service itself was excellent and advisories were explained clearly.
2022-08-15,5,"First class service at a very reasonable price.
Friendly and professional with no attempt to upsell unnecessary work. Jaguar XFR major service, car properly cleaned and vacuumed, and taxis into town and back whilst it was being done."
2022-08-15,3,"I was very impressed with lee in the servicing customer service team. He kept me updated throughout and even secured a hire vehicle for me due to delays in repair. He would get a 5 star rating

The reason I have marked as a 3 is due to the poor advice received. I took my car in with a suspected need for a wheel bearing replacement . 2 months, 3 visits and 3 new tires later it was confirmed that a new bearing was needed. I had to spend £600 on unnecessary new tires and, because I opted to get them done by a private garage to reduce the cost, vw were unwilling to provide any reimbursement . I felt let down by a process and seemingly poor advice aimed solely at generating a sale !"
2022-08-15,5,"Love my car, Daniel was so helpful and got everything sorted for me quickly and give me regular updates! Thank you so much"
2022-08-15,5,"Great dealership
They go the extra mile and we wouldn’t go anywhere else."
2022-08-15,5,"My purchase has been managed through Alex Curtis Nottingham who has been always on hand to help answer any questions I have, has gone above and beyond to give a 5* service and any issues that have arisen have been rectified promptly and professionally. Would absolutely recommend, thanks Alex for making my experience so smooth and positive!"
2022-08-15,5,"Excellent as always. Tod sorted everything out for me before I arrived to collect my new Mini. Could not have gone better, cannot fault. If only everything in life was as easy as buying a Mini..."
2022-08-15,5,"Secured me a brilliant deal, and looked after me wonderfully! Fantastic customer service!"
2022-08-15,5,"Recently bought a used car here, the trade in deal and service from Mark Bibby was excellent and the process couldn't have been easier."
2022-08-13,2,"I still adhere to my first review below regarding the purchase experience which I initially awarded five stars. However, that’s where my appraisal ends. I lowered the rating from five stars to two because of the after sale experience.
After completing the purchase before the end of the month as they insisted upon, the car remained at the dealership for two weeks for some touch up of chip marks and to rid of minor marks on the carpets, but when the car was delivered the marks were still there despite being told that a carpet specialist dealt with it and did what they can to remove them. Later I managed to clean the marks with a good scrub with soapy water. Also there was a small dent on the passengers door which I didn’t notice at the time of delivery but a couple of days later, a dent which should have been picked up during the pre sale inspection/preparation of the car.
At purchase I requested to add a service plan but they didn’t seem keen on the idea and they kept telling me it will be set up when the car is delivered. However five weeks later and despite my several attempts to contact them the service plan is not set.
Also I requested to update the start dates of the warranty and the extended warranty purchased to the date of delivery of the car and not the purchse date two weeks earlier but this was completely ignored without explanation.
I did not want to change my initial review for such trivial issues, But what really gets me the most is being ignored completely by not responding to any method of communication whether by e mail or telephone, that plainly is very rude and unprofessional.
I believe it is important that a curtsey call from the sale team after a few weeks of the purchase,to enquire about how the buyer is getting on with the car and whether there’s any issue to discuss. It’s equally important for the sale team to respond to enquiries made by the buyer in those initial weeks and not to be rudely ignored. It seems to me the dealership priority is to reach their sales quota without the after sale commitment, sadly this was not expected from a dealership of this caliber.


The whole experience was great. Arrived to the Oxford branch and after a short relaxing wait we met Natasha whom I was in contact with regarding the car of interest. After a brief look and a test drive we discussed a few issues to rectify and discussed my options regarding extras such as warranty and so on. Also met Osman who also was very pleasant and dealt with settling the payment and so on. The whole process was relaxing with no pressure or extreme sale tactics. As I changed my mind regarding the part exchange they were very happy to deliver the car to Southampton after settling with the minor issues that I have requested. Natasha herself delivered the car and was very happy to deal with any concerns of mine. So five stars for Mercedes Benz Oxford and the only regret I have that they are a fair distance away from Southampton to use them for after sale care."
2022-08-13,5,"I couldn’t be happier with the service I received, the team were so friendly and welcoming. It was the first time I had visited, I was really impressed. The team did a great job with my car. Thank you!"
2022-08-12,1,"For the second time MB Cheshire Oaks tried to charge me for a very expensive part that was covered by my warranty. I requested the General Manager to call me back to discuss this matter the last time which was over 6 months ago, but nothing. I’ve requested this again this time and 3 days have passed and still nothing. It’s such a shame because MB are fantastic cars, but they seem to keep trying to rip me off and tell me that things are covered under the extended warranty, when they are. I really feel for customers who don’t question this, and if I hadn’t I’d be thousands out of pocket."
2022-08-12,5,"Excellent customer service. Richard at Warrington, has exceptional customer service skills and looked after us, keeping us informed as our car went in for repairs."
2022-08-12,5,Bought a used car from here and was made to feel at ease and comfortable throughout the process
2022-08-12,5,"Recently had my RAV 4 serviced and its first MOT, plus an air con refresh. Cant be happier. The staff are polite and helpful, my car came back cleaned what more could you ask for. Thank you Inchcape."
2022-08-11,5,"Like always everything perfect. I was late For my appointment but still staff make sure they manage to take my car for service. Dave who take care of my car was a very nice guy. Helpful, he explained me all regarding Mercedes’ me app that didn’t work because of Hermes part. All fitted and my car is like new now :) Thank You - experience with Mercedes Benz Kidlington is always at high level 👌🏼"
2022-08-10,5,"The customer service received from Kyle was outstanding ,
His attention to detail is absolutely excellent
Nothing is too much trouble . He makes you feel you’re valued as a customer.
In my experience service personnel of his quality are few and far between .
An absolute credit to Inchcape and BMW"
2022-08-10,5,"Friendly and helpful staff.
Very accommodating.
Clean and well presented show room."
2022-08-10,5,"Dealt with Phil L at the Nottingham Inchape to swap my old car for another model. The whole process from selecting a new car to driving it away was hassle free, efficient and simple. Phil dealt with the finance and settlement of my previous car (which he gave a very good part exchange price for), he kept me up to date with the electronic paper work that needed completing without hassling me for it. Overall Phil has potentially kept me as a Inchape Nottingham and Mercedes driver for the the foreseeable future. Couldn’t recommend that you seek Phil out at Inchape if you are looking to purchase a new car. Thanks Phil."
2022-08-09,5,All was good in every aspect
2022-08-09,5,"Amazing service!!! Great staff! Go way beyond your normal garage to help you out! Good price for trusted work! :-).

2022-08-09,5,"Polite and helpful staff, and problems sorted on the day. Car cleaned and valeted before collection."
2022-08-08,1,"Additional requested work during a recent MOT and service was not carried out even though it was noted when booking appointment and when dropped off at the garage. Item was declared as checked and working on the service checklist but this clearly had not been done and made me wonder what else had been declared as 'checked' when in fact it had not even been looked at. Sent an e-mail to the garage re this but had no reply. On plus side, staff were friendly and car had been given a good clean when I picked it up."
2022-08-08,5,"I visited Inchcape Bolton because one of my car keys was not working. Ryan dealt with the problem quickly and professionally, much quicker than I had anticipated. Great customer service."

2022-08-08,5,"I found an approved mini I was interested in, sent a message to Inchcape and had a response very quickly. Made an appointment to come and try the car which was well prepped and ready Decided to have the car and it was ready to be collected a few days later. Actually I think it would have been sooner but I needed to fit in with my diary. Collected to car and had questions answered. all went very well. Ross white was available and helpful throughout the process."
2022-08-08,1,"Paid a reservation fee to Inchcape Kings Lynn only to discover the specification of the vehicle advertised was incorrect. The salesman apologised and said he would refund my reservation fee. Over two months later I am still waiting for my refund despite contacting LR Customer Services, Inchcape Head Office - all who promised to resolve my issue yet still nothing. Disgraceful behavior"
2022-08-08,1,"I am still waiting for Toyota Guildford to fix the door seal of my car from the day one I took it home about 5 months ago.

I got an email from the dealer after I left a review here. After replied them, again, no one follow up. And now, they left a reply here to pretend they are doing something for me."
2022-08-06,3,Too old for this internet nonsense
2022-08-05,1,"Bought a replacement lighter socket to charge my phone in the car.
When it came it was oval shape like someone had squashed it, sent a few emails and all have been ignored.
Super annoying."
2022-08-05,1,"Didn’t receive any details of what was needed for my service until I received an email after I left the dealership which suggests I need new tires - this could have been done while I was there!!
They also had to do a software update on my car - no details to what it was for or how it benefits me. When the girl asked the guy if it was happening today - he just snapped at her and said it will take an hour & a half - for me then to interrupt and said that was fine as I was waiting anyway. No idea if this software update was done as I was there a total of 2 hours - and normally this would be the time I would wait for the service.
When the guy told me my car was ready - just gave me the keys told me where it was parked and walked off - no other information passed to me - really really poor service that I’m really annoyed about"
2022-08-05,5,Really good service

2022-08-04,5,The team were really helpful from the booking process until collection
2022-08-04,5,Service team were great and sorted me out with a really nice hire car for the day
2022-08-04,3,Sales people great. However presentation of car bad. Paid extra for protection on paintwork but after it rained the rain did not roll off as it usually would …. Car looking terrible I am not happy. My husband now trying to valet the car to a standard that it should have been presented.
2022-08-03,5,Phoned up one day. Deal the next. Deliver in three. Understood needs. Customer first. Great car. Great customer service. Felt important. Chuffed to bits.
2022-08-03,5,Customer service was excellent.
2022-08-03,5,"Rob has looked after us so well. From the very first time we visited the dealership to explore options to upgrade our car, to the handover of our new vehicle, he has provided first class service. He kept us informed every step of the way, his attention to detail was excellent and he made us feel that we were his most important customer at all times. He helped us get set up in the new vehicle with all the important stuff such as connecting phones, using the satnav, the various controls (some of which were different to our previous vehicle). Nothing was too much trouble. Thanks Rob"
2022-08-03,5,A fantastic experience from start to finish. Great customer service - a master class from Sophie in how to look after customers and respond to their queries. Felt supported all the way.

Speedy service and very friendly."
2022-08-03,5,"We collected our eagerly awaited new Tiguan. Theo our salesman made the handover experience a very enjoyable process. Excellent all round for Inchscape, Chester."
2022-08-03,1,"Terrible. Firstly i booked a waiting appointment for an oil change at 12pm only to be told when i arrived that it would be around 3hrs to complete work. Who actually sits and waits for 3 hours ? if the idea is that you do not wait then what is the point of a set apt at 12 o'clock , why not just drop your car off first thing in the morning and then collect it at the end of the day . Either you need to change your terminology of what a waiting apt is or make it clearer that you will not be able to wait at the center. I had to walk to a local shopping centre and wait to be called with an update. When eventually i returned to the dealership, 2 hours 45mins after dropping it off (after no call from dealership) I didn't get my car washed or hoovered as i was told this would be another 30 mins and i was already going to be late for an important work call and had to take it without being cleaned

Secondly i specifically asked for my drivers wingmirror to be checked as it has not seemed right since i received the car from new . I clearly advised that it was not moving enough to be able to get a clear view of rear traffic unless you sat right back in the seat which is unsuitable for my wife. I asked for investigation into to see what the problem was and suggested it could be the mirror not sitting correctly in the housing or something else. When i collected the car i was told it had been checked and all was fine ...this was absolute nonsense , how could it be fine , ""nothing wrong with the mirror i was told "" I asked the representative if he had sat in the car and he said yes and it was ok . It wasn't until i said i would have to contact Audi direct as it could not be correct and i didnt know what else to do that the representative got back in the car to check and then immediately agreed it wasn't right , as it obviously wasnt . If i hadn't insisted it wasn't right then i would have been left with the issue and would have felt there was nothing that could be done when in fact i have no idea what you service engineers did with the car for 3 hours as they clearly did not check the wingmirror for faults .

I still now have to get my wingmirror repaired but will not be using Inchcape Audi in chester again, only the receptionist was helpful as she offered me a drink whilst I waited for my vehicle ."
2022-08-03,5,Carl is nice and helpful.
2022-08-02,3,"Good service - however my car is not three years old and the drivers door weather seal has eroded away. They would not accept it as a warranty repair with only 23k on the clock of a £97k executive 350S limousine.
Not going to buy Mercedes next time.

2022-08-02,1,"Mercedes Leicester

Appalling customer service! My car was recalled due to a SAFETY issue with the airbags. Took car into dealer and when the car was handed back on the passenger seat was a statement regarding a diesel upgrade, something not authorised! Airbags had not even been done and no one ever said anything. Car back with dealer for over a week and despite promises it would be returned as it was, I had to get a taxi to collect car despite for last 3 days promising it would be returned. Lied to about the update and what is had signed for. Rude and insulting staff, will be taking up with Mercedes UK and Inchcape UK. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
2022-08-02,5,Took my car for its routine service and check up. Great service and friendly check-in. I have used this dealership since it was SKF (Back in 1980) and always been satisfied. Car was ready as promised and a helpful Technician advised me about a technical mod. . I have never taken this car anywhere else for service and routine maintenance since new (2016). However some work reqiured was eye-wateringly expensive at about £1880 pounds. I checked a local Audi Specialist and using Audi parts and 12 month warranty the price was just over £600. I am sorry but for the first time ever Audi will not work on my car.
2022-08-02,5,👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
2022-08-01,5,"I visited the Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent branch of Bravo Auto and have been extremely happy with the service. All of my questions have been answered and any queries have been checked out. Everything that should have happened happened which included a MOT on the car I bought because it only had 8 month's MOT left and Bravo Auto guarantee a 9 month guarantee. The different finances were explained to me and different figures were used to see what was the best deposit I should give to ensure I got the best deal at the end of the agreement. I have not had a car for 10 years and was quite nervous about buying one but everyone I spoke to put me at ease and gave me confidence in them and the company. Well done,"
2022-08-01,2,"In short very poor customer service following the purchase of a second hand car from Bravo, the car had had fault on it and no one has called me to apologise or see if the issue is resolved, I paid over £6500 and expect better customer care."
2022-08-01,1,"Poor customer service and a poor representation of the brand. Vehicle not as advertised and company would do nothing to rectify the false advertising. I was due to leave on a boat that day and as the company knew all my transport paperwork for the vehicle was already registered, they took advantage and left me hanging. This is NOT what Lexus IS all about, I would know; I have owned four of them over the last 11 years."
2022-08-01,5,"Very quickly formed a trusted relationship, attentive to detail and the car was ready as agreed! Top notch!"
2022-08-01,1,Waited over an hour in reception after the service was completed. No update from staff. I have purchased three vehicles from here and my customer experience has never been good. Wish there was another BMW dealer in Reading.
2022-08-01,5,"I was very impressed with the service I received from Bolton Volkswagen, especially by Usman.

I usually hate going to dealerships and looking at cars as I find some salesmen pushy. Usman let me have a look about and ensured I wasn’t pressured into buying a car, to be honest I found the whole process fun and stress free!

I absolutely adore my new car and I will defiantly be coming back for my next one!

Thank you so much to Usman and your team!!"

2022-07-27,1,"This is the worst motor trader that I have ever dealt with. My Father purchased a Toyota Yaris from the Kidlington Branch, and the aggravation, rudeness and incompetence of this outfit has been unbelievable. When the vehicle started to go wrong, everything was blamed on my Father not using the vehicle sufficiently, this was all contrary to the advice we were being given by the AA at each respective call out. The car would sometimes start, sometimes not, and we were advised by thee AA that there was a fault on the ignition. He followed us through to the garage, and he even expressed how rude the staff at the garage were to me and my Father. Needless to say, the garage stated that nothing was wrong with the car, and the ignition fault light was normal. They bought the car back, and we handed over the log book, and we were assured they'd sort out contacting DVLA, as most garages do. Needless to say, a few months later, my Father received a letter from a credit company demanding £80 for non payment of tax disc. They hadn't contacted DVLA like they said they would, and I have rang them on 3 consecutive days to ask for a specific number from the log book for change of ownership, and they have failed to ring back. I complained to the Manager, and he sent a caustic email to one of his staff to advise me that the onus was upon me to update DVLA. The Manager appears to be as useless as the rest of his staff, and as the saying goes, the fish stinks from the head down. D"
2022-07-27,1,"Terrible experience!! We were mis-sold a £75000.00 Mercedes GLE AMG Coupe. The Leicester dealership assured us the missing parts would be ordered and retro fitted. We took there word for this and continued running the car. We were fobbed off for months until they eventually said the parts were never ordered and couldn't even be retro fitted. We are now entering a legal battle to get a full refund and reject the car, if necessary going through the Financial Ombudsman. We've been totally let down and should never have trusted them."
2022-07-26,1,"So I ordered a set of front car mats for my Audi A6 a month ago. Despite entering my reg number they still managed to send mats that didn’t fit. They initially suggested it was my responsibility to pay for the return postage then admitted they were having a problem with their courier. To date they haven’t picked them up, they’re refusing to refund me until they receive my return while admitting they’re on stop with the courier so they can’t pick them up. Beware of this shower of **** 👍🏻"

2022-07-26,5,My recent visit to Inchcape Toyota Derby was faultless. The service I received was second to none and nothing was too much trouble.

I would definitely recommend their service to other customers.

2022-07-21,5,Excellent service
2022-07-19,5,"I recently bought a new EQE from the Nottingham branch and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Phil Litchfield handled everything for us and went above and beyond when there was an issue with the original model we ordered, communication was first class and it was so refreshing to find such outstanding customer service. We had the handover today and Phil took his time explaining how everything worked and making sure everything was connected and we were happy before driving away. Fabulous experience, quick delivery and great customer service - I would recommend the Nottingham branch without hesitation especially if Phil is handling the purchase!! Thank you"
2022-07-19,5,First rate service together with helpful advice and information.
2022-07-19,2,"The loan car I used was filthy inside and I had to wait along time for my car following a service
I received a message to say it was ready but it hadn’t been cleaned as arranged"
2022-07-19,1,I took my car to be fixed but they didn't complete the job and staff wasn't friendly
2022-07-18,1,"I bought a used car in September 2021 from Inchscape Stockport and I’ve had the worse after sales service ever.
There was a 2 year warranty with the car and it wasn’t long before there were problems, a new cam belt was needed, a new cam belt tensioner and a drivers side electric window switch to name but a few.
We are now 10 months on and I am still waiting for all of the problems to be sorted out. After the third diagnostic test the last contact from them was on 15th June 2022 to say they would be in touch to book my car in within the week. Hey guess what a month later and they still haven’t been in touch.
Absolutely disgusting after sales service I wouldn’t buy from this company ever again.
So Emily the service manager your intervention was filled with empty promises as well!
Are you waiting for my two year warranty to expire then you don’t have to sort my car out!"
2022-07-18,1,When I booked the Express service it said it would take 1hr. When I arrived I was told it would take 1.5hr which it did. After the service it took me several minutes to find my car in the car park. I expected to see it outside the front door waiting for me. And finally the boot hadn’t been valeted!
2022-07-18,5,From enquiry to collection of my new car I cannot fault the professionalism of the dealership! Phil Lichfield has now sold me another car and I would recommend him to anyone. Excellent service and clear throughout the process and costings ensuring I was happy with the price for my part exchange and the new car. My experience of the dealership is excellent and of course my lovely new car is just as fab as expected!
2022-07-18,1,"To keep it short:
1, Great service to start with until it came to collection
2, Car was not ready for the day agreed and wasted a train and bus trip costing £15.
3, Was then promised the car to be dropped off at my house next day which did not happen
4, Was told short staffed so had to drive over and hour in another car to collect it at last minute
5, On inspection of the car the boot was full of dog hair and had looked like it has not even been cleaned on inside and out
6, Paint scuff on side of door edge which we pointed out when we placed the order and was told would be repaired was not repaired. The sales person then came out with a tub of small paint and started to touch it up. This was while we was waiting to get in the car and go home.
6, Business manager who i spoke to onsite did not seem to even care
7, Got home to then find the SatNav has faults and does not even work. To be told to contact Nissan to arrange a warranty repair
In all a very poor experience with the Burton branch and would not purchase from again or recommend to anyone else"
2022-07-17,5,"I would just like to thank Jordan for his excellent customer service.A great listener and paying close attention to detail for my model of car and budget.He worked tirelessly to fulfill my order.He is a great asset to Audi.Patient,friendly and not pushy.He’s cool and a great person and a professional.I will be recommending him to my friends and family for future business.Going to do very well.Thank you mate! 😎🙌 James Williams"
2022-07-13,5,The staff were very helpful and friendly with dealing with all my instructions. Great customer service.
2022-07-08,1,I was initially pleased with my purchase from Cooper BMW Reading but after only 3.5 years of ownership an engine warning light came on indicating an internal failure of the Heat Management Module. The car has only done 31K miles and was nearly new when bought from Cooper. Replacement and investigation bill for said Module was over £1000.
2022-07-07,5,"We had a very good experience with Mercedes at Stratford on Avon and the salesman Richard Beesly was pleasant and helpful throughout. We bought a Mercedes A class secondhand, and he was happy to show us several different models. They brought the one that we bought in from Nottingham so that we could try it."
2022-07-01,3,Bought a second hand Polo (63 plate). Great sales service. Needed a warranty repair. The work was carried out incorrectly and resulted in significant expenditure to correct (at another garage). When this was brought to their attention the error was admitted and I received full (and prompt) reimbursement of the money I was forced to spend. Congratulations on to VW Inchape on their response.
2022-06-30,5,"I would like to say that I had a very positive and helpful conversation with Chris Harkin at the Volkswagon garage in Swindon. He was pleasant and knowledgeable in answering my queries, and nice to work with. I will come back again!"
2022-06-30,1,"PLEASE READ IF HAVING AIRBAG RECALL,
I had my passenger and driver airbags replaced under recall on 27 June 2022, All was well until a few minutes after leaving Mercedes Benz Nottingham. when I noticed a distinct lack of power from the car, so as i was at a red traffic light I revved the engine and to my surprise the engine struggled to rev past 2500 rpm, which I know from past experience, the car is in limp mode, I tried to ring the service department at Mercedes Benz of Nottingham, but as it was 6.00pm there was no one there and a nice salesman advised me to call back after 8.00am in the morning.. I called back on 28 June 2022 and was asked to bring the car in, when I got in the car the next morning and started it, the engine management light lit up, it never came on the previous evening, I took the car back, as far as I am aware all they did was clear the faults codes, they didn't tell me what they were, and that they couldn't find anything wrong with my car they did offer to do further diagnostic checks for £101 per hour plus the VAT, which I declined as I am not convinced any faults with the car are down to me. After driving away from the dealership the engine management light was back on and the car in limp mode before I had travelled 200 yards down the road. I didn't have the time to return, so I went home. A little later I found out that I have had my ECU flashed or reprogrammed, something I was never informed would be done, either in the letter I received or when I dropped off my car, or upon collection. Now looking through a few Mercedes forums online, I find that the very same thing has happened to quite a few others, but no one seems to know why. and Mercedes deny all knowledge , 4 days on my car is still in limp mode and useless and no answer from Mercedes Nottingham, or Mercedes customer service.
Update 10 October 2022. despite mercedes commenting on my review of their dreadful service, ( see below) I sent them all the info they requested, guess what they did, absolutely nothing, So 3 months down the line from mercedes screwing up my ECU, I am £500 out of pocket, and mercedes just gave me the brush off AGAIN, just told me to complain to the motor ombudsman."
2022-06-29,5,Ben and Demetrius from Bravoauto in Chester did everything to make my purchase go smoothly. Would recommend.
2022-06-29,5,Really good and seamless. The entire process was faultless and meant it was able to be conducted completely remotely. Gemma was very helpful and answered any questions quickly and fully.
2022-06-29,1,"Appalling service. I visited Inchcape Mercedes Cheshire Oaks several times for car servicing as they are my local dealer. Each time has been horrendous and I has put me off the Mercedes brand. Twice my car went in for repairs and when I collect the car they had not actually done any work as they had ""run out of time"" despite being booked-in weeks in advance. The staff were rude and did not want to help. The 3rd time they ask for the car to be booked-in again and then on arrival they stated that they could not conduct any work as they could not find a fault, despite having the fault pointed out to a technician in person. They also had the nerve to try and charge for not conducting any work. They then fitted a cheap knock-off tyre brand to the car when it went in for non-related repair..... Appalling people, appalling service , appalling company.,,"
2022-06-29,4,Initial contact and salesperson not good but whole deal saved by hard work of rest of team and Sales Manager who were excellent
2022-06-29,1,"EDIT: I did contact the Inchcape email, only after the Bravoauto one bounced back, as not in service. I also tried to book the car in for routine service. The number on the service plan contract is Carstore-an Evans Halshaw company. Just unbelievable incompetence!

Purchased an Outlander PHEV in May from Shrewsbury. No home charging cable, just some grubby type 2 to type 1 lead for public charging. Replaced, after complaining. Car in a week later; heater not working and howling sound. Returned with 'nothing wrong with the heater; has to be in petrol mode for it to work'. After research via a public PHEV forum written by those who've owned these cars for a long time and publications in specific motor repair journals, I now know this to be completely untrue and that the heater not working is a well known and 'under warranty' fault. Car also has knocking noise on low speed and in reverse. Likely to be the motor mount. Also, a known fault. Contacted via online service return call to book car in for these things to be addressed. Not heard a dicky bird because clearly, they don't want to know. Next, will be a complaint in writing as car has extensive warranty, which I have paid for 'to be looked after' (their words, not mine) and if no joy, I will be forwarding Inchcape, or BravoAuto as they are known for their used car sales, a 'Letter before Claim' and will contact Trading Standards. No excuse for this level of customer service. Appalling."
2022-06-28,5,"Excellent service, great at keeping me regularly updated on progress of new vehicle"
2022-06-28,2,"We visited Inchcape Chester to buy a brand new vehicle, Landrover Discovery.

We met with the sales rep' who was attentive, well informed and extremely helpful, without being pushy.

We revisited the following day and sealed the deal with that same staff member, arranged collection in 7 days time. Very happy.

There then ensued a series of disjointed phone calls to ourselves, all by different staff members, requesting details that had been previously been provided.

No less than 7 calls were made by ourselves asking for clarity regarding the sale . On each occasion we were promised a call back, nothing ever materialised.

On the day of collection we arrived looking forward to taking ownership of our new vehicle and to experience an informative handover, this was not to be.

The sales person tasked with this did not introduce himself and was clearly preoccupied with completing the final paperwork.

Answers to questions, which we considered be of a basic nature, regarding Landrover Recovery and transfer of a private plate were not known and a visit to seek advice ( to his credit ) occurred on 3 occasions.

Outside, the handover of the vehicle was no better and disappointing with us having to ask numerous questions regarding the function of various controls and even whether the requested tow bar had been fitted. There was no flow or structure to the handover and again advice had to be sought from the Business Manager, as no other was available.

Maybe we were expecting too much but we would have liked the handover to have been akin to a presentation of the vehicle to us.

A disappointing experience and we drove off somewhat deflated.

At the point of sale we had been told that our part exchanged sum of £19,100 would be transferred into our account within 48hours, two weeks later we were still waiting.

Further telephone calls were not returned to us so an appointment to visit Inchcape Chester to sit down with a supervisor was made.

The supervisor summed the whole process up as saying that we had clearly not had the best experience and when the aforementioned occurrences were relayed to him he stated he didn't wish to have us leaving, having purchased a new vehicle, and not looking forward to returning to Inchcape Chester.

He stated that he was off the following day but he would definitely telephone us the day after with “ something” for us, that would go some way to making things up to us.
This was not something we had alluded to.

Unsurprisingly, that telephone call was not made to us and a month later we have still heard nothing from him.

In summary, a smooth and pleasant couple of hours spent deciding and agreeing upon the purchase.

Thereafter, 6 weeks of relentless calls to Chester seeking confirmation or assistance with little or no interest expressed and calls rarely returned.

Finally, the aforementioned was emailed to the head of Chester Inchcape and guess what ? correct , no response from him either !

A lasting impression of a branch that has little regard once the deal is agreed.

In a nutshell, an underwhelming experience."
2022-06-27,5,Amazing customer service friendly people and alot of help
2022-06-27,1,"The worst customer service!
Sold us a car without any service history
The car had engine problems within a year of being purchased and wont fix the issues because they 'didnt have the capability'.
Wouldn't recommend at all !!!"
2022-06-27,5,"Very good experience of buying a car from Inchcape. The car is well suited to my needs. The staff member very kindly dealt with us in the quieter end of the showroom. The other end, where some very loud and very bad music was playing, was essentially uninhabitable. I understand that the staff have no control over this, and it is surprising that they can still be nice to people at the end of the day."
2022-06-27,4,Car only went in for a map update which was done whilst I waited.
2022-06-27,1,"Had to book ahead a number of weeks. However my car was not attended to until after I chased late in the day when I had not heard anything. Needless to say my car was not ready that day so I went back the next day as arranged and spotted my car in the car park. However was then told they had fitted the wrong battery (wow!) so this would need to be fixed so had to wait some more. Again only attended to once I was chasing. Very poor experience and very disappointed. Only plus, the junior technician sent out by her managers to 'pacify' me was polite, apologetic and professional but she was embarrassed by the poor service I had received.
Also still waiting for a copy of the 'free inspection' checklist which I normally receive and also a link to the star video of the inspection - I have asked three times, once when I finally collected my car, once via the website, and once again today on a phone call. I am starting to think that the inspection and video never happened although they are listed on the invoice so I guess I have some legal comeback - ?"
2022-06-27,5,Had a great service thank you.
2022-06-27,1,"Earlier this month I bought some parts from inchscape Audi Swindon,the parts arrived but were not for my car.I called to try and rectify the situation but they didn't answer until eventually when my credit card provider called them and got through to the sales manager. He spoke to us like we were fools then begrudgingly offered to collect the incorrect parts and refund me ,two weeks later he has done neither!"
2022-06-25,5,Cooper Reading continue to give excellent service and repair to my two BMWs over many years.
2022-06-24,5,"As always efficient, friendly and extremely helpful."
2022-06-24,5,"I contacted Audi in Swindon to upgrade my car (and I'll be honest my previous experiences with the garage have been very poor) and got passed to a lovely gentleman called Fraser who has been nothing short of fantastic in helping me with my options. He calls back when he says he is going to (rare in this day and age!!), he provides excellent customer service and really LISTENS, all with an engaging personality and and cheery manner! He has been an absolute pleasure to deal with and whilst I have made the decision to keep my current Audi I would 100% recommend him to anyone looking to purchase an Audi or even just consider their options! Not a pushy salesman, just clear, honest and friendly help and advice! Thank you :)"
2022-06-23,4,"I think the front of house is excellent. I received a worksheet of the tasks to be carried out and knew what was to be done. It was an express service, with a couple of manufacturers updates. All completed in an expedient manner. The reason I have not given 5 Stars is the fact that I do not know what they did on the Service: oil Cx, filter Cx, ad blue top up. What should have been done - I am blind to this. I have paid good money and do not know what was carried out. I do know the ad blue was not topped up: should it have been?"
2022-06-21,5,"Called and spoke to Arron Jones about a Golf GTD we'd seen on auto trader, we decided to go ahead with the purchase. Arron explained the benefits of having some finance on the car with VW so we went ahead with that too. I needed to call a couple of times to ask questions and to get help signing some digital documents, Arron was most helpful and always called straight back if he wasn't at his desk. The car was delivered exactly on time as requested, couldn't be happier so far."
2022-06-20,5,"Helpful staff, available all the time, answered all my questions, and made a smooth purchase"
2022-06-20,5,"Fantastic service, Thanks."
2022-06-20,5,I was contacted by VW as my car needed to be updated and was advised of the current situation with sourcing vehicles. My lovely sales assistant Carl Fraser guided me through my options and booked me a test drive. On delivery day Carl explained everything I need to know and did all the computer bits and bobs. Excellent service in the garage and excellent after care service job well done very happy customer.
2022-06-20,1,Terrible car comeback with same problem having to pay someone else £2000 deposit and £144 a month for a car that’s sound awful to drive never using Toyota again
2022-06-20,5,Great customer service!
2022-06-20,5,Very good service
2022-06-20,5,"Staff were very welcoming and extremely pleasant to speak to. Their presentation and presence is very positive.

Service was done in good time and my car weirdly enough developed a problem with its right indicator as I got back into the vehicle, the technician kindly took it back right away to rectify which was nice of him and within 10m or so was done and all working! looking forward to coming back again as I have a service plan :)"
2022-06-20,5,"We have just purchased a car from Phillip Litchfield and and we were over the moon with the service we received from him!
Phillip is extremely knowledgeable about Mercedes cars and especially our model.
He is patient and kind and friendly. Kept in touch with us every step of the way and responsive to our telephone calls!
Phillip made the whole experience seamless and actually pleasurable.
Thank you Philip you are absolutely amazing!

2022-06-18,1,"Had car picked up for 2 faults to be investigated and they confirmed what needed to be corrected. I was informed that I would be contacted the following week to see if issues would be covered under warranty, 3 weeks later and 4 messages for a callback still no response."
2022-06-16,5,"Best car, best service and outstanding Sales service provided by Phil ( Philip Litchfield) .
Philip is reliable, trustworthy and does his job swiftly, and he genuinely cares about his customers. He is a seasoned sales executive and I find him full of knowledge regarding how to sort out everything in one go!"
2022-06-15,5,"I had owned VW vehicles for 10 or so years before moving over to BMW, as I was unhappy with the VW service. After 2 years with BMW I decided to give VW a try again and have been extremely impressed with the service provided by Dan Harrington. I was looking to purchase a new MK8 Golf GTI and had been offered a good deal on a new vehicle from BMW. Not only was Dan happy to help he went above and beyond what I would have expected in order to find me the right car at the right price. I placed a deposit on a vehicle being held in group at another location on Tuesday 7th June and drove away in the vehicle on Saturday 11th June, I couldn't be happier.

My wife is currently with Mercedes and will be coming over to VW when her deal expires with Mercedes next year. Well done Dan and VW, you have won a customer back."
2022-06-14,5,"first class service as usual, thank you."
2022-06-14,1,"Trying to buy a car from Chelmsford BMW. Reception doesn't answer the phone, just rings & rings. You then leave a message & no-one rings back. Hopeless!"
2022-06-13,1,"Poor.
Terrible communication. Worst wash and clean. Left swirl marks.
Remember, this is a performance car."
2022-06-12,1,"If I could give a 0-star I would. I bought a brand new GLC Coupe from Stratford-upon-Avon, experienced a leak within the warranty period which I reported. This was looked at but the fault was not rectified and it caused major water damage which has resulted in repair costs of circa £15,000. They are not willing to take responsibility or honour the repair work so I'm now in the midst of a legal battle and have been without a car for 5 months. Absolute disgrace! Don't buy anything from these charlatans!"
2022-06-12,5,The sales Mr. Jas Dhani friendly and enthusiastically introduced the technical configuration of I wanted to know of Mercedes Benz GLE AMG Line Prem Plus. He is a good sales.
2022-06-10,1,I brought the car in with a fault which was dangerous. I was told my car couldn't be seen for 5 days as they were too busy and sent away. I complained to Mercedes and they arranged for it to be collected seen the next day and given a hire car. Why was i not offered this in the first place with the car being less than 2 years old.
2022-06-10,5,Special thank you to Harry in Fleet Sales . Harry is a professional i have nothing but praise for the way he has helped organising and liasing with my customers whilst i have been away from the offers thanks again Harry your a star Steve from IFM
2022-06-07,5,Great friendly firm
2022-06-06,5,Took delivery of my new car from Lewis Davis at Mercedes-Benz leicester. He could not have been more helpful and went the extra mile to make sure that everything was OK. He is very professional with a good sense of humour. Certainly recommend going to him again.
2022-06-06,1,"Car was booked in for 9:45 on 30/05/2022 with display issue going on and off every 20 seconds. Car dropped off at 9:30. It takes 30 min walk to work. Harry called at 15:47 to say need to have car overnight to update software or book in again which would be 4 weeks later with a lone car, not acceptable so agreed to leave car with BMW. I had to arrange my wife to pick me up and drop me at work following day 1 hour round trip. Received text and email video of Health check that had a red (urgent issue) at 16:29 with exhaust system bracket / joint so authorised work at 16:30. On 31/05/22 received call from Harry at 12:05 stating car ready software update worked, I asked about the other work Harry did not know work had been authorised so he said he would get work done. I did not hear anything until I called at 16:16 and then again 16:19 I asked the person who answered to leave a message with Harry to call me back with an update as he was on another call they said. I did not get a call so I had to call again at 16:50 this time Harry answered he said he needed to check, he the left me hanging on the phone for 18minutes (not acceptable) and the said they needed a part so need the car overnight again or I would need to book in again this was now after 17:15 so had no choice but to leave overnight again and arrange for my wife to again pick me up very late from work and drop me off the next morning. I then wanted to raise a formal complaint and said this to Harry who said he would inform manager who would call me. Harry called on 01/06/22 at 12:47 informing car was done and ready to pick up. I then walked to BMW 30 min to get car I waited a further 15 minutes to get key for car as I had paid the bill online earlier again very long wait. I checked the mileage and it seems that 33 extra miles were on the mileage why? I still have not received a call other than a text to call Paul Smith he should be calling me. In total BMW had my car for 3 days I do not think this is acceptable I had to get my wife to pick me up and drop me off for 2 days I was left on phone for 18minutes and was not called for updates even when I was told this would happen. Work was not carried out on time so communication within BMW and with me was unacceptable."
2022-06-06,5,"Chloe (in Service) was absolutely amazing in her customer care. She was very quick to understand my needs as a customer, and get an urgent tyre replacement booked in for the same day - despite having issues with the tyre supplier. I had a very negative experience with Lexus Nottingham, they were very unhelpful and misleading in their communications. Chole at Derby on the other hand, managed my expectations perfectly and even liaised with Nottingham directly to try and help me (as Nottingham is closer to where we live). If Lexus Nottingham can learn some lessons from Lexus Derby they might do themselves a service. Chloe could answer all of my questions clearly, knowing about tyre stocks, costs, my account and timescales. Nottingham kept passing me between Service and Parts and I was passed between each department about 5 times after 10minutes of a total time waste. Derby - keep up the great work, you can be proud of your impeccable service!"
2022-06-06,1,"Whilst the staff are very pleasant and the facilities modern and professional looking, the feedback I get from Inchcape has made me lose all confidence in the Land Rover product. I am currently looking for a new car but cannot go to Land Rover due to the issues in the vehicle (some I believe to be false) and the up-selling of repairs each time I get it serviced. I will never go back to Inchcape or take my vehicle there again."
2022-06-06,5,Szymon was very knowledgable and professional and dealt with our purchase efficiently. I would definitely recommend this dealership.
2022-06-04,5,Great service from Stockport Audi they collected and delivered my car after it’s recent service. Seamless and professional ..can’t fault them..👍😊
2022-06-03,5,Very helpful
2022-06-02,1,"I'm absolutely furious, I took my car here to Jaguar because I felt it would be in safe hands.
How wrong was I, one of the front parking sensors is missing completely, then the one of the actual fault's it went in for lit up on the dash when driving home after being charged £120."
2022-06-01,5,"Faultless service, I’d never go anywhere else because of this. When life is busy you always appreciate the efforts of others to make things as simple for you as possible and that’s what Inchcape do."
2022-06-01,5,Really pleased with the service. I was kept fully up to date at every stage of the process and because this was done by text messages I found this to be a very convenient way to keep in touch with the sales representative
2022-05-31,3,"Disappointed that I booked a 1 hour express service for 0830 due to work commitments and eventually left site at 1045.
This was mainly blamed allegedly on the Valeter not wanting to wash/Valet that day. To be honest, he shouldn’t have bothered as the vacuuming of the vehicle (which I watched through your gates) was very poor and the cleaning of the dash was left with dried, streaky and dirty water marks, hence I had to do it again at home."
2022-05-31,5,"We visited the Swindon showroom on a somewhat indirect way home from holiday with a view to potentially purchasing a VW T-Roc I had seen advertised online. Our proposed morning arrival turned out to be about 1pm on a Friday afternoon. Edward SchluppTaylor, the sales executive, proved to be patience and helpfulness personified! Eddie provided truly excellent service, answering all our concerns and providing appropriate reassurance."
2022-05-31,1,"Booked in at Inchcape Reading last week to have an aircon service which I was advised on the phone would take 45 mins. Arrived and told it may take an hour but someone would let me know and to sit in the customer waiting area. 20 mins later returned to reception. Was then confirmed that would be 45 mins.
90 mins later returned to reception. Was told that it would be another 20 mins.
To cut a long story short it took a total of 3 hours!! The manager apologised and said it was something to with them not having enough oil in a piece of their equipment and was a new system they hadn't used before so I didn't understand how it couldn't have any oil in it?!
Anyway, they didn't charge me and as I had missed a later appt manager said would send me £50 to compensate. A week later no compensation. Left a message for manager and was assured he would return my call. No call but next day the money miraculously appeared in my bank account.
I had already had a conversation with the manager about lack of communication and then he didn't even have the courtesy to return my call.
Inchcape, communication with customers and amongst your staff is severely lacking.
Needless to say, won't be returning here again."
2022-05-30,1,"Spent 6hrs today trying to buy a car from Preston site. Called on Saturday to book viewing, had a test drive on Sunday expressed our interest, called back Monday morning 11am told someone down south had shown interest so car on hold for 3hrs!! i rang back at 3pm as no feedback given, told to wait for call from Louis, called again at 4pm still nothing but reception told us car was possibly being viewed now? called again at 4.45pm ask for Manager, told not available, 2 mins later get e'mail from Louis saying car is now sold.. disgusting way to treat potential purchaser."
2022-05-30,5,Excellent service from Tom Many thanks
2022-05-30,5,Excellent quick service after car broke down. very Polite. Well organised dealership which kept me informed of repair progress all the way till completion highly recommend
2022-05-30,2,"I dropped my car off and I was informed by the receptionist that somebody would ring me when my car was ready. It towards the end of the day and nobody had rung me so I rang to find out what was happening. The receptionist found out who was looking after my car and told me she would ring me back within the hour. Over an hour went by and I rang again and the receptionist went to find out what was happening and came back and said I could pick my car up, she seemed somewhat indifferent when I explained about not receiving the promised phone calls. As it was too late to collect my car, I said I would collect it the next day.
I arrived to collect my car and the receptionist went to let service know that I had arrived to collect it. After 30 minutes of standing out about the receptionist went back to the service department to tell them I was still waiting. The lady from the service department came out with the paperwork and told me that they had been unable to find the fault I had reported with my rear air suspension, fair enough I thought. She was unable to answer any of my questions re the functioning of the rear air suspension or the warning light that comes up on the dashboard. I paid and left."
2022-05-30,2,Inchcape BMW Ipswich. I have been here 3 or 4 times now and gave benefit of doubt. Communication skills of customer facing staff need urgent work. My experience is that some come across as rude and unhelpful.
2022-05-27,5,"Professional, polite and efficient.
I have only one other experience at car a dealership to gauge by, but it was nothing like Inchcape Norwich.
Friendly, non pushy and helpful staff that know that I can spend my money somewhere else if I want to, complimentary coffee, unaccompanied test drive; an all round positive experience.
I could probably have bought a similar car for less money at a used car dealer but I wanted the peace of mind that comes from buying from a company that would stand behind what they were selling.
It's a lovely car and I'm really happy with it, and the back up that I've received so far has proved to me that I made the right decision by choosing Inchcape."
2022-05-27,1,"If i could give Inchcape Derby Land rover no stars i certainly would. Ordered my new model sport on the Land rover site and they promptly took my deposit and confirmed "" your order has been placed "" i choose Inchcape Derby as my chosen supplier and was told they would call me within 24 hours.
48 hours later i called them and left a message for them to return my call which they didn't so i called again and spoke with a very obnoxious man called Damien O'Neil who didn't introduce himself or apologise for not returning my call.
He then proceeded to ask me many questions to ascertain if i was worthy of being supplied with the new Range Rover Sport as he told me i might be the type of person that sells it on for a profit, especially as i am the Director of a Finance Brokerage that does car finance, i told him i had no intentions of that and that i had bought a Range Rover from them in the past, also both myself and my wife drive Range Rovers, my company as almost 7000 reviews on Trust pilot and we are ranked number 1 in the country for customer service in our field and not one review will suggest i or my business sells cars.
Damien who according to Linkedin is the Head of sales ( WELL THATS A JOKE ) wasn't interested and said he would take advice and get back to me.
This chap never did get back to me or return any of the calls i left for him.
Also you should note that Land rover dealers get you to sign to say you cannot sell your new model for 12 months and when you do it must go back to the dealer franchise network .
So all in all i was paying £103,000 to buy my new car have no intention of selling the car on to make a profit lol and should i or any other unfortunate buyer have a major problem you are not allowed to sell your own belongings, ( I HAVE A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT THAT CONFIRMS YOU CANNOT SELL )
I made my complaint to LandRover Direct who also failed to get a response from this dealership.
My Sincere advice is do not deal with Inchcape Landrover Derby under any circumstances."
2022-05-26,1,"Poor because I am unable to book in my car until July. We are in May. I have a car that drains the battery overnight, despite it being locked and all things switched off. The AA have been called out for a third time, for the same reason. If I was to wait until July for Inchcape to find the fault, I will probably have to call the AA another 32 times. There is no means of getting an emergency repair."
2022-05-26,1,The car was not checked thoroughly before hang it over to me.
2022-05-25,5,Brilliant experience from start to finish - Special mention to James Albon brilliant service
2022-05-25,5,Great and easy experience getting my new car and selling my old car at Mercedes’ Benz Liverpool with David sherwood would highly recommend
2022-05-24,5,Phil Litchfield at Mercedes Nottingham provided us with a great service. He identified our needs straight away and we didn’t feel like he was trying to sell us anything we didn’t need or want. He answered all our questions honestly and we trusted him explicitly to get us a car perfect for us - which he did! Would highly recommend Phil to family and friends.
2022-05-23,5,"From start to finish Stuart Lane was very informative and helpful, all questions asked were answered professionally, when picking the car up he was also very helpful and friendly, went over all controls of the car and made my transaction with ease and stress free. Jon Thornton was very helpful to with additional information I needed and answered all my questions confidently. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone. Thanks for great service…"
2022-05-23,5,"Excellent, professional and efficient service, all thanks to Paul and team 👍"
2022-05-23,5,Car taken in 21st May for a service. Welcomed at the front desk promptly and my car was ready to collect in 2 hours. Serviced and valeted. Excellent service
2022-05-23,5,"Michael Stubley of Mercedes Nottingham was a delight to deal with when I was looking to purchase my next Mercedes. He listened to what I was looking for and found and ordered my lovely new A250 to the exact spec. and colour I wanted, managing to sort out all aspects of the deal to meet my expectations, indeed exceeding them. He made the whole experience so easy and pleasant and I highly recommend him and Mercedes Nottingham to anyone considering their next car purchase. Thanks Mike!"
2022-05-23,5,"Service and mot went smoothly, everyone was very helpful, nice clean car returned to me, many thanks"
2022-05-23,5,Thanks again every visit to Merc Nottingham is a great experience love the coffee and Jo was a delight 5stars
2022-05-23,5,"Excellent service, I received fantastic experience buying my second new car with Philip. He’s the right person in the right place. I trust him 100%. I don’t need to worry about anything, Philip sorted everything out very fast and professionally from the beginning to the end and the car was ready to go in two days. I would highly recommend buying a new car from the Mercedes-Benz dealership of Nottingham. Many thanks to Philip and the sales manager Craig for the best service we received from you guys because now I’m the proud owner of the amazing GLE COUPE. 👍🏻"
2022-05-23,1,"Terrible dealer do not use. They cancelled an order after 10 months, then go on to say we can’t give you any discount on a different car to get you near the cost you was because “there is demand and someone will buy it if you don’t” - rude seen as you, the supplier had to cancel my order then not even help me resolve it!
I now wont have a vehicle to use for near to 9 months!

I understand factory have problems but to not even try help resolve it and then ignore you.

Involves Oxford dealership and Derby Dealership."
2022-05-20,1,"Terrible Dealers
Worst garage ive ever had to deal with.
Took them over 6 months to tell me they wont sell me a car. 2 months of that time i rang them weekly for updates with no return phonecall.
Avoid these and go to Lloyds at Colne who are much better organised"
2022-05-19,1,"I have asked to book my car in for an auxiliary battery change and I was told this need to be investigated. I said the car is clearly indicating that the auxiliary battery is malfunctioning, still I was told this need to be checked to see if there are any other issues. 6 hrs later and not even a phone call. I had to chase twice for an update. Then finely someone came back to me and said they want to charge me for the investigation, the part and the labour. Part and labour ok, but you literary charged me for investing something my car already clearly indicated. You found nothing else wrong with the car. I was told that this message is sometimes showing but it is not always correct, which is ridiculous! Why would such car be designed to show the user an incorrect message I asked?? Surely this is a design fault I said - the lady had no answer! Still charged me - for telling you - what is wrong with my car. Even tho she could not substantiate the cost. I had to pay! If you would have found something else, then fine I would pay, but you did not. You insisted on investigating and found nothing but confirmed the car was correct in saying the battery was malfunctioning. I should have not been charged for the investigation. That was not right and not ethical for you to do so, in this situation. I am not happy with the service. On top of this, no updates and it took far too long to deal with my car on the day."
2022-05-19,5,We visited Mercedes Nottingham and salesman Phil looked after us and we couldn’t be happier with the excellent service we have received. Phil took the time and effort to find us our new car after we discussed with him what we we were looking for. The service from Phil was outstanding he kept us updated all the way and met us on the day to hand over our new car. He made this very special for us and presented the car with a personalized name board and the car covered something we never received from our previous Mercedes dealership. Thank you so much for all your help and we will be back. Highly recommended this dealership.
2022-05-19,5,Very helpful and polite
2022-05-19,5,"Bought a GLE 450. No salesman pressure and available, helpful and knowledgeable when I needed them. Also the service people took time to explain the service plan on offer. In summary, a very pleasant experience."
2022-05-18,1,"MOT errors ??

Had my car MOT'd at Inchcape in Chelmsford and just noticed they added 3000, extra miles on DVSA register and MOT certificate. Car had only done 14,900 - they put 17,922. Not even close. Not my first run in with this garage. Incompetent doesn't even come close to describing them."
2022-05-17,5,"I don't know about you, but buying a new car is not something I do very often. It makes me highly nervous departing with a lot of money on a vehicle I need to enjoy driving. So I'm delighted that I ventured to Inchcape in Basingstoke to look at Toyota's options. I was very impressed. To cut a long story short, I viewed the cars available, test drove one, ordered it and have just picked it up (sooner than initially expected). The whole process was made easy by the staff there and I have come away with a very positive impression. Oh, and a great car!"
2022-05-17,5,"Excellent faultless service, nothing too much trouble.
Well done"
2022-05-17,5,Excellent customer service
2022-05-17,5,We keep returning ... there must be something in it ... GR8 Team !
2022-05-16,5,A very good experience and would recomend Inchcape and Mark Wilson who looked after us so well.
2022-05-16,5,Collected my new Mercedes and was very well looked after by Gavin Berry. Most of the paperwork was already done online so there was little to do on the day. Gavin gave an excellent tutorial on the car controls and checked the ME App was working correctly. Excellent service.

Despite giving poor feedback, they never ask why!"
2022-05-15,1,"Poor Service - Altrincham VW
I purchased a used golf GTD from this dealership that on closer inspection had serious problems with the paintwork, after giving them a fair opportunity to repair the car, which wasn’t fulfilled to my satisfaction. I expressed my right under the 21 day money back guarantee and decided to return the car, I waited nearly 3 weeks for my full refund of just under £4,000 to be returned. The service was absolutely awful, phone calls and emails not answered or returned from Tony, Mark or Gavin, I had to threaten legal action to receive the full deposit amount back. After this email to Gavin it arrived the same day, but with no apology or explanation whatsoever. If anyone reading this needs to return a car, make sure that you don’t take it back until the money is in your bank first."
2022-05-14,5,"Wonderful service, friendly and welcoming. Service carried out in good time. Would recommend them to anyone."
2022-05-13,5,My wife and I were looked after really well by Douglas the Motability advisor he has really gone the extra mile for us many thanks from both of us
2022-05-12,5,"Ian from mini inchcape was brilliant. He gave me regular updates on when to expect my new car, even when their was delays. Advised me on paperwork I would need to take with me when collecting car."
2022-05-12,5,"Just purchased a C63s from Inchcape Coventry (Mercedes Benz of Coventry) Dealt with Aqeem and Kishan, this has been by far the best experience purchasing a car.

The whole experience was handled amazing I would highly recommend this site and Aqeem/Kishan's professionalism and hospitality. Definitely will keep in touch for the next upgrade."
2022-05-10,5,It was fab it was good
2022-05-10,5,"Traded in my Lexus RX for an ES300H at Lexus Guildford last week, I have dealt with several Lexus dealerships in the past but this was the best.

Paul sent me a video of the car then went on to send another one with the Rx Model side by side with the ES for me to compare dimensions without me asking for it to make sure I made the right choice, his priority was customer satisfaction rather than just securing a sale, very impressed, it showed dedication and passion about the brand and looking after his customers.

The Car is just amazing, the whole experience was the best I have ever had in a Lexus dealership.

Lexus Guildford are over an extra hours drive for me from my nearest dealer but I will take my car to them for servicing every year because they go above and beyond for there customers.

Well done Lexus Guildford and thank you for allowing me not only to experience an amazing car but also an amazing car purchase experience."
2022-05-09,1,"I bought an approved used vw in Nov.
Awful experience with sales person. Car mats were offered as part of purchase agreement to be collected from vw dealer closer to home. When I went to collect them I was told Manchester Inchcape had not honoured this.
Car interior filled with engine fumes until I called vw assist. The dipstick was missing.
Dipstick replacement and engine clean rectified by vw assist.
Supply of car mats still not addressed
Stay away from Manchester inchcape"
2022-05-09,5,Great service
2022-05-09,5,"Whilst I was waiting for my MOT I took the liberty of looking around other options for a trade in and Mark came out to help. I can safely admit out of all car sales personnel I’ve ever come across mark was the most attentive, understanding, patient and had a really calm demeanour he was not pushy went back and forth to get me all the information I needed to make a decision, which unfortunately was a no however this was no reflection on Mark’s professionalism and purely financial.

Also safe to say next time I am out in the market looking for an upgrade, I know whom I will be contacting. I felt extremely comfortable dealing with Mark he is a true asset to your organisation."
2022-05-06,5,"Having looked around at other dealerships for a suitable replacement for our Landrover Discover to have on PCP we came across the amazing MB GLB.

This was aided by the excellent service provided by Vassilis Christodoulou who did an excellent job of locating the vehicle we wanted and keep us informed of its arrival, preparing all the finance required and dealing with the purchase of our existing vehicle and the transfer of our private plate to the new vehicle.

All in all an excellent overall experience and we look forward to repeating this when we look to replace our car with another in the next few years."
2022-05-04,1,"This is my second purchase from new from the dealership but sadly I found the overall experience disappointing. (More detailed feedback has been communicated to their customer experience team).

More than anything I did not feel valued as a loyal customer. The lack of any post sale follow up courtesy call from the dealership has left me feeling underwhelmed."
2022-05-03,4,"After one of the salesman did not book the meeting in after a email enquiry followed by a chat on the phone when he called me , for me to arrive 3 days later at derby Toyota to find he’d booked the day off was not a good start,
However after Tom greeted us and apologised for the other salesman who was off and told me the wrong information we got round to looking at some cars and re arranged an appointment so I could have a test drive in which thanks to Tom I now own a Toyota car. What was a negative start at the dealership turned into a positive after the rest of the staff did a good job"

2022-04-30,5,"Booking was easy. Inspection carried out quickly and I received a call to say they could carry out the works that day. Later, I received a call to say work was complete and I collected. I do have a issue with the BMW inspection fee via a diagnostics check. There are few industries that charge you for an estimate when the repair cannot be carried out by third parties. If the work is being carried out on the same day, the inspection fee should be refunded."

2022-04-27,1,"Absolutely disgusting service from inchcape guildford. Purchased a range rover, it had a flat tyre on the day we collected it, were told it's because it's been sat for so long but if there were any issues they would sort it. Psi kept dropping so we were topping it up each week. Took it to the service centre twice and they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Had it checked at another garage to be told there was a screw in the tyre. Inchcape then said they would replace the tyre. They took the car for a day to replace the tyre, one week later we wrre topping the air up again. Took it to a garage today to be told the tyre was a 2016 tyre and had not been replaced. This is only one of the issues we have had and its a very long story. Everytime you call them, someone is supposed to call back but it never happens. We have spoken to so many people yet still have none of the issues resolved as no one gets back to us. We feel stressed and very disappointed. I have never known such bad service and would not recommend anyone spend their hard earned cash with this garage. They don't know the meaning of customer care."
2022-04-27,4,"Having received a shockingly rude and unhelpful service from Inchcape Guildford , who then mistakenly transferred me to Inchcape, Derby , it was a pleasurable experience to receive such helpful, polite service from Harvey Jellyman , Senior Service Advisor.
How refreshing to speak with someone who genuinely cared , was willing to help and went the extra mile. Guildford could learn a lot from Derby !
This is not the first time dealing with Guildford. Our first experience was last year when trying to purchase an F type Jaguar. The service was so bad that we ended up going to Droitwich to purchase our car. Ryan from Droitwich was amazing.
Pull your socks up Guildford !!"

2022-04-24,5,"I have just purchased a new E class from Mercedes’ Benz Nottingham. Phil the salesman was very friendly,pleasant and helpful, he made the whole experience stress free and easy.

I would recommend Phil and Mercedes Benz Nottingham to anyone wishing to purchase a car."
2022-04-23,1,"Absolutely Terrible people, purchased a car from Hyde Audi, Carl Cranham sold me an Audi s3, I paid the advertised price and confirmed multiple times that I had secured the car.
I paid a deposit and signed all the paperwork, to be told later that the price had changed and they were asking for another 5k on top off the price they had sold the car to me for.
DO NOT TRUST THESE JOKERS."
2022-04-22,1,Very bad and disappointed with their job they done to my car. Very unprofessional people
2022-04-21,1,"Very poor, appointment amended day before due to tyres not in stock, when I turned up to the rearranged appointment and all the tyres weren’t In stock so was expected to wait most the day, when I asked for a lift I got told no and wasn’t offered alternative options.
I still have no idea why the tyres were changed under the recall, I did mention that I had to change the tyres a while back not because they were low on tread but because the tyres had started to prematurely deteriorate.
I also now have continentals rather than Goodyear’s again not offered a choice.
To top it off one of my wheels now has a mark on it.
While it was in I Asked to inspect the fuel flap that was replaced under warranty at Mercedes Nottingham due to the poor fit and was advised that they could try and adjust but if it was to break while adjusting it then I would have to pay for the repair.
Certainly didn’t get that prestige feel and felt more of a Hindrance than a loyal Mercedes customer which car has full Mercedes history.
Very disappointed

This has never been followed up to rectify my complaint or as a minimum offer some reassurance.
Shocking!
Im glad you’re using my complaint to strive to deliver better customer service, shame it’s not directed to fix a dissatisfied loyal customer."
2022-04-20,1,"Worst experience ever- Burton Inchcape Toyota . Had spent 17k at this garage. Audi A5 had the parcel shelf missing which meant everything in boot was visible - they refused to replace. Was told car is 'sold as seen' then when I raised a complaint with trading standards, they reluctantly got me one from a breakers yard.
I also had cluth judder- i had a local mechanic look at it and was told its the dual mass fly wheel- they refused to admit the problem let alone repair.
I was lied to about the warranty- the salesman told me categorically I would get a replacement car if my csr ever went in for repair under warranty- that was only reason I bought the warranty - a complete lie from the the salesmen to mislead me into buying the warranty.
Basically this outfit sold me a defective car with missing parts , and lied to me about the warranty .
Terrible dealers. Worst experience ever. Stay away."
2022-04-19,1,"They left my 80 year old parents with no transport and a £6500 bill for repairs 2 days after a full service and mot, so much for paying thousands over the past 4 years on servicing, They are not to be trusted in any way with your loved and cared for cars. Car only done 48000 miles! Rubbish service and such bad customer service, just didn't care."
2022-04-19,1,"Terrible, placed a £99 reservation fee on a car in Cannock Bravo Auto which is part of Inchcape. It is fully refundable as stated on their website. However we decided we did not want the car, but to get this money refunded has been an absolute nightmare. First off refusing to refund the same way it was paid ie credit card, then making us sign further paperwork online, constant emails and calls and fake promises as to when we would get it. When the email eventually comes through, 14 days later to state we will get the refund, it says it can take 10 days. So that will be approx 24 days from requesting a refund to actually getting it. I would not now consider a car with these guys because they have proved their incompetence. And before anyone says Bravo Auto are not Inchcape, the refund email came from Inchcape...they are the puppeteers in charge...."
2022-04-19,1,Pathetic service and no email reply or response from repair estimator William Watkins at inchcape Toyota. I had my vehicle damage due to third-party collision. I have decided to take it inchcape Toyota Kidlington. Someone from service department taken photos of damaged vehicles and sent to repair estimator in order to give me a quote. In order to do this he taken longer time than expected for the response. Once i received the response i have asked for the door replacement and paint estimate quote. He taken more time for this also. But some of the photos missed out on the damaged vehicle. Therefore i have resent again a email. Since i have sent an there is no reply. And now it has been 2 weeks. This is such a pathetic service from repair estimator William Watkins at Toyota inchcape head office. I am extremely frustrated for the inconvenience is causing. I have filed a complaint i will wait for the response.

2022-04-15,1,", just wanted to let you know about my customer service over the last 2 days , I called up on the 6th and asked if I could drop my car off that evening as we did when you sorted out my tyres .
I was told to call back at 4 o’clock to see if there was a car for me , which I did and was told that Josh would call me back which didn’t happen.
So I took my car in at 8:30 on the 7th and got to work at 9:30 hour and a half late for work so I lost money for that hour and a half .
I didn’t get a call from from Josh or any one from BMW all day to tell me my car was ready, at 4;30 I called to see what was going on to be told my car wasn’t on the system and I was put on hold and eventually cut off so in the end I drove to Bmw hoping my car would be ready it wasn’t even on the forecourt.
I did get my car in the end but I’m not happy with the service I got from BMW …

2022-04-13,1,"Recently had a service. Inchcape Derby Health check pointed out a number of items which were “dangerous and need fixing straight away”. Failing MOT on one item only, rear brake pipes £700( 175/hr). Agreed to have done, leave other items. Had to be returned to have brakes Re led two days later. One week later oil leaking on resin drive and strong smell of burning oil. Car taken to independent LR service provider who confirmed oil filter had been fitted wrong leaving me with oil on the drive and a smelly car and another bill.
Offered coffee five times. Don’t need coffee or valet, just good car servicing!!"

Had to look for my car everywhere and no one even bothered to show where it is. Shocking, never received such a poor service. Now I hear some kind or rattling noise when driving, asked for manager to call me back and no one did as of yet.. Just shocking, if my staff would treat my customers in that way I would sack them all. I hope this is not Inchcape UK standard practice and it was just a hiccup?"
2022-04-11,5,Car went in to deal with a recall. Staff were courteous and made the process easy and straightforward. Was provided with a courtesy car and completed service early to allow me to attend parents evening. Overall Fantastic experience.

Phil is a credit to the company as are the 2 ladies at the front reception. We have bought 2 cars so far from Mercedes’ and we can’t recommend them enough. Even the after sale and service is fantastic!! Many thanks

2022-04-06,3,"*** The garage has now refunded my repair ***

Unneeded and costly repair that didn't fix the issue. Went into Toyota Inchcape as my car had started to make a low rumble/humming sound when driving over 50mph.

Long story short, they told me it needed a new Cat Converter (despite the current one only being 2 years old) at the cost of nearly £1400. Got the car back - guess what. Noise still present and getting progressively worse.

Took it back 3 times for this fault to be diagnosed (£50.40) properly. Was told it was a rusted Exhaust part (nope). Got told it was ball bearings (nope) Finally they said it was a differential baring in the gearbox - nothing to do with the brand new Cat Converter that they said was the issue.

So I have a car with a new unneeded, misdiagnosed and mis-sold £1400 repair that it did not need. The garage offered £465 refund! But has not made good on this, or messaged me back with a more realistic refund offer.

Very very disappointing."
2022-04-04,5,"Having had to arrange an emergency appointment with Inchcape Bury this morning, I could not thank them enough, they could not do enough for me.
After getting me an apt at such short notice, when i got there they were so helpful, they arranged a desk for me to work from with a powerpoint for my laptop, and got me a coffee, they constantly asked if i needed anything or wanted another drink whilst i waited for my car to be repaired, the customer service at this particular branch was fantastic and i would highly recommend them."
2022-04-04,5,"Very helpful, great staff and happy with overall customer service"
2022-04-01,1,"Where do you start when describing the dreadful service that you’ll receive from Inchcape in Kings Lynn?

It’s clear to see why they had their Landrover main dealer status taken away from them.

Be prepared to have to call them daily if your car is having work done and then be prepared for the lack of knowledge from their “mechanics” and the lies from their service manager.

I started my ordeal with Inchcape in Kings Lynn on the 21st October 2021 and didn’t get my car back until the 9th of February 2022. The car came out of their dealership with more faults than it went in with.

In the end I had to get another garage to fix all the problems they had caused.

Please, please, please don’t get caught by this bunch of cowboys like I did. I knew they were useless, but with the simple job it was booked in for and with them being the closest dealership to me i still booked my car in with them and what a mistake that turned out to be."
2022-04-01,2,"Carl was a great person to deal with.
However the car was filthy, even after I insisted on a good clean and pointed out the issues.
Also I am glad I viewed the car in person as it was nothing like how they described it to me over the phone .
When spending over £110k - you expect a clean car and not the rubbish and stains from the previous keeper to still be on there"
2022-03-30,5,very happy with the service becky toal provided us.
2022-03-30,5,"Great customer service , from the team . Sales person becca is very helpful and knowledgeable in everything to do relating to mercedes. I will continue to use this mercedes dealership instead of my previous dealership."
2022-03-30,5,The car collection facility was used for our car to be serviced. Excellent.
2022-03-29,5,"They are Brilliant!
I took in my tired old 2015 XJL for its 128,000 mile service and to investigate a nasty vibration and shake as I went round roundabouts.
A couple of days later, and for a lot less than I was expecting, they returned my beautiful big cat - restored to all of it’s £97k+ brand new glory - as good as, if not better than, new!
The smile is back on my face, the magic carpet ride is back from my XJ and I remain the happiest of customers! Even diagnosing wheel bearing problems can be tricky yet they got to the bottom of the car’s issues quickly efficiently and for less than expected - what is not to love!
Thank you Inchcape Jaguar Norwich for giving me my car back in such superb shape
Cannot recommend highly enough!"
2022-03-29,1,"Does not recommend.

- [ ] Paid £100 to reserve a car online on Monday 7th March. Waited until 4pm the next day when I had to phone up to see what happened next, only to be told the car had been sold the previous day.
- [ ] I was advised they could still get me a similar car and my deposit was transferred to a car they could get in from a different inchcape. Saw photos and was told it was on its way.
- [ ] Had a phone call on Friday 11th March to advise the car was no longer available. Requested for my money to refunded ASAP but would be happy for them to still search for cars in this range. I was told my refund would reach me in 3-5 working days.
- [ ] I had no contact from them after this whatsoever.
- [ ] I sent two emails, two phone calls with promises to call me back and got nowhere.
- [ ] Spoke to the reception and they advised 7-10 days for a refund but this has also passed.
- [ ] This was passed to the manager who advised the salesman had left for the day on Friday 25th and would get back to me first thing Monday morning. Again, no phone call arrived and I had to chase again for an answer as I was now on the 11th working day.
- [ ] Within this phone call I believe I was lied to by the salesman who advised he didn’t get back to me via email as he was on annual leave however the receptionist and the manager failed to tell me this when I rang the week before?
- [ ] I was subsequently told that my refund hadn’t been processed because the person who needed to sign it off was on annual leave. This is completely not good enough getting told this on the 11th working day.

This is completely not a good enough service. Again, I told inchcape that I would only post my review if I hadn’t got an answer as to if my refund was processed today. But as above the same standard of service, this commutation hasn’t come no contact.

I have paid £100 for a car that was already sold, got transferred to another car that was never available and I’m still having to chase a refund when they’ve had my money for nearly a month."
2022-03-29,5,Great dealership with good access and a very friendly team. I would 100% use them again.
2022-03-29,2,"I bought a used Rav4 from Inchcape Oxford on 25th March. Sales process was smooth, David Groves was courteous and professional, like all salesmen. Computer systems were acting up and I was provided a quote with a price more than £2000 higher than that on the website. I had to ask to get it corrected. After that, the reservation fee was missed in calculations, which again I had to ask for correction.
The experience after that was not the best either. I had to wait for almost 90 mins to pick the vehicle. Vehicle tax was not paid online because it required a change of user class from 'disabled' to 'alternative fuel'. This could have been checked in advance by the salesman. The next day, I discovered that the aircon was not working. A dashcam was removed from the windshield but the sticky tape was not taken away cleanly, even after my very specific instructions. And the service log book was missing. I had to follow up for 4 days to reach a resolution. Minor issues, everything could have been addressed in advance with some diligence by the sales team or service team. Overall, I am pretty disappointed and have lost trust in this dealership and the service team. I am not confident if the electrical and mechanical checks were carried out at all. I have the feeling that customer satisfaction is not a priority at Inchcape Oxford. I would try to avoid any future business and would advise my contacts to do the same."
2022-03-29,5,"I recently purchased a used car (Skoda) from Inchcape Swindon. I had an after sales issue which was resolved promptly by Adrian the Sales Manager. He gave excellent customer service and made sure the issue was resolved to my satisfaction.
I left extremely satisfied with his intervention & will return in the future."
2022-03-29,5,Overall Excellent high quality service
2022-03-28,5,Excellent service.
2022-03-28,5,"Again, a very high quality mot transaction- where an intermittent engine light was rectified all under warranty - informed through whole process, and a video of the underneath of the car etc sent to me with explanation that all factors were fine. The car was even cleaned thoroughly, to that I am embarrassed, as it was a state! Thank you so much"
2022-03-28,1,"Since the new dealership was opened I have had nothing but the best service from Mercedes’ Cheshire oaks. Last Friday I took my CLA shooting brake in for some annoying small issues. Greeted by a service receptionist who clearly was in a rush, very dismissive attitude and clearly gave me the impression she had more important things to be doing. Accepted she brought round the loan car for me this I really appreciated as I’m disabled so walking around the site t find the loan car would have been very difficult.
I returned later to collect my car and return the loan car. Same service reception Person who stated all jobs had been carried out and the car valeted for me. Here’s your keys and was off and gone!!!! My car is where please??? No chance of even being able to ask that question. Fortunately I parked the loan car right next to my car on my return.
The salesman who I have dealt with on 3 new cars walked past and said a very brief hello and when I asked a question just said sorry I’m busy and was gone.
I left the dealership, collected my car and returned home. On checking the kick to open facility on the tailgate this did not work. This worked perfectly and has done since purchasing this new car in September 21. I phoned the dealership. After waiting 15 minutes for the service option to respond an operator connected and kindly took my details of the problem and said the service receptionist would call me back before close of business Friday. It’s now Monday and I’ve heard nothing. Not that I expected to as it seems those in sales and service have more important matters to deal with than customers.
The car was valeted perfectly I must say.
I’m a Motabilty customer. I’ve also been in Sales all my working life and have never ever treated any customer the way I was treated on Friday. I am so close to leaving this dealership and going elsewhere. Since covid restrictions have been lifted the attitude of some personal to customer service has become extremely poor. To a disabled customer it’s offensive.
I would say however that the showroom receptionist are outstanding and their offer to bring coffee to where I was seated was very kind and thoughtful. Sharpen up Mercedes’ Cheshire oaks or I for one will be going elsewhere for future services and new vehicles."
2022-03-28,4,"I had a great experience at Chelmsford Mini where the service was friendly, efficient and very knowledgeable."
2022-03-28,1,I purchased my car on the 14th of March less than two hours later there was faults with it in the back it was not cleaned properly and dirty my glove box won’t close my screen in my dashboard comes up with lines in the and a fault saying to contact the dealer my back wiper is squeaking because it needed changing and my car when I drive it makes a clunking noise whenever stopping moving or reversing I have contacted the dealers about these issues who have told me to bring the car in and they’d get the engineer to look at the the engineer said there was nothing he could do with the glove compartment as the magnetic strip had gone and wasn’t even able to seal it so it wasn’t in the way to where my sister who is 5 was getting in the car and the corner of the glove compartment caught her and scratched her the mats in the car and a big tear in them and I was told my car needed booking in to get repaired although i had it less than 3 days with all these faults and problems I called the dealers to book my car in I got no response no communication whenever I rang up to find out or to speak to anyone they wasn’t available or would ring me back which I never received if anyone is thinking of purchasing a Volkswagen I would not recommend this one me personally when I go to upgrade my car in the future I will not be returning to the stockport one as this experience is stressful and I feel like I’ve been flogged off.
2022-03-24,3,"There is a friction noise coming from the front when I turn the steering wheel full right after having picked up the car which certainly wasn't there before. The fault code was never cleared (after charging me about 600 pounds for a glow plug replacement) it was still showing as a fault in the system. Charging for almost 2k for the repair and not even bothering to clear the fault which I had to pay extra to do myself, had to take the car to a local garage because Inchape wouldn't return my calls. What do I find out there? Well apparently the C-links for the anti-rollbar was either the wrong part or fitted wrong which was also the reason of the friction noise coming as it was sticking out excessively and rubbing against the front off site tire (which was again fitted as new by them) when the steering wheel was fully turned to the right. I have been using this car for more than a week now without knowing the danger at 80 miles an hour. How can you even miss that? Taking pictures of it and emailed to them that clearly shows the stellar! job they've done and as of now still no resolution. Just stay away from them at all costs. Horrible service experience,

Update 06/09/2022

After some emails back and forth they have (finally) accepted that the part was fitted in the wrong way. Again after some emails back and forth they have compensated the situation (which didn't happen as a natural response hence 3 stars). Had to pull some strings to get them to do the common sense."
2022-03-24,5,"I took our car in for a health check at the Burton branch today and was really impressed with the service I received. Professional, friendly and efficient. This is our first Toyota and we are so thrilled with everything, the car and also the after sales service from our local branch. Out of all the cars we have had in the past, this is by far the best and we will definitely be recommending them to our friends and family."
2022-03-23,5,Excellent service. Very efficient and courteous. Useful report on the condition of the car.
2022-03-21,5,"Service reception staff friendly, helpful,
Fault on the car was repaired, I asked I’d driver side side light could be changed as not working this was not done"
2022-03-21,1,"Went in to purchase an A5 for cash but was intercepted by a finance sales person who persuaded me to take half the purchase price on finance in return for two free services.
I explained that I did not want any kind of lease scheme with ballon payments mileage restriction etc and he proceeded to sign me up on just such a contract.
When this came to light at the end of the contract I complained in writing to the sales manager at Inchcape Audi Cheshire Oaks but did not receive any reply. I subsequently filed a complaint with the financial ombudsman but this was rejected.
The salesman lied to my face and, although I have always bought Audi cars and I like them, having had this experience I can never buy another. Very sad."
2022-03-18,5,"Car booked in for MOT and service. Collected on time. Good communication throughout from dealership. Car returned on time, cleaned and valeted. Happy with overall service as usual."
2022-03-17,2,"I called the day before to enquire about the loan car I was going to receive I was told it wasn’t going to be the car on the day and that they would give me something close to my car. I drive an A1 I was given an A4. Everything was fine with my service and happy with the service received from Barry on the day. However, I also opted in for a wash n vac, I then emailed Barry the next day to enquire about this service and have no received a reply. I am still waiting it’s safe to say when my service plan is up I will be cancelling and no longer going to Audi. for a company of your standard the wash n vac (which may of been complementary) did not live up to your company standard. I brought new car mats to change once my car has received the vac and the mats themselves were hoovered but underneath was still covered in mud this is just pure laziness and not something I expected from Audi. I then spent my evening after getting home from the dealership around half 6 (I left work at 3:45 which is only down the road and was left waiting for atleast 30mins-45mins to be given my keys and told everything was fine which I received an email to confirm this anyway!) I then had to re vacuum my whole car and polish all inside as this wasn’t done. I’m really not happy and if this was a complementary service this gives me no hope that the work completed in my service was actually up to the standard I would expect from Audi If you can’t even do something that isn’t included in my service plan and is offered free to your customers does not live up to the standards you set yourself as a company.

2022-03-17,1,"Audi Inchcape Tetbury : AVOID!

Audi Tetbury Quercus Rd Tetbury GL8 8GX
Reg/d Office: Inchcape Retail Ltd Unit 3140 Park Square Birmingham B37 7YN

WARNING! We were deceived and lied to by this company. We booked our Audi Q7 in for a service, an MOT and to have 2 seat belts replaced. Alexandra Fudge, in the Service department told my wife, Kirsty over the phone that the brake pads also needed replacing, 1 rubber bush and a single section of plastic felt undercarriage. She told Alex to go ahead and replace all of those parts, being the only things they had told us was wrong with the car. We were told the seat belts would be approx. £330, plus MOT at a usual cost, 4 break pads, undercarriage and a 'bush' and we thought would come to no more than £1k max. My wife collected the car today from Alex with a total bill of just under £5,000. They had not replaced the brake pads but the brake discs as well. And a whole load of other things we had never asked for. Alex Fudge said she had an email from us where we had ticked everything. Kirsty asked her for the email. Alex said she could not find it. Alex said she was 'surprised' that Kirsty had 'ticked' all the long list of other things that also needed replacing or repairing. Alex said she wouldn't know where to find the email and brushed away the conversation. There is a simple reason: neither Kirsty or myself emailed her. She lied to us. Appalling."
2022-03-16,5,"At a time when supply of parts is almost impossible, so the building and supplying of vehicles is clearly difficult. However I cannot praise enough the communication, honesty, helpfulness from this dealership.

Sam the business manager has delivered exceptional service through out. I have total trust and belief for any requirements moving forward due positive approach to any assistance I had needed and a fantastic integrity in how all business was conducted.

well done and thank you all.

p.s The car pretty amazing too!!"
2022-03-15,1,"Took 4 attempts to get car booked in for repair (Replace a door mirror), details were taken and was told someone would ring back with quote and to make an appointment but never got called back. Had to ask to speak to management to finally get an appointment.
On day of appointment was agreed I could wait for car to be repaired but after an hr and 20 mins wait was told the part they had was broken and they would need to send to Chester to get new one (I was in Preston). Visit aborted and new appointment made.
Was told Inchcape would pick up car from my home to do the repair due to me being inconvenienced (On previous visits Inchcape had refused to do this, despite telling me when I bought the car that they would pick up from my home in Blackpool). Few days later got an email from Inchcape to say appointment made and I was expected to bring car to Preston dealership at 08:00. Inchcape did though call a few days later and confirm they would pick the car up from my home (problem with Generic email!). Vehicle was then finally repaired to my satisfaction."
2022-03-15,5,Very informative staff who made the purchase very easy
2022-03-15,5,"Brilliant customer service, I feel they went above and beyond of what I was expecting. Special thanks to Pablo."
2022-03-15,2,"I was most disappointed and my expectations were not met. My car was in all day and the time lines for work to be carried out resulted in me being contacted rather late in the day hence, I could not get back in time and had to collect the car the next car. No apparent fault was found which was pleasing however, a goodwill gesture could have been to charge the car for me. Particularly as it was indicated that I was not charging the car enough. I would like to point out I rang to get an estimated time for completion but this could not be given. I sat in Costa (Kidlington) for several hours before going into Oxford.
Also I had to complete the interview form, which took 5 minutes however, I waited around 25 minutes for agent to finish on another call. The attention should have been focused on dealing with my appointment. I arrived at 10.15am as booked and left the dealership at 11am."
2022-03-14,5,"Georgia was very helpful and professional, she took care of all our queries patiently. Great experience, keep up the good work !!

2022-03-14,5,Great service as always
2022-03-12,1,"Took car for MOT & Service

They did Service before MOT only to then identify MOT FAILURE (backwards).

They called to tell me but couldn’t tell me when they rang how much works would cost which frankly is stupid!

When they called back nearly an hour later I was initially quoted £1650 worth of works, I argued it and you reduced to £1250. I was disgusted and went to an established well known garage group who were able to complete works for £550 and were far more friendly and personable.

You’re excessively expensive and after having a very poor experience with you last year you have now exhibited a similar below par experience this year. Will not use again and will definitely not purchase a car from Inchcape in the future. If Jaguar/Land Rover has any sense they should remove their franchise arrangement with you immediately before you do them more reputation damage.

Update: Got car back from the other garage on Tuesday who also completed its MOT. When they thoroughly checked the car over they found that there was no such damage to the upper ball joints as claimed by INCHCAPE JAGUAR DERBY and that in fact they were perfectly fine, despite me being advised by INCHCAPE JAGUAR DERBY that my car was dangerous to drive. My car sailed through the MOT with no works being required with just 2 small advisories which were both tyre related. The other garage showed complete decency and honesty as they could have carried out the works and collected their quoted £550 payment as they had already gone to the trouble to get the parts in and I would have been none the wiser, however they're approach was we only ever charge for works that are actually needed and showed complete honesty and integrity. So based on this experience it seems INCHCAPE JAGUAR DERBY were trying to charge me £1650 for works that were not actually required, no wonder they were quick to drop the price by £400 when I challenged them. I have to ask the question just how many other people are they doing this to and I can only assume these directions to charge customers for non required works is coming from management. I would advise everyone to AVOID THIS GARAGE for servicing as they clearly can't be trusted if they are exhibiting this sort of behaviour to their customers. To say I am shocked and disgusted by this is a total understatement. I have been having my service completed by them for the last 8 years, both at the previous location and since they moved to their more swanky facility and now I have to ask myself how many more times I may have been misled by them and their apparently fraudulent conduct and behaviour."
2022-03-12,5,"Our experience at Land Rover was positive. From our first contact Remy was extremely helpful and allowed us to look without being pushy.
He was knowledgeable and went out of his way to accommodate our budget and find the right car. He was also a great help with changing over our documents made the collection special for our 2 little boys."
2022-03-11,4,"Lauren was helpful and friendly, facilitating the sale of a second hand car well. She offered to help me with queastions following the sale but some of my queries remain unanswered"
2022-03-10,1,"I would not recommend this garage. Viewed a 2013 car and was given reassurances about the service history, warranty and it would be checked over with MOT etc - everything you want to hear. On purchasing the car they didn't have any paperwork on service history or MOTs and the salesman hadn't found out if the cam belt had been replaced as promised. The oil marker was high but I was told this was normal for a petrol car. The 150 point inspection is a joke. When I got home I found a loose rear lens, broken coil spring and rust under to front tray. When I rang up I was told I was mistaken. They eventually agreed to see it and replaced the coil spring and tightened the lens. The touching up of paintwork was poor quality."
2022-03-10,5,Staff or always friendly on arrival. Advisers and Technicians listen to the problems reported and deal with them professionally on every occasion. No complaints on all my visits to date.
2022-03-09,5,Great experience taken care of from the minute I walked in. That’s why I buy Toyota every time.
2022-03-08,1,"I recently bought a used Jaguar F-Pace from Inchcape Jaguar in Preston.
Nice shiny dealership full of very shiny people. arrived from Bristol on a Friday afternoon to pick up what I was assured an A1 F-Pace as ""only a Jaguar dealership would sell"" .
By the time they got around to handing the car over to me it was dark.
Liked the car, good drive home, however next day in the daylight it became obvious the Car was nowhere near A1 condition! Stone chips all over the front of the car, damaged and broken trim inside the car.
I complained to the sales person who handled the transaction, was asked to send photos to indicate the damage, since then, no response, not even a single answer to my numerous requests to deal with the situation. I would never use them again, ruined the buying experience for me. Avoid."
2022-03-08,5,"Great experience. Made to feel welcome and requirements were understood and the sales executive; Aaron, clearly described the appropriate product to meet my needs. Following a brief discussion to confirm all the details, a deal was made and new vehicle bought. The car was delivered quicker than expected , and when collected I was made to feel important. Great service and will return in future for my next vehicle."
2022-03-08,5,"Smooth, efficient and friendly throughout"
2022-03-07,1,"Avoid this place. Was sold a car three weeks ago on the basis of a video sent. Picked up car and it immediately had something wrong with it due to a noise from the rear. Took it back and was told it was moisture oh and the suspension been lowered. None of this was mentioned in the video. Further damage to the car in the way of a smashed lower front grille and interior roof lining coming away (previous owner must have ran wiring through it!) none mentioned in video. Car was supposedly fixed, loud noise came back that night. Took car back, by time I got to showroom (100 miles away) noise has gone. They won’t refund as they can’t find the fault. Was promised a call from Andy at the showroom last week, nothing so far. Really disappointed and tbh shocking way to run a business."
2022-03-07,1,"After travelling 4.5 hours to collect a car from Inchcape which was described as 'immaculate' by Inchape Wirral, I was extremely disappointed to find the car in a very different description than described.

It had a number of scratches and scuffs which were not picked up by the video sent to us by the salesman Tyler, including 3 extremely scuffed alloy wheels.

With the condition being a long way from described, the used sales manager Liam offered to pay for a company local to my house to repair all alloys, and send us 3 new centre caps that were missing. Without this offer, we would have walked away from the deal.

3 months later, Inchape have taken to ignoring all means of contact without even sending out the centre caps, nevermind repairing all the damage that was supposed to be corrected.

Stay well away from Inchape. They do not deserve to represent the VW brand."

2022-03-07,2,"I initially booked my car in for a repair at Mercedes of Southport but received a phone call the day before telling me that they could no longer honour this and asked if I would be happy moving it to the following week. When my car went in I was given a courtesy car which was very dirty inside and had literally just enough fuel in to get me to the nearest petrol station. I was expecting my car to be repaired and serviced the same day but received a phone call at around 5:30pm to tell me it would be the following day. I received no phone call the following day. The day after that I received a phone call to tell me my car was ready. When I went to pick it up I was not seen by a member of the service team, a man from the garage side came into the showroom and handed me my key then walked off. My car had not been washed or vacuumed and I was given no explanation of what work was carried out. I will not use Mercedes of Southport again"
2022-03-05,5,Sold my 2020 Tiguan to Inchcape Retail UK. A very good representative contacted me and helped me to go through the process on line. The representative is helpful and very responsive. Something quick and easy.
2022-03-04,1,"I was there to service my car today and the experience at Inchcape Reading was abysmal. They promised a fast track service which means the car will be ready in 90 minutes while you wait at the retail store. However it took me 170 minutes. This is even after my wife told them and specifically requested them that we need the car back by certain time since we need to be out for school pick up. There was zero regard to customer request. Lazy, ignorant staff who don’t care about the customer experience. BMW Cooper use to be so much better. Certainly not coming back here again."
2022-03-04,5,Excellent service
2022-03-04,5,Brilliant looked after really well
2022-03-04,1,"Booked an express 1 hour service. On arrival at the dealership, I handed my keys to the receptionist and advised that I would be waiting in the dealership, given the type of service booked - express 1 hour service. I was directed to the lounge / waiting area. After an hour, no update on my service completion had been received. After a further 50 minutes, I had still not received any update and so I went to speak with the receptionist, as I had been waiting for nearly 2 hours. Shortly after this, a service department colleague came over to me. I was handed an envelope and directed to leave, with an explanation being given of where my vehicle had been parked. I received no apology for the prolonged wait, no explanation of the vehicle status following the service and no explanation of the work carried out. I explained that I was very unhappy that I had been waiting for 2 hours - the adviser simply said she did not know I had been waiting - again no apology was received. I left the dealership extremely disappointed with the level of customer service received, especially after attending the dealership where I had purchased a number of new Mercedes vehicles from over previous years. I had heard from other customers that the service from Mercedes-Benz was below the expected standards, however from previous experience, I had always received great service. On this occasion however, it appears my experience was falling in with the experiences of other customers. Very disappointed with the overall experience at Mercedes-Benz of Cheshire Oaks."
2022-03-03,5,"Second to none service, highly recommended."
2022-03-03,5,"Recently bought a new car and couldn’t be more happier with the service I received totally professional and efficient from start to finish albeit one little blip but that was explained and sorted by the sales rep Mr Paul Robinson who dealt with me throughout the whole transition. 5* plus rating from me.
Many thanks."
2022-03-01,5,"Superbly organised, wholly professional and courtesy car lovely. Service fantastic and helped with video summary to show any advisories. Bill clearly presented and accurate. Inchcape are a premium Retailer that deserves the high praise"
2022-03-01,5,Absolutely brilliant service from Paul Robinson. Felt really looked after by all the team we interacted with but Paul wasn't pushy at all and really helped us get a great deal. We had been to Audi in Warrington previous and the level of service was like night and day. Your loss Audi! Definite Mercedes convert now and the car is great
2022-03-01,1,The car was not checked thoroughly before hang it over to me.
2022-02-28,5,"Service has been completed and carried out in agreed time. All stuff were professional and polite. Perhaps only thing, would be to improve curtesy car availability"
2022-02-27,5,"From first contact to handover, the sales executive was knowledgeable, informative and attentive, making the whole experience fantastic, probably the best in the 40 years I have had a Land Rover - very well done!"
2022-02-27,1,"Bought an ex demo Audi RS5 from them last year. The salesman (George) was a credit to the business and the initial purchase went smoothly. My review in particular is in reference to their aftersales service. They had carried out a recall on the rear axel and had not alligned the rear wheels afterwards. This caused the rear tyres to wear down excessively. Mistakes happen, however, when their solution is to leave a customer without a car for 10 days while they argue back a forth as to who is at fault this is simply not acceptable. I ended up contacting Audi UK and it eventually got sorted it out. Charlotte their after sales manager was constantly lying to me regarding the situation. I will never use Inchcape Audi again and would not recommend based on my experience. I should note that mine was a long distance purchase, however, I don’t think that is an excuse for the shockingly bad after sales service I received."
2022-02-26,1,"Walked into Inchcape VW Telford this morning with my family and a fist full of dollars.
Really wanted to buy a new car today and was looking forward to it.
Walked around the pitch and showroom for at least 20 minutes. No one talked to us. The was no one to ask anything. Not like it was busy in there. 2 people in sales by the looks of it. Both of them had customers with them.
This was a lost sale for you Inchcape. Won’t be coming back. Will go elsewhere where they show some interest. I also saw another family walk out for the same reason.
They say car dealers are struggling with long lead times on new cars, but if they all act like this, they are getting what they deserve"
2022-02-25,4,"The car drop off and collection of the courtesy car was excellent and smooth. I managed to drive the new EQA and I may now consider an EQC in the near future.

The technician (Jason) called me re a repair we had already discussed and installed as required which was spot on and checked the battery because of strange start/stop behaviour.

I was at 5 stars at this point.

Got a text to collect my car, so headed to the Branch and then waited for greater than 45 mins to be seen because of a conference call being held and only my intervention asking Sophie for help moved it on. Don’t text me and say to collect if you’re not ready for my arrival or handover the management of the task whilst unavailable.

Also, asked for a dent to be looked at, and for the second time it was not looked at. I have been told it’s a simple task, if so, show me how simple and I’ll do it!

These two issue dropped to 4 star.

Car left clean, working, etc etc so no major problems."
2022-02-25,5,Annual service and MOT carried out by MB Oxford for the last 9 years. I was happy with the level of service from all staff and the also the use of a courtesy car. Agreed to renew my service contract for another 3 years. All was Great. My 4th Merc and no plans to change.
2022-02-24,5,Excellent service.
2022-02-24,1,"Please do not ever use the Liverpool inchcape dealership.
Bought a used e class, under 3 years old approx 20k mileage. However was told via video, email and in pictures that the car had Burmester sound system. On delivery of the car it was only fake after market Burmester covers stuck on with blue tak. Also car was so dirty. Debris under both front seats. Covers missing from isofix fittings on rear seat. Rust on amg signs. Cust on rear door cards. None of these were visible on the clever videos and pictures sent before hand. Complained straight away and sent pictures. Sales person apologised but said we needed to speak to the sales manager who was absolutely useless. Not what you would expect from a ‘Mercedes’ garage. Lie after lies! After many emails and calls they agreed to get the car fixed at our local Mercedes’ garage in London. When they got the quote for the work, they stopped responding to the London Mercedes’ garage to authorise the work.
Finally we received an email and they are saying they won’t cover all the work as it is over £3000. Even the London Mercedes garage has said the car should not have been sold in that condition. We have given up on inchcape Liverpool and have stopped begging them to put things right. Please do not deal with henry or paul darch- manager of the dealership who hasn’t even responded once."

2022-02-21,5,"My first service visit to the Ipswich dealership. Easy online booking. Received a courtesy call from them the day before. Polite, friendly and efficient service, the online check-in saves time. Costs quoted up front, no hidden extras. Car returned nicely washed and polished."
2022-02-21,5,Easy and convenient
2022-02-21,5,"Just bought my second car from them, an EV this time.
Have always been very welcome at Inchcape, the staff are friendly and the sales staff know what they are talking about."
2022-02-18,1,"Car booked in as the lower section of the drivers heated seat wasn't working. Car dropped off at 8am and no update received as to how the repair was proceeding . At 5pm I rang the garage who confirmed the repair had been fixed and the paperwork was just all being completed and that the car was ready for collection.
Arrived at the garage and had to wait about 15 minutes for the car t one brought from the rear. No paperwork or any details of the work carried out was given.
On the way back home we tried the heated seat and much to my disappointment the lower section of the drivers seat was still not getting hot.
I telephoned the garage and have had to rebook it in for just over a weeks time to try and fix the seat. Meaning more time off work and more expense taking it to the garage.
I did think it a bit strange that no paperwork or update about the fault was given, so I do query whether anybody actually looked at the fault the car was in for.
Very disappointed with the service given."
2022-02-18,5,Very friendly services
2022-02-18,5,"The service provided by Audi Macclesfield is excellent from all departments they will after you as soon as you walk through the door even in Covid times nothing is not to much trouble they even dropped of in town they informed me that the had been service and washed ready for pick up. And the cost is cheaper than any ford garage? I definitely be purchasing another car through Audi Macclesfield they really look after you nothing is to much for them, we purchase an Audi Q2 Sline tfsi black edition march 2020."

The quote for a new battery replacement was One Hundred Pound above a local BMW specialist garage.
I declined their quote for a replacement battery and saved the cost amount of their soft ware I drive update."
2022-02-15,1,"The checking done by mechanics at Inchcape Toyota Nottingham is great and professional with videos and report. However, the most annoying is they charged me for the checking fee though my car is within their warranty period. I have called several times to contact the Customer Service Rep to enquire about such but failed. They didn‘t return my call either. How frustrating and time wasting it is!"
2022-02-15,5,Great service as always at Lexus Derby. Chloe always helpful in the service department. That's why I am now driving my fourth car from them.

2022-02-15,1,"No Refund, No Reason, No Response.

I rang VW about a used vehicle on Monday 8th Feb. I had my car valued on line and was offered ~£17400. On arrival at site I was met by Chris who was very friendly and showed me the vehicle. The vehicle had a number of marks including being keyed down the passenger side and a dent in the drivers door and badly curbed alloys. These issues were discussed with Chris and agreed to be looked at. I was then offered £16500 for my vehicle even though it met the requirements of the online valuation. This valuation was then returned to £17400 after discussion with the provision that I paid for £500 for dent and scratch cover.

Chris then said to think about it overnight and to leave a holding deposit to ensure that no-one else could buy the vehicle. I stated that I wanted to inspect the repairs before proceeding with the sale. This was agreed and stated when I paid the holding deposit.

The next day (08/02) I stated I categorically did not want the dent and scratch cover and was then offered £17000 part ex value for mine without buying the cover.

I argued this as my vehicle met the original online valuation and in the end Chris agreed that the £17400 part ex.

I was told that a document would be sent through for me to sign. I stated to Chris that we had agreed I would not sign anything until I had seen the repair work on the vehicle.

I also asked at this point about the Service history and it was found the vehicle needed a service. I asked about the Cambelt and was told it was due at 80k. I checked this and found that the cambelt was due at 5 years. This would have been the beginning of March 22 i.e in just over 2 weeks. I asked about this and was told it would not be completed. This is obviously a costly service (£300-400) and would have been needed to ensure I kept within the warranty requirements of the Inchcape used warranty terms and conditions and this within 2 weeks of the proposed vehicle purchase. If I had not completed the cambelt change and it failed within the year Inchcape could have refused any repair work as the recommended service intervals had not been kept as per the manufacturers guidelines.

I was then called on Thurs and told that the car had had its checks completed, an Mot and a tyre had been replaced. I was told this was not needed but done out of courtesy. This tyre was under 3mm and therefore had to be replaced as part of the Inchcape Used Vehicle promise. I was told it was done as a good will gesture. The MOT was also a requirement of this as there was less than 9 months remaining. I was told that all of the above was done as a courtesy to me purchasing the vehicle. I was then told that the repairs had been carried out and I could view the vehicle. I agreed I could come out of hours and inspect the vehicle if it could be parked at the front. This was agreed and Chris kindly put the vehicle out.

At this point I had still not seen the repair and had not confirmed I was moving forward with the sale. I inspected the vehicle on Thurs (10/02) night. Although improved I was not happy with the repairs and coupled with the fact that I was going to have to pay for a cambelt straight away I decided I was not going to move forward with the sale.

Unfortunately I did not get the opportunity to contact Chris until later on Fri (11/02) to confirm I was not moving forward with the sale and asked for my holding deposit to be refunded. In this email Chris stated that other people were after the vehicle so I let him know I was not moving forward with the sale asap.

I received an email on Sat (12/02) from Chris and in short was told I would unfortunately not receive a refund of my holding deposit. There was no reason for this.

I have replied to this twice without any response from Chris asking how they can not refund a holding deposit. I stated I wanted to be happy with the vehicle condition and on top of that the cambelt issue was a concern that led to the decision to not purchase the vehicle.

I do not like writing bad review as Chris was a nice guy. However this is my hard earned money during a difficult time and a company such as Inchcape cannot offer a reason for not refunding a holding deposit of £250. This will be passed to the Motor Ombudsmen and I will be seeking further legal guidance.

I have purchesed vehicles from Inchcape in the past but for the sake of £250 they have now lost a customer for life, and I cannot recommend them."
2022-02-14,5,"Clean, professional showroom with plenty of facilities for customer comfort and safety. Sales team are knowledgeable and friendly."
2022-02-14,5,Great company to deal with
2022-02-14,5,They were very helpful and give me very good service
2022-02-14,1,"Unfortunatley not a great experience from Inchcape. Having taken my car to the Inchcape BMW Colchester, 6 times over the last year for a persistent airbag fault, I finally gave up and fixed the thing myself. Aside from being unable to properly diagnose the problem, the 'technicians' here were just bare faced liars. They provided me some pictures of some 'shoddy' wiring that was apparently the cause of all my problems but upon investigation at my own expense that shoddy wiring was their doing. When I took my findings back to them, it wasn't shoddy any more and couldn't possibly be the cause of the fault. Bottom line: If you don't mind paying $300 for an above average car wash then this is the circus for you; if you're scared of clowns avoid like the plague."
2022-02-14,5,Good friendly staff

2022-02-10,5,"I was purchasing my new Mini Cooper SD Roadster from long distance, but this made no difference to the excellent customer service and personal attention I received from Tom Smith. He kept me fully informed of the progress of the sale, he sent photos and a personal video of the car so I could see her in all her glory! Upon arrival - after a 4hr drive - my partner and myself were greeted with a smile and a welcome brew and we were given the time to look over the vehicle thoroughly and to take her for a test drive. We also received a personal meet and greet from the Manager to thank us for our custom and the effort for driving such a long distance. Throughout the whole experience Tom has been friendly, professional and non-pushy and I have also received excellent post purchase customer care. I would highly recommend without a shadow of doubt Inchcape Mini in Norwich - don't let the distance put you off from buying a Mini from them."
2022-02-09,1,Just tried to book my car in for service and MOT - Lexus Guildford have centralized this function - when ringing to make a booking despite me confirming the car and my address - wouldn't book the car in without a telephone number - car has been serviced with Guildford 10 years and there was a time when they knew their customers - i guess all good things come to an end.
2022-02-07,5,I've had my Jaguar since 2017 and had to bring it into Jaguar Preston over the years for various routine jobs. The staff there are always very helpful and a pleasure to deal with. Never had anything less than excellent service. Please pass on my regards from a happy and loyal customer.
2022-02-05,5,"WOW what an incredible CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

Following , an appalling experience with other dealerships and customer service (not Inchcape). I made enquiries to the Head Office here to see if I was able to book my Audi in for some maintenance work at a local inchcape dealership Bury Manchester as unsure with my vehicle not being a Volkswagen whether this was feasible. I had in the past of course, been a Customer at Inchcape when I owned a Volkswagen and remember the excellent service and top quality standard of workmanship I received then.

However, this particular lady I spoke with Vicky in customer Relations very pleasant , efficient , and professional made contact with Neil the Service Manager at Bury , between them both they made the necessary enquiries , decisions for me to bring my vehicle into their workshop. Again , the Service Manager pleasant experience , handled this very well excellent and very assertive

Thank you, restores my faith in Customer Service and I know where my vehicle will be heading in the future for maintenance Wouldn’t it be great if all customer relations were like this one brilliant . In fact, on this particular day both these employees as far as I’m concerned went above and beyond went the EXTRA MILE for the customer!"
2022-02-04,4,"No update when car was with dealer for 10 days, I had to call in for update.
2nd time this has happened. Previously car was in for a couple of days & I had to call in for update.

Car frequently coming in for oil leak or corroded problems & yet I am being charged extortionate prices which is not right for a vehicle that is well serviced & rarely driven in the last 2yrs due to corona.

I am having to ask for loyalty discounts & the amount giving is not enough considering the years of loyalty.

In total from 2014 to present, the vehicle has been with mercedes for 19 times & cost £8,209.98 if you add the service care plan over 3yrs, an additional £1,296.

So total cost, £9,505.98 for a car with current market value between £8000 to £10,000.

Latest update

Mercedes has now resolved the oil leak problem & also gave a gesture of goodwill for long term loyalty.

It should not have required a complaint to get here.

But decent quality service and treatment this time around."
2022-02-03,5,"Everyone at Inchcape Toyota Burton are very welcoming, helpful and knowledgeable. I am a long standing customer, replacing my Yaris for a new one every 2/3 years.

2022-02-03,1,Rang to arrange repair of steering wheel motor. Contacted the service dept. And asked if there was a repair kit. The chap had no idea and said he would contact the parts dept. to and a price for fitting it (if it existed). Phone then rang for a while until someone picked it up and put it down. I rang back and spoke to the same person in the service dept. They apologies profusely and said they would contact the parts dept. themselves whilst I was on the line. I waited for a while and then a female Came on the sine saying she was in the service dept. She had no idea of what I was talking about so emailed the parts manager and said he would call me back. I rang MB Wirral (an independent specialist). They knew exactly what I was talking about and quoted me all within 2 or 3 minutes. These main dealers could learn a lot from these independents and would urge the management at Ellesmere Port to contact MB Motors in Hoylake and take a look at how they look after potential customers.
2022-02-03,1,"Inscape Audi Hyde - Not a great experience to be honest, car went in for work to be carried out by warranty for new front shocks and coolant housing due to leak.

Then I get another call to suggest it also required a new wishbone and a new flange which wasn’t part of the initial check they did pre Christmas to determine the faults

Can went in beginning of Jan and didn’t get the car back until 22nd (16 days)

Then I get a call this week suggesting they didn’t know but they hadn’t fitted the wishbone as it was on back order but when I collected the car they said all work done

It’s only because it turned up that they realised it hadn’t been fitted

Not sure if this is to do with the wishbone but nearly lost control of the car on a bend - car started snaking at the back!

If the wishbone needed to be done then why release the car back to the owner!"

2022-02-02,1,"Maclesfield Inchcape have oversold me an alpha Romeo less than 6 months ago and now I find out there are a couple of issues; one of which requires engine work and is very risky, the other is a body work to change the alloy on the tyre which keeps leaking air at the rim. When I requested a detailed invoice for the £600 I paid on the service, I was told there wasn't one. Be aware, if you are buying used cars from George Woods who works at Maclesfield as they will rob you of the service money."

2022-02-01,1,"Very bad experience, I approved the changes by email around 13:05 and, and came around 13:30 to see the progress and been told that ""ooh we didn't see that, you need to wait until 14:00 for the can to be worked on"" which meant I will get my car around 14:45, that really stressed me out as I have other appointments I needed to go to, so I had to take the car without the needed work is done and it wasn't even washed, no I have find another place and spend more time to get the work done, although I booked the day off, I glad my 3 year service plan is over with Inchcape, I was planning to renew for another 3 year but not anymore, very bad experience and I don't recommend the service, you got the feeling that they have systems in place but everything is highly manually."

2022-01-31,5,"I had my annual service and MOT booked for Monday morning, 24 January. But on Friday evening, 21 January, my car broke down and RAC got me going just enough to get the car back in my driveway. Then on Saturday morning right at 9am when you opened, RAC arrived at Lexus Guildford with me and my car. Gemma took all this in stride. The vehicle was diagnosed on Monday morning with a faulty alternator. The vehicle is 16 years old, so these kind of things are to be expected. Gemma rearranged the service and MOT around the need to get the replacement alternator in and installed. The result was me getting my Lexus back in perfect order on the Wednesday. Thanks go to Gemma and all at Lexus Guildford for handling all this as if it was no problem at all. Accept for problems in 2021 when COVID restriction problems meant that my annual service had to be cancelled, no one other than Lexus Guildford has ever touched my car and that is the way it is going to remain."

He was honestly fantastic from the start when we initially made phone calls about the car, to him providing an in-depth video about the car, dealing with queries/questions
All the way up to had over of the car. Which we was more than please with. Considering we had not even seen the car in person before hand over.

Well done Chris ward! Great customer service

2022-01-27,1,"Placed a deposit on a car at the Toyota dealership in Burton. They then proceeded to cancel the reservation stating that the car wasn’t fit to trade. Has been three weeks and still they haven’t returned my deposit.

Be very wary of this dealer!!!"
2022-01-26,1,"Please take car when buying an older vehicle from this garage.
I bought an 11 plate Clio in Oct 2020. In Oct 2021 it failed its MOT with a severely corroded subframe. It has now been to 2 garages, both individually stated that they cannot believe it had passed an MOT prior to being sold. The subframe was so bad that you could put a whole hand through the rusted metal
This company accept no responsibility and have stated that it must have happened in the 12 months that I owned the vehicle. Whilst I don't claim to be an expert in the science of metal corrosion, I do know that a steel frame doesn't rust that quick!
So disappointed in a supposedly reputable company!"

2022-01-26,1,"Preston Jaguar Land Rover : One of the worst buying experiences I've ever had.

Took a deposit from me in person, on a new car that was supposedly in stock and sitting in their Norwich showroom and I was given the impression it was a week or so to get the car over ready for my collection.

About 10 days later and no firm commitment on delivery, then I was finally told the car could not be released until it's new replacement was received by Land Rover. A few days after that and I still can't even establish which month I might be able to receive the new car.

Then I ring the Norwich dealership, only to be told the car in question was sold weeks ago by one of their staff so they didn't even have a car for me.

I'd even called the sales manager at Preston after a week or so and didn't get a meaningful response out of him.

I will never pass any money to an Inchcape dealership if this is the way they handle their customers. Lies, deciet & avoidance from day 1."

2022-01-20,1,"Firstly I don’t find it surprising that inchcape have changed their name on trustpilot to get rid of all their bad reviews. Inchcape are ok as a retailer until you have a problem and then they just ignore you. We bought a used car from Inchcape VW Swindon 7 months ago in the knowledge that they were a big group who were backing their sales with a 12 month warranty. Unfortunately the car has developed an engine failure (which they cannot diagnose) after we have driven it less than 4000 miles. Inchcape took the car in before Christmas and have not phoned us once to give any sort of update. After much chasing, their response was ‘we have come to the end of the line with what we can do’. We have been trying to start a dialogue with the manager and the head office but are just ignored. In short… they take your money and then you are on your own! Believe me, you cannot afford to deal with Inchcape! Find a more responsible dealer."

2022-01-17,1,This relates to the body warranty work to replace the tailgate. The actual work done by the body shop was good and the body shop is not at fault. However the service organisation is dire. I had to continually chase to get the job done. Paperwork got “lost”. The job took twice as long as I was told and Nobody bothered to call me when the car was kept in past due date. I was left without a perfectly usable car for nearly two weeks because parts were not secured before taking the car in. A total shambles.
2022-01-17,5,"I booked for my car to be collected from home, which was an excellent part of the service. A health check video was sent to me to show where the coolant pump had been leaking.

I was also told that my vehicle would be ready before 4pm, so I arranged for transport accordingly. When I hadn't been contacted by 3.30pm I called for an update, I was told there would now be a delay and my car would be ready between 4.30/5.00pm.
As my transport would not be available at those times, I again questioned this.
I was informed that the service engineer working on my car had previously failed to reserve the parts that should have been allocated. As a result, these parts had been given to someone else and the branch then needed to reorder and there was a delay on delivery?
I pointed out what an inconvenience this was to me and was told I could go earlier and sit and wait??
As I run my own business and still had meetings to deal with, this was not an option.
At 4pm I received a call to say my vehicle was now ready for collection and would receive a free MOT (when it was due) for the inconvenience.
Whilst I accept that sometimes things do not run smoothly, simply keeping a customer updated as soon as you realise there is a problem, can give the opportunity to work with you and rearrange things.
Over the years I have purchased three new X5's through this branch and due to the level of service I received, I purchased my current vehicle elsewhere. I really hoped things had changed at this branch, but my recent visit says not!"
2022-01-17,5,I am very happy with the service.
2022-01-16,1,"Visited the Coventry branch for my partner to view a Mercedes’. The dealer was incredibly rude. He provided us with NO information about the car, my partner wasn’t allowed to even sit in the car, let alone test drive it. Mohammed asked my partner ‘not many people your age can afford this car. What is your salary to be able to afford this?’ He scoffed and was highly judgemental. This experience led to us not buying the car and going elsewhere. Truly terrible experience that made us feel very uncomfortable."
2022-01-14,5,My car basin for warranty work and to have a dash cam fitted. Whilst it was with the garage it was accidentally damaged by a customer. The garage told me and arranged for repairs to my car to be undertaken without cost or inconvenience to me. The repairs together with the planned work were undertaken promptly and professionally.
2022-01-14,5,Very professional in dealing with my request
2022-01-13,5,"3 reasons why I buy Toyotas from and have them serviced at Oxford Toyota: 1, Andrew Robey. 2, Douglas Robson. 3, Technician Team. Don’t underestimate what these people deliver and mean to your business. Outstanding."
2022-01-12,1,"I have some very good, clear and very honest advise for anyone thinking to obtain any motor vehicle from here. STAY AWAY!! Customer service is none existent, sales staff have a very poor product knowledge base. They consistently lie and you don't get the vehicle you ordered.!!!! In 45 years of being a motorist and regularly buying new vehicles this has been the worst ever.... By far."
2022-01-11,5,Looked after me very well keeping me informed throughout the day and offering me various alternatives for possible future work. Made me feel like a valued customer. An excellent professional service.
2022-01-11,5,"Fantastic experience from the moment i walked in, I cant recommend this dealership enough!"
2022-01-10,5,My car was booked for a recall but during this process I was offered a deal on my air conditioning which I thought was great. Then even better they carried out a complimentary health check which was lucky as my suspension had broken on one side. Paul at Mercedes went above and beyond to make sure I was safe and provided me with a loan car as I would of struggled to get to work while he got the part. Paul and the Mercedes team went above and beyond to ensure everything was effortless and safe. This also makes me want a newer Mercedes model now :) also thank you for washing and making my car look pristine along with informing me of ‘Me’ application that I have now downloaded too. 5 star service!
2022-01-10,5,Excellent service from the service department.
2022-01-10,1,"Service took 3 hours longer than should have. No explanation. They didn't answer the phone when I called to check on progress. Was told I had booked drop and go service which takes all day, but I had booked express and had the confirmation. It was queried whether I had paid or not when I had paid two days before online at the time of booking. Staff generally rude and defensive. As a customer made to feel like an annoyance. Not a nice experience."

Inchcape need to make sure they keep her"
2022-01-06,1,Had taken my car into Audi Stockport for a key fob recall. Car was scratched when being washed. Looks like the power wash hose was dragged along rear of car leaving several scratches to rear of car. My car is black and the scratches show up as white like skates on ice. Will never use this dealer again.
2022-01-05,5,"I had the pleasure to meet Paul Care at Lexus Guildford, who is amazing professional! Paul was extremely helpful through out the process of getting my Lexus nx300h, even though the car is 2015 its in great condition, just like new.

I rang Telford VW Inchcape,m, where I bought it, who were not very helpful at all and couldn’t see the car for 3 days? This was in my opinion a 2 min job to replace the wiper and after spending £30k on a car you think they would be more helpful. I then rang the Shrewsbury VW dealership and they asked me to come in straight away, which I did and 5 min later all sorted, how difficult was that. Thanks Charlotte for your help 10/10."
2022-01-03,5,"My recent visit to Inchcape Basingstoke went very smoothly, I was greeted by a very nice receptionist, my car was taken in immediately, I had a pleasant coffee and the safety recall was carried out within the 2 hour period. I also came away with a very clean car - thank you!"

2021-12-31,5,Very helpful dn very good service
2021-12-29,1,"BEWARE. I would not recommend the Inchcape Norwich JLR garage in any aspect. They had a complete lack of respect for me as a customer and my vehicle, they breached the Consumer Rights Act and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations. They are not certified with the Motor Ombudsman (as one would expect from such a well known garage franchise), and so it appears they don’t feel that they are accountable to any third party.

Their head of service I have found to be particularly rude. Insisting on their cooperation with the ombudsman despite not being affiliated with them, which came across as very mocking towards me and the situation that they left my car in after they damaged it. He also has an apparent inability to honour anything that I already had in writing.

My car initially went in fully working except for the gps map system, which went in for diagnosis, the actions of the garage caused the entire infotainment system to cease working - leaving my vehicle in a considerably worse state. With no working radio, no parking sensors, no access to car system information. At no point did they advise me of any risk to my car’s functionality and I therefore was not able to make an informed decision or give consent. Following which I was lied to and bullied into returning the courtesy car and coerced into collecting my vehicle in its degraded state, despite the dispute being ongoing.
My vehicle was in the garage for over 2 months, and up until the point that they wanted to offload it back onto me the communication was shocking.

I really doubt that it is just me who has had a negative experience with this garage, given that the Net Promoter Score (which is based on customer feedback directly given to Jaguar Land Rover) is absolutely shocking, and they were in the bottom 10 performing LR sites.

I would personally advise any one considering using this garage to go elsewhere and avoid it at all costs."
2021-12-27,2,Dealership failed to fix problem a problem properly first time then ignored the request to fix same problem a second time. Normally score dealership highly but they have let me down on this occasion.
2021-12-25,1,Put in a Finnace application with Land Rover Inchcape Derby the salesman Clive (so called SVR specialist) couldn’t stop calling me enough when he needed my business soon as my Finnace application went in and I had paid a deposit to reserve the car waited days and days called up several times in a day to speak with Clive never heard anything never once did he call me to update on what’s going on with my application after waiting 3 days I decided to call up myself to get a update and was told by the sales manager my application had been declined. Clive never even had the decency or courtesy to call me and tell me as a customer I would have appreciated a courtesy call to update me. This is why I hate main car dealers they don’t leave you alone and soon as you do put in a application for Finnace and they take a deposit of you your just a sale to them. I understand there job is sales but customer service and satisfaction should also be part of there job forking out nearly 95k on a new car this is the least I expect a call to update me on my application. This has left a sour taste in my mouth and totally ruined my whole experience of buying a car from a main dealer such as Land Rover.
2021-12-24,5,"Highly recommend Chelmsford mini and Ross White who looked after me throughout my sale of my beautiful mini.
Highly recommend Ross"
2021-12-23,1,Terrible service. Rip off costs for servicing. Every time car goes in to be serviced some computer generated warning magically appears and some hidden part costing £2000 is needed....every time. hmmm
2021-12-21,5,"Very efficient service, would highly recommend,"
2021-12-21,1,"Shocking service, hugely arrogant, awfully rude and hugely unhelpful. DO NOT USE. Go to Hatfield Landrover in Liverpool or Shrewsbury instead.

I can't recall ever having received such bad service. I took my 2015 RR Sport in for a repair. On checking in I explained I'd had some work done elsewhere and left bill out so they could see work carried out. The manager checking me in (I think called Andrew Hayes) thanked me and said that would help service engineers.

When car inspected on day 1, two issues identified including an oil leak.

Same person called me two days later and told work all done and car ready to be collected.

I travelled back to Chester (not a short journey from where I live), dropped off a hire car I had arranged (as Chester Inchcape had no cars available) and made my way back to pick up my car.

Upon arrival at the garage, late afternoon on a Friday, I was told a mistake had been made and the oil leak had not been fixed and car was ""hemorrhaging"" oil.

That was, as you might imagine, infuriating and left me high and dry with no car for weekend, with weekend plans to go away.

I asked for a courtesy or demo car or anything so that I could get home and keep my weekend plans.

I was told nothing was available and that they couldn't help me. I asked to see the branch Manager and a person called Jamie Menzies reluctantly came to see me.

I've never met such an unhelpful, arrogant and unpleasant chap as Mr Menzies. Rather than apologising for their mistake and trying to find a solution, even offering to pay for a taxi home (which would have been reasonable), he said he was not going to allow the garage to do any more work / to fix the oil leak as I'd had previous work done elsewhere, despite fact that I'd told the garage about the previous work when I dropped the car off and left them the invoice so they knew what had been done - and had been thanked for doing so on check in!

I'm implored Mr Menzies to help as I was left stuck and needed the work doing. He arrogantly and rudely refused point blank. Instead he produced the car key and sent me on my way!

I was utterly and completely
humiliated - and left high and dry late afternoon on Friday to sort the problem myself.

I received the standard customer feedback / marketing telephone call a week or two later. I recounted my experience. I'd at least expected
some sort of follow up or an apology of sorts. However I have heard nothing back, some two weeks later. The customer call seemingly being meaningless.

Ironically, as I explained when I took the car in for the repair, as it's 2015
Model with high miles, I need a new one. I've since placed a deposit for a new RR with Hatfield Land Rover Liverpool and service has been good."
2021-12-20,5,Very good service from start to finish. Hugh provided a detailed video of the vehicle health check so well done and thanks.
2021-12-20,5,Vehicle was collected the work done and the vehicle was returned without fuss.
2021-12-20,5,"When booking in the car the system is very easy.
On first inspection I was made aware of the problem and also an estimate of the cost of the repair.
Liam was excellent in the way that he was able to explain what was to be done in a way that I could easily understand.
The work was carried out on time and yet again Liam explained clearly about the costings and the vehicle was collected and thanks to all involved now does what it should.
I have no problem in recommending Inchcape to any future customers whether they are business users or private customers."
2021-12-20,1,"I have just bought a used BMW from Inchcape. Their prices are higher than other main dealers but the car had the features I wanted. I was rather irritated to find that I would have to pay still more to activate Apple CarPlay and Real-Time Traffic Information, which could have been included.

When I got the car, there was a message on start-up saying that a service would be due in less than three months, and also that I would need replacement brake pads in 3,000 miles (I have had the brake pads checked - they were new, so the computer hadn't been reset). The head-up display was misaligned, and one of the keys had a flat battery.

I was sufficiently concerned to get the car checked by my local mechanic, who reported that the windscreen needed replacing due to a crack, and who found an oil leak from the turbo, which also needed replacing (a big job). His opinion was that they hadn't even put the car up on a ramp to inspect it properly. It was supposed to have been fully serviced before I bought it.

I am waiting for Inchcape to get back to me about these problems, but this isn't the sort of hassle I expect when buying from a franchised dealer.

Bizarrely, Inchcape themselves have invited me to write this review."
2021-12-20,5,"I purchased a brand new F-Pace P400e through Inchcape JLR Guildford and had a very positive experience. Due to industry wide pressures, I had a longer engagement time with the sales department as the vehicle took 6mths, but they remained attentive throughout. The ordering process was seemless, all documents were signed remotely, making pick up on the day simple. Contact was also a plus point, replying to my emails always within the hour, but often within 10/15mins.
As for handover, a really positive experience, Graham Champion and Gavin Moody really made me feel welcome. This is important to me as I have been in dealers another Jaguar dealer and felt like an inconvenience.
Overall, it was a good experience and I would recommend Inchcape Guildford to anybody in the market for a new vehicle!!"
2021-12-18,1,"Inchcape BMW of Reading UK deceived me when I booked in my car for service over the phone.
I asked if the service was free, they said yes so I assumed I had a service pack on my car.
They said the map update would take longer so would have to leave my car with them, to which I replied I can do it myself.
The day before the booking, Inchcape called me to confirm booking, I asked a second time, is the service free, to which I was told yes.
After my car was serviced on the day I was told I had to pay for the service.
£486.00 for a brake fluid flush and cabin filter change, when I was told it was free of charge?
It should cost around £230.00 as seen by Facebook group members invoices from main dealers.
When the service person came to tell me the car was ready said we were going to put a new tyre repair kit in at £140.00 as yours is missing.
No mention of the warning triangle which is an MOT failure if missing!
I told him that it is in the boot with two warning triangles.
Surely they would have opened the boot area during an inspection right?
The washer fluid which is part of a service was not even topped up.
I still 5 days later have not got my so-called health check video emailed to me?
Makes me wonder if they actually flushed the brake fluid or changed the cabin filters now.
Absolutely abysmal service and lack of integrity from a company that is representing BMW
Inchcape BMW of Reading AVOID or risk getting ripped off for a service that is supposed to cost just over £200 from most other BMW dealers in the UK
My charge £486.00
Other Facebook i3 owners invoices are much cheaper, one was even with REX engine service!
Unfortunately have to leave at least one star otherwise I choose 0 stars
Funny thing is, I have purchased thousands of pounds worth of parts from this dealerships parts department, so no loyalty there even.
Will be perusing this with trading standards & the Motor Ombudsman
The least I wanted was to get half my money back from being overcharged"

2021-12-10,4,"My first experience with Inchape Toyota Kidlington was not very good when I brought my car for a repair. They booked it for an incorrect problem, so they did not reserve enough time for the investigation or they would not be aware of me coming in at all, etc... I was not allowed to talk to the mechanic until I complained. The communication with me as a customer was poor and there was a lack of communication between the employees too. I was repeatedly disappointed and I had to officially complain to be heard.  
The General Manager took care of the problem and I met some very nice and helpful people afterwards - Anthea, Andrew.
I was given a loan car for a very generous time, this was a very nice surprise.
Unfortunately, my car repair was too expensive, so I traded it for a different car with them and I have to say that the sales part of this branch is friendly and helpful, thank you Mitchell."

2021-12-08,5,"Inchcape Nottingham,
Phil Litchfield the representative who supported us
Excellent service, from walking in not really clear at all on what I wanted, just knew it had to be automatic. Phil went through careful questioning and probing to find out what is important to me (and my husband who might be allowed to drive the car occasionally!). He took time with us, and never made us feel rushed or in any way pressurised.
We have ended up with a gorgeous GLA which is fabulous, and everything (and more) than I could have wanted.
The communication at all times has been outstanding, and the handover was thorough and not at all rushed, with offers of ongoing support if / when needed.
Overall, I would very highly recommend inchcape Nottingham, and Phil.
Having received very poor customer service elsewhere (not car related) recently, it has been a delight to deal with someone who clearly has a very high level of customer focus and attention.
Thank you, Katrina & Des"
2021-12-07,3,"Initially I booked my 2016 VW Golf into the Shrewsbury Inchcape dealership on 23/11/21 for a diagnostic as the EPC and engine management lights kept coming on and going off over a number of days. The car's performance during the time the warning lights had been intermittently coming on and off was normal. When I arrived I was advised that they would be keeping the car all day. As I live 20 miles from the dealership I asked for a courtesy car and was informed that I would have to book a new appointment as a courtesy car needs booking in advance. I booked a new date on the 3/12/21. Following the diagnostic I was informed that the turbo actuator rod was seized and would need replacing at cost of £480, a lot of money to replace something that was only 5 years old. I agreed that the work should be carried out as I am dependant on having a car due to the rural area I live in. On the 4/12/21 I rang the dealership and spoke to Ellie and requested that she leave a message for Charlotte Jones, the service advisor dealing with my car. The message was that I wanted the part that they were replacing to be left in the car as I wanted to know what I was purchasing for £480. On collecting the car on 7/12/21 I was informed that the part was not available as the message had not been passed on. Therefore I couldn't see or check what I had paid for and I will not be using this service centre in the future !!"

2021-12-02,1,"Had a Q7 on a 4yr PCP -- first of all, during this time they've been extremely unresponsive, for example: (1) got an automated email about upgrading to a different car, contacted them via phone and email about it, no response (2) on separate occasions asked questions about the car, no response (3) went to see the person who sold me the car in the first place, told them that I want to get another car, gave them exact specs, they took notes and said they'd contact me with a quote, no response, and finally now (4) brought in my Q7 back after 2.5yrs and they offered me ~£2,000 to take it back (as it has appreciated in value considerably); I brought the car back and signed their documents (in person and via Docusign), no response whatsoever and no money after 10 days (at first, they said it would take up to 7 days to receive the money, then the receptionist switched it up to 7-10 days). Also, the dealership looks... underwhelming, to put it mildly. Do yourself a favour and avoid this particular Audi dealer."

Unfortunately the car was collected in the dark at the time appointed to us. The next day revealed major issues with the bodywork as the ceramic coating that was sold to us and applied was not done correctly, leaving the areas of the bodywork in a real mess. Also some paintwork and paint chips that should have been rectified before collection and before the ceramic coating application had not been done. Very poor service from what we thought was a brand we could trust from a dealer that has let us down badly. NOT THE EXPERIENCE WE EXPECTED AT ALL FROM INCHCAPE & MERCEDES !"

2021-11-24,5,I recently bought a Tiguan at Inchcape Swindon and dealt with Luke throughout the purchase process. It all went extremely smoothly and Luke was excellent to interact with as we discussed and signed off the the paperwork. I saw the car on Friday and collected it on Monday. I am not one for feeling comfortable in car dealerships but I found the whole experience enjoyable. I am very happy with my car and look forward to upgrading at Inchcape in the next couple of years.
2021-11-22,1,"When I initially contacted inchcape, I was trying to call for 3 days, and either the phone was ringing out, or a really polite lady would answer me and promise me a call back, which never happened. I eventually got through to Eleanor who explained it was because of how busy they were, however managed to pencil me in for an appointment the next day on a Saturday. When I first went to view the car, I explained my budget and Eleanor was really helpful in showing me which options were best for me. I decided which car to buy, and I was going to part exchange my vehicle. Eleanor then went to ‘inspect’ the vehicle, however in reality just walked around the car, took pictures on her iPad and then we went inside. She then told me the price she could get on my car based on the information I had given her. She then asked me if I wanted Extended Warranty on the car, to which I said no. She then proceeded to get me figures for the extended warranty anyway, despite me declining. Finally we agreed on sorting a deal out for the car, and I had to pay a £500 ‘reserve fee’ which I was told I’d get straight back as soon as I purchased the car. The car was agreed to be picked up in a week. I then got an email from Eleanor a few days later saying it would have to be delayed a few days for some reason. When I picked the car up finally, I signed the paperwork, drove off with the car, and the vehicle itself is satisfactory, despite the fact it will need rear tires within 2 months as they’re severely worn down. Despite this, the service was okay, I had the vehicle and I considered everything sorted.

I then got an email 3 days after saying that Inchcape needed to keep £250 of my £500 reservation fee as I hadn’t accurately described my vehicles service history, despite giving Eleanor every chance to check the service history upon appraisal and re appraisal of the vehicle, which she didn’t do. I then received a forceful email from Andy, the used sales manager, saying that they had to keep my £250 despite having already signed a contract for my vehicles value. I replied to Andy and he didn’t even read my email, let alone get back to me, until I called the dealership 3 times a day, and each time I called he was conveniently ‘away from his desk’. Andy finally called me, and proceeded to tell me that it was my fault for not notifying Inchcape of the service history and that they needed to keep the £250, despite the fact that doing so would be a breach of contract. Andy then lectured me how it was my responsibility to ensure my vehicle is serviced regularly. When I told Andy I would be going to the Motor Ombudsmen to resolve this, he then decided in the ‘interest of both parties’ it would be best to resolve the issue and give me MY OWN deposit back, once he realised he couldn’t bully me into trying to recoup some of money they’d lost from incorrectly valuing my vehicle. Eleanor was lovely and helpful, but I was really disappointed by Andy who, as a Manager, did nothing but try to dissuade me out of £250 for the mistake one of his employees had made."

2021-11-22,5,"I had a very good experience with Toyota Inchcape. As a first-time buyer, I was concerned about doing the right choice. The car is great, was serviced and valeted and the whole process run smoothly. The sales consultant Thiago de Freitas was very helpful.
Also, I was given 1 year of breakdown assistance for free!
I felt I done the best choice. I do recommend Toyota Inchcape."
2021-11-20,1,"""INCHCAPE TOYOTA SANDHURST""
Today 20/11/2021 early afternoon Me and my Mrs went to see cars in Inchcape Toyota Sandhurst. We were looking for a Yaris Cross Hybrid Icon. We were outside for roughly 45 mins looking for cars. I can't believe that none of them came out and asked for questions. So, we decided to leave and as we're heading toward my car, I noticed the car we're looking at was packed nearby a workshop.

So, I changed my mind and went back in and the receptionist talked to me and she was friendly. I told her why I'm here. She immediately grabbed the phone and called someone and informed me that they'll be here in 2 to 3 mins. However, I was waiting and waiting, while I was waiting at the same time another customer came in, and she was served immediately without any delay. But why didn't I understand? Where is fairness? I’m so disappointed I had to wait a long time until no one came out. I told the receptionist sorry I can’t wait too long, I have to go and I walked away.

The question is I don’t know how they treat the customers??? Or do they judge customers??? Etc etc............................................??? Therefore I'll never ever recommend Inchcape Sandhurst Toyota.



After that we went to Bracknell — Jemca Toyota Bracknell. OMG! They are an approachable team, very friendly and very much customers care too. Especially Mark plus his team. No doubt I’ll recommend to my families, friends and others too all day long please visit once if you’re looking for Toyota Cars."

Shambles. Told by the sales manager that the car we test drove was 110bhp. We purchased it on that basis only to find out when insuring it that it was a 95bhp model.
We'd agreed to pick up the car up on a Saturday, only to be informed on the Saturday morning that it would have to be done on a different as the admin team don't work Saturdays.
Absolutely no discretion used who we then asked for a discount of less than 5% of a 110bhp model.
We've asked for our money back and will look elsewhere."

Inchcape proudly say all used vehicles receive a thorough check before handed over to the owner.
Inchcape finally agreed to give my daughter a complete refund. We had to lent her the money to buy another car before the monies would be recieved from Inchcape. They are quick enough to take the money when you buy a car, but it takes up to 5-7 days to be refunded. Buyer be aware, customer service is extremely poor at Inchcape Exeter, they do not care!!!!

2021-11-15,1,"Took my partners mini in for a routine annual service. the car was in perfect working order. I was looking for an oil and filter change, but upon giving my registration to their sales team I was up sold to pay £360 to include new spark plugs and another filter. It was only when speaking with my brother I realised the car was a diesel and didn't have spark plugs. I let this go as it wasn't a big deal at the time. I picked my car up and drove it home. The next time i went to use it it wouldn't start for the first 5 attempts when it did eventually fire up I knew something didn't sound right and it was noisier than usual.

I called BMW Mini that agreed to take it back and look at it as an emergency appointment on Saturday. They said I had to pay to arrange for it to come back but that they could sort this out later out of good will.

I called back to say I couldn't get it back in on the Saturday but i could have it their first thing Monday morning. They assured me they would be expecting it and it would be treated as an emergency appointment.

I called them at 14:30pm to get an update on the Monday so i could see what transport i needed to arrange for my pregnant partner to get to work the following day. I was told the service team were unavailable but someone would call me back. I was then called back and told it hadn't been seen yet and that they did have other cars to work on that day.

I eventually received a call late in the day to say ""surprise surprise"" that the issue with the car was unrelated to the service. They tried to belittle my case by saying my cars age and mileage were the issues. After I paid £120 to have the car recovered to BMW Mini the best 'Goodwill' package the service manage could offer was for me to pay a further £500 for them to diagnose the problem.

You literally couldn't write it. I overpaid on a service that was quoted on product my car doesn't have. Hadn't back to me then the next time i go to use it it doesn't work and they want me to pay £500 to take another look at it or as the service manager said he can 'box it up' for me."
2021-11-14,1,"Arrived at Inchcape Shrewsbury found the Z4 the salesman asked if we were cash buyers or part exchange I explained we were cash buyers, the car was priced at £14,215 across the windscreen. The sales man got us the keys and then returned and said that the car price had gone up by their head office and if we still want it the price is now £15,050 as their head office change the prices hourly!!! Never experienced anything like this before what an absolute con do not buy from these this is a disgrace- so if we arrived 10 minutes earlier the car would have been £800 cheaper I am going to contact trading standards this cannot be legal surely this is misrepresentation having customers travelling under false pretences, this is obviously common practice reading other reviews- I appreciate prices can change but not once you are physically on site ready to buy."

Car smelt like wet dog and was covered in dog hair which was then sprayed by the garage to hide it from us after an appalling valet.

We were told the car would be sprayed to rectify the large scratches and work would be done on the alloys to buffer the large scratches and dents. Took for the car to go into the garage 3 times to be returned in exactly the same poor state.

The seat in the boot wouldn’t go down after it was put up and we were told to ‘punch it’ to force it down before they eventually fixed it.

Decided the return the car after weeks of messing about and overall poor standard. Still waiting for a refund despite being told by two managers that it was being processed. Still to this date the paper work hasn’t been done and we are waiting for a refund of thousands of pounds

Disgusting service from what is supposed to be a luxury brand."

2021-11-10,2,"* Weeks further on and still no reply to the review!

Rather like the 'Curate's Egg' it was good in parts. Not particularly impressed by the insistence that we paid a £99 reservation fee (we wouldn't). A buyer maybe going to see several cars in one day - involving a lot of expenditure and refunds (never easy). Your website does not appear to show the 'value and reasons' why a purchaser should paid a fee either.

Our return journey was just short of 200 miles. Our salesman contacted us on our drive down to ensure we were still coming (as we hadn't paid the wretched reservation fee). Yes, we were on the way, but stuck on the M25, and eventually we were an hour late. We were greeted by the salesman, who immediately informed us that the vehicle we had come to see had increased in price by £400. He had every opportunity to contact us before we left (a time was given) to inform us of this. This is not the way of business expected from a main dealer. The car has not cost you any more, is merely sitting outside. We were then offered less than the stated amount for our part exchange. Please do not give me a lecture regarding current market values.

We took the car for a test drive, were satisfied with it and started the purchase process, which went from bad to worse. As usual the salesman has to venture higher and higher up the ladder of authority, and each time there was no room for manoeuvre whatsoever. Your car had magically increased by £400 and ours had decreased by £400 overnight.

What was supposed to be a 'pleasant experience' turned out to be anything but, and we left your premises with a very bitter taste in our mouths and no car, and a 7 hour round trip.

Several calls to us over a period of time, a decision was made that we purchased the car for the price originally advertised, and a suitable price given for our PX.

We felt we were pushed to buy extras, such as paint protection (the car is 6), alloy wheel protection, Gap insurance and finance. We wanted and needed none of these. I know these are extra bonuses for you, but not for us!

Upon collection of the car, the service warning light came on as we went to drive away - the car had to go back to the service area to be 're-set'. I looked to see if the manual was in the car, it wasn't, so popped back into the showroom to ask where it was. I was told by a very supercilious and evidently 'higher up the chain executive' that didn't I know that all new cars have only online manuals?"" Why would I know this? I have no idea at what point paper manuals were stopped.

All in all, it was a pretty dire experience. Our salesman, Steve Barleycorn did his best to rectify a bad situation, his strings were evidently being pulled very hard by those above, who should actually bother to come and do his job.

We are pleased with the car, which was the only decent thing to come out this whole sorry debacle, and has put us off with purchasing from a main dealer ever again."

On this occasion Halfords wanted to charge me 250 pounds more than Mercedes. I was originally quoted 1072 pounds which included a new set of front wiper blades. On arrival I was charged 1003 pounds. 69 pounds less than first quoted. Mercedes have definitely made a customer out of me, Very happy with the work done."

2021-11-07,1,"If you think to buy a car from them, do not expect to get any assistance if your car is faulty or has any issue.

I bought a Fiat 500L online in September from Burton on Trent and had it delivered in Bristol. Before concluding the agreement I got several calls from one of the agents, they sounded professionals and reliable. So I trusted and went ahead with purchase.

My car was delivered on a Saturday morning at 9.00 am. The lady who drove the car was stinking of alcohol and was already fully drunk in the early morning after a 3 hours of dangerous driving. She was shaking and could not put 2 words together.

The car also was delivered with wore wipers and without mats, things that you would expect to find when buying a second car from a car dealer and not a private.

However on Saturday and Sunday I tested the car and found out that the temperature displayed crazy numbers like -17 when it was +12, the fuel tank level sensor did not work and the Start & Stop did not work either.

So on Monday morning I got in touch with them who asked to contact the warranty. The warranty, of course, said that the car was already faulty when delivered and that the car dealer was supposed to take care of it.

I got back in touch with them, explained what I was told by the warranty company and they recommended me to get in touch with another Inchape branch in Cheltenham as it would be closer to Bristol.

Called the Cheltenham branch and they said they would talk to Burton branch and would get back to me.

2 weeks went by and nobody contacted me. Sent an email to Burton branch and reported the matter and they did not even bother to reply.

2 more weeks went by and I sent a further email of complaint to the Burton branch who replied they had forwarded my email to the supervisor and that they should have already contacted me.

1 more week went by, sent them another email and they just limited to reply that they had offered me a solution and they could not help me further:

Their solution was:

- first to use the warranty that would not take care of a problem already present at the moment of the purchase

- second to contact the other branch that would not care to solve my issue.

2 months have gone by and never heard from them. Stay away!! Buying from the is a lottery. If you are lucky and the car is faultless then they will be great, but if your car has any issue then... here I am."

2021-11-05,1,"Shocking and shambolic service to say the least. Initially went in with my mother, was told that the car would be ready at 5 even though I’d booked a ‘waiting’ MOT appointment, which I was told would take between 1 hour and 15 minutes to 2 hours. Explained was told this by the booking centre but apparently the dealership had not been informed that this was a waiting appointment. Then asked regarding price match, which again is clearly stated on the website and I was informed that it was possible by the service booking centre. I was told that they don’t price match but would on this occasion. Was told I could wait but it was going to take about 2/3 hours. I agreed on that basis. However, wasn’t offered any alternative, lift to home, courtesy car etc. Never mind any of the comfort options, we weren’t even offered a drink or cup of coffee. Around 4pm, 5 hours after we had been there, the gentleman came back to me to inform me that the vehicle had failed on a small cut in the middle of the tyre. I had got all 4 tyres changed and check prior to my MOT appointment as I was aware that these are common failings, so I was shocked when I was told this. The gentleman showed me a picture. Now the GOV website states that it’s only a fail if the cords are visible, however I was unable to see any cords on the picture. I was then told if I bought the tyre within 10 minutes, they could pass the car and not put it down as a fail. Initially quoted £210 for a tyre that I could get from a national tyre retailer for £150 asked if they could pricematch was told the best they could do was £160. Anyway the gentleman came back and said it had been put down as a fail, and that I could get it retested once I’d got the tyre replaced elsewhere. I took the car and got the tyre changed immediately, even the gentle and changing the tyre said no cords were visible. Regardless, I was asked to call the next day before I bought my car back in for a retest. So I called at around 11:30 to give heads up that I was on my way. I was informed that the engineers were on lunch from 12-2pm so I would have to wait if I came now. I mean I appreciate that inchcape may provide 2 hour lunches to make it an attractive place of employment but from a customer perspective, it may explain the 5 hour wait the day before. Overall, I am a regular customer at inchcape, the vehicle was even purchased from inchacape. This experience has been awful and the customer service received not less than shambolic. I don’t think I’ll be using inchcape again. I’d use inchcape over my local dealership in Oldham but this experience has definitely made me lose all condition inchcape. If you can’t provide good aftercare then why would I and my family spend my money with yourselves. I hope this is properly investigated, staff briefed and trained where required and that no other customers go through this or a similar experience."
2021-11-04,3,"Update to original complaint below.
Inchcape have now refunded my reservation fee. I've updated the review to 3 stars for acknowledging my complaint. However, I wished it had been dealt with immediately instead of going through this whole complaint process. Please do better Inchcape.

Original complaint.
I saw a car advertised on a used car website. I wanted to test drive a Ford Focus 2010 and noticed it was in their Stockport branch. Tom said they could bring the car down, but needed a reservation fee of £249 rather than the advertised £99. So stupidly I paid it.
A couple of weeks later I was told that the car has some issues that they were sorting. As soon as they were sorted they would bring the car down to test drive. They said that provided the car was ok would I still be looking to buy it.
I said yes, as I thought they are sorting everything out.
Eventually the car arrived and I went to test drive it. It was raining and the car drove well. The wipers made a horrendous noise so I knew they would need changing, which got me thinking whether the MOT had been carried out. After the test drive I had a look around the car and noticed also the tread on the tires were running low.
I asked them when the MOT was carried out. They brought up the MOT on the Government site. The MOT I think was about the 14th October, so a couple of weeks before the car came down. It was then I noticed some advisory details on the MOT that I was unaware of. Pretty much 3 of the tyres would need changing within the next few months. I was not advised of these prior to the car being brought down.
They were not going to change them or reduce the price. The cost would be in the region of £200 on a £2500 purchase price so I decided not to proceed and asked for my reservation fee back.
I was told I couldn't because the car was road legal and drove as expected. I do not agree with that, because the reservation fee was placed on the car in good faith prior to being told that some major work needed to be done. After hearing that, I was at that time still interested in the car.
The day of the test drive was the first time that I'd seen the MOT document and the first time knowing about the advisories.
Therefore, I was entitled to a refund because the full facts were not given to me prior to bringing the car down.
Had I been told about the advisories I would not have asked them to bring the car down to Cheltenham also taking into account the other previous work. So having all the facts would have made a difference."
2021-11-03,4,"As part of the service, i note you wash the car as well. However, it appears that this only comprised of a normal jet wash but when dried left drip marks throughout with the roof not washed at all. If you are offering this as part of the service then my suggestion is this is either done fully and properly or not done at all as I then had to have the car washed again.
Separately, within 1 week of the service, i received a warning light advising of low tyre pressure to the spare wheel. Does this not form part of the service checks?"

2021-10-25,2,"Inchcape Cheltenham.
I have bought two brand new cars from them within the last two years.
The new car process has gone well.
The one thing that really let's them down is awful customer service. It is virtually impossible to get hold of them most of the time,as nobody answers the phone...no matter which extension you call..and believe me I have tried dozens of times over the last couple of months or so. I've had to chase them up countless times before getting anything done.
In the event that you do get lucky and someone answers and then says they will ring you back about your query,then you may as well forget it!
Nine times out of ten they just don't bother to...despite their promises to do so..case in point, last Friday.. girl from the service department assured me that she would call me back the same day regarding a query I had about my new car..guess what?..didn't happen!...not that i was surprised! It's now 7days and not heard a thing from her..or anyone else from the dealership. I am really feeling that they don't deserve my custom anymore,shame as they are my nearest vw dealer."
2021-10-25,3,"Swift drop-off and collection of vehicle, the visual video analysis from mechanic is a fantastic touch and appreciated.
The loan vehicle was not suitable for customer use - bits of food, dirt, sticky marks and greasy fingerprints across the cabin and the steering wheel, that had to be cleaned before I continued driving home to an appointment. The 64miles of fuel dipped into 53miles by the time I reached the A44 and I do feel that a quarter tank would be more appropriate amount to be provided with and in-turn, to be returned from the customer with also."
2021-10-24,5,Completely happy with my car and the purchasing experience and was very smooth. Highly recommend Mr Philp Litchfield in Nottingham for the good customer service and his friendliness.
2021-10-23,1,"Inchcape rang me last week to arrange a VW service at Inchcape Cheltenham where we live. I was in Scotland when they called from (I believe) Inchcape in Chester. I said we were away and as I needed new wiper blades enquired about the cost for our 2014 VW Touareg. The caller (Lewis) informed me a pair of front wiper blades were £73 (£105.40 fitted) and the single rear blade £13.95 (£46.35 fitted) making a total of £151.75.
Because of the foul weather, I required them before driving over 300 miles down the M6/M5 motorways and visited the nearest VW garage: Wilsons Motors Ltd, 87 St Mary Street, Kirkcudbright, Dumfries & Galloway where a very helpful technician (Liam) fitted brand new Bosch wiper blades back and front in a couple of minutes free of charge - total cost £38.
INCHCAPE would happily charge me, and no doubt thousands of other loyal customers, four times this amount for doing the same job, even as part of a regular vehicle service!
After returning home to Cheltenham I rang Inchcape VW to check I’d not been mistaken with the prices mentioned over the phone and they confirmed the prices as being correct.
To me, this epitomizes rip-off Britain.
I happily left appreciative feedback on Wilson Motors (aka Rogerson Motors) website, having no inclination to do so for Inchcape where my monthly pension struggles to cover their monstrous prices.
You can probably guess who is least likely to sell me another car in the future?"

He helped me sort out an unexpected last minute hiccup, allaying all my fears and ensuring a smooth transition on the day. He also took the time to understand my needs and wants and to explain the array of new features on my new car. All in all a great experience which will ensure that my husband and I return for our future Mercedes purchases."
2021-10-13,4,very professional
2021-10-13,1,"I placed a reservation on a car 3/10 & paid £99. On 4/10, I realised the car had no current MOT so cancelled the reservation & requested a refund. I requested this again by email on 8/10 & then by telephone on 13/10. I was promised a return phone call from Adrian Day within 20 minutes, but when no call received after 2 hours, I submitted a formal complaint to Inchcape PLC."
2021-10-11,1,I'm amazed at the shocking level of service we received from a VW dealer! A car we purchased was advertised with features that were not actually present. We have been chasing for 4 months now for a resolution and getting nowhere. We are not looking into small claims court to resolve - that's where we are at. Really terrible service and not to be trusted. Dealt with Adrian Kimber and we wish we hadn't!
2021-10-11,5,Excellent service by the Sales Team in difficult circumstances.
2021-10-11,5,Great service. Very helfpul and friendly staff who explained everything required technically.
2021-10-11,3,"Love the car but unfortunately the collection felt unprepared. The salesmen didn't know where the car was and it took over 2 hours for hand over. wished it was a little more of a ""luxury"" experience overall."
2021-10-09,2,"Had my Xf sportbrake in Inchcape derby for service and first mot firstly I asked them to check stop/start it was on work to be done sheet but not on my invoice, I know why this is because it’s a fault with battery and because car is still under warranty until end of October and battery replacement would be free of charge.
Secondly when I got home and checked mot they have entered mileage wrong car has only done 14979 mot cert says 17979.
I have phoned derby and keep getting told someone from servicing will get back to me but I get no response"
2021-10-08,5,"Thank you Simon for making my experience amazing.
Professional, kind and patient"
2021-10-08,1,"If you like being let down like a slow releasing birthday ballon then come here, if not I would totally avoid.

I first looked to purchase my car in late April this year. I saw the car online and set off from Rotherham to Inchcape Altrincham, a some 100 round trip and 4 hours of my time.

When I arrived I was created by a salesman who I now know to be called Jordan. Jordan was superb and promised me the world on the car that I wanted to purchase and I felt reassured and happy that I had chosen the right company.

However, Jordan’s PROMISES are to be taken with a pinch of salt to say the least. I was let down three times by Jordan and this company no one seems to care?

BROKEN PROMISE #1
Having drove for the best part of an hour and a half we arrived and began to look at the car. The car was exactly what I wanted but had a few things that needed addressing. The car only had 5 months MOT remaining and as part of the deal I asked Jordan could I have 12 months on it. Jordan said yes. I later returned the following week with my girlfriend to collect the vehicle and asked Jordan had he done the MOT to which Jordan said yes, and that he even went into details how it went. I left that day thinking I had 12 months MOT on my car. HOWEVER! I later discovered a few weeks later that Jordan had straight up lied and broken his PROMISE, there had been no MOT done to the car. I contacted Jordan and inquired about this. He said that the only way he could sort it, is if I bring the car back and have the MOT done there. I said, why should I have to add 100 miles on to my car and waste a day for your incompetence and broken PROMISE? I said to Jordan that I could take it to a local recognised VW shop a few miles from my house to address the issue but this was not an option for him. Instead I have had to pay for my own MOT because of Jordan’s incompetence.

BROKEN PROMISE #2
When I attended the first time to see about the car, I test drove it and noticed that the air conditioning was making a funny noise and I was not happy about this. I spoke to Jordan and said, before I purchase this car I would like this issue addressing. Jordan once again PROMISED me that this would be addressed before I came to collect my vehicle in a weeks time. Once I collected the vehicle I asked had this been done? Jordan once again answered with a resounding YES!
However, this had not been done. I had been driving the vehicle a few weeks and noticed that the noise kept continuing, I phoned Inchcape up and we had the same conversation as the MOT. However, this time I just dealt with the matter myself and attend a garage to fix the issues. Another day wasted by Jordan’s broken PROMISE’s.

I have since hear that Jordan has ‘left’ the company and this is probably the most unsurprising thing of it all.


BROKEN PROMISE #3
Finally, I chose VW as I had been recommend them due to their customer care and their great warranties that they offer. So when I took my car a few months later to an independent garage (even though I should’ve had 12 months MOT on the car, but we can thank Jordan for that one). I found out that the welding on my exhaust needed replacing. I remember that I had 12 months Warrant with VW for issues exactly like this and contacted Inchcape regarding this matter as they had PROMISED this when I purchased my car. When I spoke to Inchcape they said yes this is covered under your warranty and even better I could take it to my local VW garage in Doncaster. I thought, well least 1 out of 3 issues being resolved is better than nothing. I then contacted Hayslden Doncaster and asked to book this in under my warranty only to be told…. This was not covered under my warranty and furthermore I would have to pay the privilege of £109 diagnostic fee to see if it is. Even thought the part in question is £50 and supposed covered under my warranty by VW as INCHCAPE by INCHCAPE.

Overall, I would avoid VW all together and would actively tell others to do the same especially at Inchcape. I have tried contacting several people within the organisation about this and no one seems to bothered and if they do ring you, it’ll be a few weeks on a random Tuesday after being PROMISED they’ll ring you back the same day…..

I hope that others that read this understand my frustration and look to go elsewhere and maybe for once the management will actually sort things with me after reading this. Having contacted head office of VW I have been told
to contact INCHCAPE directly to no success, but I hope some area manager in a office reads this.

2021-10-07,5,Brilliant service by Leon I bought the car by just looking at the pictures and the service which I got from him was brilliant when I came to pick the car up he also give excellent customer service and sorted everything out for me
2021-10-05,4,"Staff were very welcoming and made the handover day of my new car enjoyable. Very knowledgeable about the car and gave a thorough overview of all features. Sales assistant was easy to talk to and made my family and I feel very comfortable.

I gave 4/5 stars and not 5/5 as I felt the financial side of things wasn’t as transparent as it could have been for the part exchange, and the fine tuning of the figures to meet deposit/monthly payment values. On questioning something post purchase I was told I had been overcharged by £78 so I would have been out of pocket for this if I hadn’t prompted a revisit of the figures. I was given a £100 payment to cover this which did help for the inconvenience, but if the financial breakdown had been a bit clearer from the off I don’t think we would have had this issue."
2021-10-05,5,"Brilliant service, efficient but also I was made to feel very special.

Was delighted with my purchase and all the details were explained to me in layman's terms. Making things easy."
2021-10-04,3,"The dealership are very hard to get a response from. Service emails will take a week or more to get a reply from. If you call them you are in a queuing system for 30 mins plus.

On a recent fault visit they forgot to contact me - which led to me not being able to pick the car up and having it to stay overnight.

Very poor dealership for a prestigious brand."
2021-10-04,2,"While the staff at the Llandudno Junction branch were helpful, the system is now very poor. Over 20 minutes on hold to a central number. Then I gave up and booked online. Despite the 'service plan including a free courtesy car, the website wanted to charge £30 for the privilege. I emailed and over a week later, I still haven't had a reply. So eventually I organised a lift after dropping off, to get an email moving the date/time. No call to see if this was acceptable. So after going in and kicking off, the staff helped and squeezed the car in as originally booked. Then, they tried to charge for ad-blue over 10 litres (I was told this changed about 3 months ago, well after I took out the service plan). What is the point of a service plan that only covers 10 litres when the tank holds 25!! All in all, this is not what one expects from Mercedes. Very poor and I am considering if the service plan is worth it when the way Inchcape treat customers (not the local staff, who were excellent) and whether when the car is changed, using another dealer. Very disappointing."
2021-10-04,5,Nothing to complain about. Made to feel welcome and was offered a drink almost before I had time to sit down. Car serviced in about an hour or so and ready to go.
2021-10-04,3,"Attempted to book a service (Cheshire Oaks Mercedes) on the 'phone on a couple of occasions over a few days, before finally managing to speak with a booking 'clerk' to secure a mutually acceptable time & day. The electronic booking does not lend itself well to the needs of the user, outside of the 'norm' e.g, courtesy car requirements or customers with a service plan in place.
Upon arrival at the dealership, I was greeted by pleasant and courteous receptionists and directed to a seat to await a service department representative. Disappointingly, I was not invited or offered any coffee or tea (not that I wanted one) and noticed another customer helping themselves behind the 'staff only' counter area. I had to wait approximately 20 minutes to meet the service representative, though the delay was probably more my fault as I had arrived about 15 minutes early.
The vehicle health-check video was forwarded to my e-mail and is a helpful, reassuring feature and the subsequent text informing me that my vehicle was ready for collection, also helpful.
Upon arrival to collect my vehicle, I was again greeted courteously and pleasantly by the reception staff, with another wait of around 20-minutes. The service representative was also pleasant and courteous and outlined the work carried out to my car and returned my key to me.
The courtesy valet was disappointing - the car was vacuumed and cleaned on the outside but sadly the empty boot and interior of the windows were completely neglected - in contrast to other dealerships I've used previously"
2021-10-04,5,Simple drop off for MOT and pick up after. Fast attention on both occasions. Polite helpful staff.
2021-10-04,1,"If you intend dealing with these people, you need to be prepared to deal with issues like these. Note that I challenged each as and when they occurred and the response received was similar in all cases – that there is nothing they can do, it’s their policy or someone else (within Inchcape) sets the rules. In other words, it wasn’t just a bad day or a rogue employee. This is how they operate.
• When I expressed an interest in this car, they quickly changed the price and said it had been wrongly priced up and that this is unavoidable with such a large operation
• Part exchange valuations will be lower than the lowest end of any other scale you can find
• As part of their ‘offer’ they may try and offer a ‘specialist’ vehicle polish, which apparently has a market value. This will not be done and is worthless
• At vehicle collection, the body work/finish was actually worse than when I had chosen the car several days previously. This was only rectified after I returned on two additional occasions
• The original number plates were replaced with Inchcape branded plates so they can have some free advertising. This would be fine except were not properly secured - the plate was not screwed on via the original holes - so they fell off
• Despite having asked about the date of last service, it was not updated in the service manual. It was only updated after me asking
• I have doubts as to whether this service has actually been completed
• They agreed to complete the documentation necessary for me to get the V5 registration document. This involved a £25 fee. This was simply not done and several months afterwards I had to do this myself. They refused to reimburse me. They claimed their original cheque sent to DVLA had been returned shortly after they sent it – yet they didn’t tell me and I had to rectify and pay for this myself.

Good luck."
2021-10-01,4,It was my first visit to inchcape Land Rover Kings Lynn having recently moved from Kent. My discovery Sport needed it’s 1st MOT which was handled efficiently by the team.
2021-10-01,1,"I was looking for an used I-Pace and gave the sales guy at Norwich a list of requirements. In 3 months he only came up with one car that ticked hardly any of my boxes so I ended up buying a First Edition from Beadles Jaguar in Sidcup. The car hadn’t been properly checked by Beadles (that’s a whole other story) and I noticed an obvious fault on the drive home so I immediately phoned Inchcape Jaguar Norwich, my local dealer, to book it in. The soonest they could fit it in was 2 weeks away and in the meantime, another 2 other faults came to light. The car would intermittently not charge and the bonnet was very temperamental about closing properly, meaning I had to shut it several times to get the car to recognise it was shut, before I could lock the car. I phoned Inchcape Norwich the day before the car was due to go in and asked them if they could also look at these 2 issues and was told that they could only look at the issue I’d originally booked it in for as it was too late to add the extra problems to the job sheet! The best option they could offer was to rebook the car in the following week for all 3 issues to be addressed!

So a week later I go to pick the car up, they’d fixed the cruise control which was just a loose connection, adjusted the bonnet and diagnosed a fault with the 2KW charger that was supplied with the car as the cause of the charging issue. As they deemed that the charger was non-genuine they charged me £25 for the privilege and made a big thing of the fact that as a gesture of goodwill they had charged the car on their charger for me, when they’d actually only added about 40p of electricity! I explained that I was still waiting for a Pod-Point to be installed and that I needed to have some means of charging the car at home, and asked if they could lend me a charger. They said no and that they’d be unable to get me a new one for a couple of months. The guy, who had zero personality and zero empathy, then suggested, that we go to Lidl once a week and use their fast charger! I was absolutely infuriated by this attitude and got straight onto Jaguar Customer Services who sorted me out a new charger within a week.

A few days later I noticed that the panel gaps on the bonnet were all over the place so I phoned and booked the car in again (another 2 weeks) to get them corrected. In the meantime, the charging problem re-occurred so I phoned and was told that had been added to the job sheet. When I went to pick the car up from Inchcape Norwich, they’d not even looked at the charging issue as it wasn’t on the job sheet and the panel gaps were no better. I explained that I wasn’t happy with the panel gaps and the guy on reception went running off to talk to the ‘Master Technician’ who’d done the work. He reappeared 5 minutes later and told me that was the best they could do and if I wasn’t happy I needed to take the car to a body shop! Yet again, a really bad attitude and appalling customer service.

I ended up taking the car and extra 45 miles to Marshalls in Ipswich who re-aligned the bonnet to my satisfaction and diagnosed and fixed the charging issue (a faulty charge control module) so everything is now sorted. The whole experience at Marshalls was just so much better, all the staff were great and gave me the impression they actually cared and wanted to sort out the issues I was having with the car. Completely the opposite to Inchcape Norwich, who I won’t be using again."
2021-09-30,5,"Visited Inchcape Liverpool (Mercedes), sales staff were excellent and informative. Graham arranged for a vehicle to be brought in for us to test drive, along with an alternative should we dislike the original (at our request). On the day of the test drive both Graham and Georgia arranged for us to drive the alternative car without turning a hair, nothing was too much bother for them. We decided which car to buy and again nothing was too much trouble, the finance side was explained clearly by Sean and all paperwork for handover was completed seamlessly. Would I advise anyone to go to them for a car? Most definitely"
2021-09-29,5,"due to covid all online via telephone and email, absolutely fantastic! couldn't ask for better, highly recommend. Professional, courteous, thoughtful, the whole process was seamless and unpressurised. Thank you, would highly recommend and definitely use again."
2021-09-29,1,"My Partner and I recently visited BMW in Reading to look at a used BMW 1 Series (FG65 NWV)

We test drove the car and inspected it thoroughly before speaking to the sales man (Dan)

There were some issues with the car that bought up with the salesman and asked if they could be rectified as part of the deal if we bought the car. These included an updated Satnav System, Two new back tyres (to match the front tyres) and a full service. A full fank of fuel was also added to the list. As part of the deal we were to trade in our BMW X1 for £17,500

The salesman noted down all of the issues and then told us he would speak with the sales manager (Andrew). He returned stating that all of the issues had been agreed upon. We were happy with the deal that had been agreed, so gave a deposit of £500 and signed to buy the car.

Two days after this my partner was called by Dan who explained that they would no longer be changing the back tyres as there was nothing wrong with them.

The reason that I had asked that the tyres be changed is that one tyre was a run flat and the other side was a normal tyre as they are different designs. I then spoke to Andrew who said that the workshop had confirmed that all of the tyres are run flats and do not need to be changed. I explained to Andrew that I understood that the tyres may be the correct type but the other reason that I wanted the back tyres changed is that they are half worn and are different tread patterns across the axle and that I wanted them to be the same as the front tyres.

I explained to Andrew that even if the workshop had determined them to be fine, he had agreed to replace the tyres and had factored this into the deal that we had all agreed on.

Andrew was quite abrupt and argumentative on the phone and said that he would not chuck money at a car for no reason and that I had changed my reasoning for having the tyres changed and that I should be clear on the reason that I want them changed. He said that if it had to keep spending money on the car there would be no point selling it to us. The time of writing he has said that he will speak with the workshop and get back to me.

This conversation really annoyed and upset my partner and I, as we had worked hard finding the right car and deal and were expecting a BMW dealership to operate with some professionalism and also honour their word. We now feel that if that if the deal that we arranged, and the tyres are not changed we will take our business elsewhere and would advise others to do the same.

I have bought a car from this dealership in the past two years and was never been spoken to or treated like this before. My partner and I also felt ignored by the sales team when visiting the show room before agreeing on the sale and our phone calls regarding the car were not responded to. We thought perhaps we are being treated like this as the car is one of the cheapest in the showroom and we are worth less commission to the staff.

We collected the car on the 23rd September and handed over my X1. I was promised my £500 deposit back on the 22nd, its now the 29th and i have rang every day since chasing it. They have told me today that only yesterday they processed it and i will now have to wait 5-7 days for it. Everyone is extremely rude on the phone and interrupts me when im talking, telling me they cant help and its nothing to do with them even though they have sat on it for a week doing nothing.

There is never any apology and they don't seem to think its important. They were extremely persistent on my deposit being made immediately, but when i'm waiting for my money - they drag their feet never call back, and talk to me like an incompetent human being not worth their time. They just don't care. I'm still owed a part exchange fee of £4800 and no one will tell me when the paperwork was processed. They tell me they are busy not everyone is in and they will try and look and call back which they never do. Hense why i call them every day, and every day when I call their attitude gets worse as if i'm a pest just wasting their time.
This sales team is unprofessional and a shambles to deal with. Its the worse experience we have ever had with BMW.

When I signed paperwork to take my new car, i saw on a PRINTED piece of paper which they had completed on their computer system, one letter in my surname was incorrect, i mentioned it to Dan, and he said, ""well that's a fault that really should have been caught by you early on I don't know how to fix that now"" The team have my bank card, my driving licence with my name all over it so to say its a issue because of me was truly shocking and unacceptable . EVERYONE needs to work on their customer service skills in this department. If somethings an issue you don't blame the customer, you take it away and deal with it privately with your colleagues.

STAY AWAY FROM USED CAR SALES TEAM AT THE READING BRANCH."

2021-09-26,1,"Extremely disappointed with inchscape Cheltenham branch
Visited site initially on line, viewed a Range Rover sport (£30,115) which we were interested In Purchasing. Completed inchcape online valuation for our proposed Px which stated a fair price for VW Golf R. Spoke to sales team prior to visiting branch ( travelling from Northwich Cheshire to Cheltenham) to discuss availability and confirming quotation online.
After travelling for 2.5 hrs we arrived at the branch - no one came out to greet us, the vehicle was opened from inside branch and a test drive was given.
Then, once we returned we were invited in to discuss terms - the sale team firstly stated the quote on Line for part ex was inaccurate ( common problem they stated with their on line evaluations) and offered £1500 less than quoted - but failed to acknowledge their responsibility for notifying us of this important fact prior to visiting the branch, as we would not have travelled such a distance had they done so. Inchcape Cheltenham Would not negotiate price of the Range Rover to reflect revised px price offered stating the screen price was the price!!
We found the sales team to be arrogant and dismissive in manner given the time & expense we had given to purchase the Range Rover - needless to say confidence was lost and so was the sale. I have to say I have a long history as a repeat customer with Inchcape and have purchased many VW & Mercedes vehicles from both inchcape chester and Shrewsbury Mercedes and VW (7 cars in total) In the past and found previous experiences to be professional and courteous- this was not my experience with their Cheltenham branch - being fair, professional, honest and transparent was absent at team Cheltenham. This experience has tainted previously held positive regard I had for the brand and would think twice before considering inchcape in the future.

2021-09-25,5,"We bought our 3rd car through Phil Litchfield at the Nottingham branch last week. Every time Phil has been amazing and is available day and night. He even took calls from his hospital bed.
We ordered our latest car several months ago but it was delayed due to production issues. Phil kept us up to date throughout until we finally collected our new car last week. Absolutely worth waiting for."
2021-09-25,2,"Terrible customer service at the Shrewsbury branch. Made mistakes on the handover of our car and not told a few things we needed to know.
We checked the car was taxed as it was a demonstration model and it was taxed on direct.gov until next year but lo and behold we got a letter this morning from the DVLA informing us our new vehicle wasn’t taxed, I can only assume that they decided to claim the money back on the remaining months.
We have never had this happen before and feel like they just wanted the sale done and dusted with no proper communication at all."
2021-09-24,1,"Major problem and deceit (used to be good). In for a major service recently. Had written confirmation of parts and numbers to be used, instead they changed with the intention of using cheaper optifit which I declined extra works because of this. They also never changed the plugs and tried to blame the previous service company for missing them, I pointed out they were the previous service company. They also told me I needed Discs which it did not, and to change a shock absorber which it wasn't either. They have caused damage to the car and have requested photos that were sent. No response and despite chasing still no response. I have requested cancelation of contract and options, still no response. I will not likely return and await refunded monies and damages resolved. Probably end up having to go legal as they are not responding."
2021-09-22,3,"I recently bought a 3 year old transporter and I booked it in for a health check. After the health check the tech found that the auxiliary belt tensioner pully was making excessive noise and recommended it gets replaced. When I spoke to the service advisor about this as the van has 2 years extended warranty, he told me it will be OK and I should wait till it fails. I'm a bit unhappy as I have heard that if the pully fails and the auxiliary belt snaps then I can also cause damage to the timing belt cover or even worse the timing belt itself potentially causing catastrophic failure of the engine."

2021-09-20,5,"I have recently purchased an Electric Vehicle from Inchape Liverpool. I was quite uncertain about EVs initially but the sales guy, Jack was very patient and knowledgeable. He found answers to all my (many) questions. Nothing was too much trouble. Great service throughout."
2021-09-20,2,"My car had been there for nearly two weeks for some warranty work to be carried and oil service. To be fair, the faulty part had to be ordered, and I was given a loan car courtesy of Enterprise Car Hire. However, it was a piece of pants for a 69 plate with marks and small dents everywhere. I can't blame Inchcape for that, though.

1 - One of the jobs I requested was a 2021-3 Sat Nav update, but I was informed they couldn't do that as they don't have the latest map update from BMW. - I came home and downloaded it from the BMW website. It took me about an hour to do—no idea why they couldn't do this.

2 - When I collected the car after a week, the service indication was still on, so I had to wait for this to be updated. Apparently, this was due to the software being updated.

3 - A couple of days later, the same fault has come back on the car, and the warning light says, please call the nearest garage. I have left three messages with the advisor I was dealing with for over two days, still waiting for a callback.

They must be very busy as the phones ring for ages and sometimes get cut off when no one picks up.

Would I use them again.. probably not?"
2021-09-17,1,What a liberty taking. I found a lovely F Pace jag at Inchcape Derby and showed an interest in buying it but couldn't take it for a test drive as it hadn't been through their workshop. The car was advertised at a certain price on autotrader and although above my budget i had my heart set on the purchase. Five days later i was told it was ready for me to drive but on arrival the price of the car had been increased that morning after advertising it all week at one price. After a long conversation with the salesman he informed his boss that my interest in the car dated five days ago at the original advertised price but he was told i could not have the car at the original advertised price..i was gutted as they had added another £600 on the car and i had to walk away in disgust and disappointment. I feel that changing the price at the last minute and expecting me to pay the increase was certainly taking advantage and i will certainly be staying away from Inchcape and so will my friends in future as it seems that they do not value their customers.

2021-09-14,1,"Went to my local Swindon Audi and found a car I wanted, spoke with the salesman for 30-40 mins, went for a test drive, spoke about the minor things which would be touched up, some rubber matts and worked out how much my old car would be in part exchange... then, I calculated the difference in my head of the price clearly displayed on the windscreen, turns out they had increased the price twice, neither time updating the windscreen so as a normal customer I was mislead into thinking this was the selling price. turns out they had increased the price by £2,000 in only 2 weeks... they refused to budge on price despite the fact their method was in clear contradiction of trading standards (it even lists this as an example)..."
2021-09-13,5,"Only one thing i notice, when i did ask about the courtesy car and i have been told this straight away - ""If i give you courtesy car now and we have about 20 booking a day and everyone ask for courtesy car so we do not have left, so no we do not have available"" - this was sudden response to me when i mention ""do you provide courtesy car? anyway this is not a complaint i like the service, just felt that if i have informed earlier via conversation on the phone i would take those offer as i live quite far Ascot to Guildford and I'm running my business operations while im waiting outside close by the garage in Inchcape Guildford. but overall was good as they fixed it on the day."
2021-09-13,5,Mr Alex did a fantastic job in finding my new car.
2021-09-10,1,"Paid for the pickup-and-delivery option for a service at Inchcape Guildford. Quite expensive service costs. They rang to inform us the work was complete and asked us to pay, which we did, and they confirmed it would be returned today (Friday).We have a day-trip planned with 3 kids tomorrow morning, requiring packing car this evening. 22:00hrs now and still no car. Garage closed and no way to find out where the vehicle is. We will not be able to go on the planned day-trip tomorrow. Terribly disappointed and frustrated. Kids will be more so. No doubt apologies may be made tomorrow - possibly even that they'll use this feedback to improve their customer service in future (see their website) but they won't actually care about the impact that this poor service has."
2021-09-10,5,Excellent great service had a problem with my car all sorted would recommend many thanks
2021-09-10,1,"Customer not informed about the service completion. Entered incorrect customer details in the system, blaming customer, talking rudely with customer and covering their mistakes."
2021-09-09,1,"Tried booking my F-Type in for a service at Jaguar Norwich, I was told it would be for 1 hour. I wanted to drop off at 9.00 am and collect car before 2 pm as not local and needed to be back by 3.00pm. Was told can only book in and leave the car from 9-6 or you can wait for two hours only from 2.00pm which would not work. I had no date restraints on when service can be booked in for , was promised a call back to book in did not call back , called again was promised they would call back ,did not call back again !, called again (third time !) and they called back to say you can book for a sat morning service is 9-12 three hours! but could not book this during the week!! dropping off at 9 for collection at 2.00 that's 5 hours ! what so no appointments for the rest of this year ?? asked to speak to service manager Mark Swift , never called back! the worst service I have ever experienced just trying to book a service . How difficult can it be ? I would not recommend under any circumstances ."
2021-09-08,5,I found the approach and interaction most personable and I must say the whole atmosphere in the dealership should be recommended and was the best experience I have had to date in a BMW dealership. The reception staff were personable and not aloof and the whole atmosphere was one of calm and not frenetic as experienced in other dealerships. If you were more local to my home base I would definitely utilise your services for regular support of my vehicle.
2021-09-07,5,My Mercedes CLS was booked in for a repair involving a replacement bumper. The whole process was handled by Paul Cooper who provided a very professional level of attention to my job. Courtesy car handover was quick and easy. I was concerned about colour matching but the final result was perfect. Overall the process was excellent.
2021-09-07,5,"My car needed body repairs, servicing and MOT. All was carried out. My only concern was when I checked my tyre pressures all my tyres were inflated to 3.5 mb (55psi) instead of 2.7mb (40psi) as stated on the servicing check list. I deflated them to the correct pressures and inform the servicing department of this in case the pressure regulator used to inflate my tyres needed recalibrating. Apart from that everything the garage and bodyshop did was excellent."
2021-09-06,5,"My experience throughout the purchase of my Lexus RX was one of complete satisfaction.
I was introduced to all the senior managers who confirmed my purchase to be one of quality, reliability and continuous support.
Special thanks to Sales Executive, Elly Power who is a pleasant, experienced and knowledgeable lady who is a credit to Lexus Derby.
I look forward to many years of trouble free motoring with the knowledge that the smallest of issues would be rectified by a first class team at Lexus Derby."
2021-09-06,5,"From start to finish, the service I received was excellent. Mark Jeffery was my contact point throughout. He answered all of my BMW-based questions fairly and in detail (there were many, as I had been a long-term Mercedes Benz user), without the burden of sales patter or 'steering' me to gain a sale. The whole buying experience (of an approved 4 series) was completed with an assured confidence that I appreciated as a business professional. Mark even went the extra mile to accomodate my timing needs, enabling me to collect the vehicle to suit my schedule rather than his own. I am now enjoying my BMW, a great choice!"
2021-09-03,5,My car was collected and returned after service. Everything was satisfactory.
2021-09-02,1,"SLOPPY, UNCONCERNED SERVICE, AVOID!!

Our car smelled strongly of raw diesel fuel after being serviced. A good amount had been spilled onto the engine for some reason. Their 'health check' wrongly stated that we needed an immediate brake fluid change when it did not - they not tested the fluid and misread the service log. On calling them about these issues they seemed totally unconcerned. After spending over £700 we are naturally appalled and very disappointed with Inchcape Shrewsbury and will go elsewhere next time."
2021-09-02,1,"To Whom it may concern,

We bought our first EV car EQC400 from Mercedes Coventry. We had 2 sales person involved as 1 had left and the transitioning to another sales to take over the sale was appalling. The lack of communication to pass on my details to another salesman about the sale , as I already knew the first Sales man was leaving, I was calling up many times to see when my car was arriving and enquiring about the EV charging etc and getting back to me took a few days. Eventually the 2nd salesman called and thought I was only enquiring about EV Charging on the EQC 400, but then he understood that I had already ordered the Car !
Although 2nd Salesman was a nice guy But unfortunately he does not know much about the car I purchased or know anything about EV cars at all ! I had to do a lot of research about the car and the options on the car I have with Mercedes Me online and YouTube.
Even the car had arrived, I was not been notified by the 2nd Salesman and he assumed that I had already arranged to pick up my car from the 1st Salesman.
I as a customer had to chase and call almost every day to the salesman has the car arrived ? as it had supposed already arrived on a certain date.
This is my 4th Mercedes from Coventry Inchcape , the last 2 times of sales is not up to standard and disappointed as I had to find out more about the car and do all the chasing around. This could be my last Mercedes from you in Coventry Inchcape.
As the car industry in EV is moving forward rapidly, I would advise the sales team to improve on their Sales , customers services and knowledge about EV cars especially ! As I don’t think they have had any training on EV Mercedes.

Regards

Ken Tsang"
2021-09-01,1,"I recently bought a Mercedes from the dealership in Leicester and was very disappointed with the post sales customer service. The salesman lost his initial level of helpfulness once the car was sold, which reflects very poorly. I asked to be shown some features in the car and received a rushed overview and was told to go look online. After having looked online and following up with a few Q's, I have received no response. This is very disappointing customer service, given Mercedes's status as a luxury car brand."
2021-09-01,3,"I attended BMW after seeking a diagnostic test on my steering which I felt had play in it. They checked the car. They could find no steering issue but told me that my two rear tyres were bald the cord was showing. They said they could source two tyres but it would not be ready until Saturday. I could not wait long, so had to get the tyres sourced elsewhere. I went to a tyre specialist, they told me the cord was not showing and the tyre was low not bald. They were relatively new tires, less than 6 months old. Pot holes and what nots are the course of the issue I am told, which may have misaligned my tyres.

So when I went in to collect my car I was not expected to wait for half an hour. After the first 20 minutes I returned to reception believing I may have been forgotten. The salesperson was on the telephone. He kept me waiting another 10 minutes after that. When he arrived, he was totally unapologetic. No apology at all. He was not unkind or unpleasant just did not tell me he was sorry for keeping me waiting for half an hour. Really disappointed by the way I was treated. I had far better things I could have been doing, the lack of value for my time was surprising. I have been a BMW customer for years, I had come to expect high standards of customer care, this was by far the worse experience I had in more than a decade…I felt like the invisible women. No one wants to feel like that. Come on BMW you can do better than this…"
2021-08-31,5,Excellent Teamwork and also always kind and very helpful as well.
2021-08-30,5,Top class service trying up my older C-HR for the new GR Sport. Melissa was simply excellent from start to finish and top dealership.
2021-08-30,5,Great service. Helpful staff .
2021-08-29,1,"Absolutely abysmal company! This is directed towards Inchcape Mercedes. I started looking into buying a car as I love cars so I find a car which ticked most of my boxes. I want to try before I buy so I phone up the Mercedes dealership and book and appointment for a test drive as they had 24hr test drives on at the time. I say I just want to test and have a look at both new and used for the best deal. I get to the dealership for a test drive and the guy sits me down without even introducing himself and starts speccing a new car to order which confused me so after a few questions I said wait I only want to test drive and see if I want one first so he’s like fine. Puts my details In the system and tells me I’m too young for the insurance so he will have to contact head office which will take a couple of days. After a few cancellations and days later I finally get a test drive and loved the car. I get back and tell him I want to get one but it will probably be a used one as I’ve looked at the deals myself and that’s what makes most sense to me so he says fine. I tell him what I want and he says he will call when one comes up. Never heard from him again. Went to another Inchcape to test drive a specific used car I’m interested in. I turn up and the guy tells me it’s been sold so I made the 45 min journey for nothing. He seemed like a decent chap apart from him being completely useless so I told him what I wanted and again he said he’d contact me when one comes up. It’s been almost a year now. I’ve since bought one from a private seller and sold for £3k profit after putting 5k miles on it so I suppose I can’t complain. I don’t know if it was because I was a cash buyer that they didn’t car or because I was 21 and they didn’t believe I could afford one but whatever it was, was very unprofessional. I will never use an Inchape ever again. when I had my Mercedes I drove further away to get it serviced at an LSH rather than going to this awful company! (LSH was also cheaper on all services)"
2021-08-27,1,I had my car serviced a couple of days ago. The map update is not at the latest level. I tried to phone their service desk and was told someone would call me back - 25 hours later and no one has. I filled in their web request form to complain and no one has contacted me. Terrible communication and poor customer service so far from them
2021-08-27,5,"Went into Chelmsford BMW to look at a used M2, great service, I usually buy Mercedes and haven’t bought a BMW for years but I found the service in BMW much better than Mercedes."
2021-08-27,1,"I brought my car in for its annual service and MOT and it failed because the nearside indicator repeater (the extra indicator on the wing mirror) wasn't working and I was told you couldn't get the part for a few weeks so to go away and try to get it fixed somewhere else. That is appalling customer service. The least you could have done was pass its MOT for such a ridiculously insignificant fault, order the part and I would have brought it back to be fixed when the part came in. What am I supposed to do when my current MOT expires? This is completely unreasonable. I have a car that I can't drive because Mercedes failed it on its MOT and then hasn't got the ability to fix it. It's disgusting service."
2021-08-24,2,"Bought a new Golf from inchcape Stockport; sales went fine & I was told they undertook a 150 check on the car that gave confidence it was fine. Went on holiday in the car & day 2 it broke down in Kent! 500mls on the thing & it stopped. Called out VW out who said the battery had been changed at some time but no record of the change. The battery had NOT been coded to the vehicle & the main charging wire not connected so the vehicle didn’t know what the battery was! The whole car had to be reset before it would work. It took 2 hours from arrival to sort it out & get it working! The attending engineer was very helpful & courteous & couldn’t do enough for us. However, the experience has let me thinking I won’t be buying another car from them. I would expect a car with 500mls on the clock to actually work! How on earth they checked any of the 150 items w/o a battery is beyond me. I expect they were lying & didn’t actually check anything. I was robbed of a day’s holiday because of this incident."
2021-08-24,1,"Had MOT,Service and Brake Fluid change 17/08/2021. Just realised that I have been charged £150.00 twice.
Visited showroom today at 09:30 to try and get money back. The staff assured me that they would call me at home to arrange the return of the incorrectly taken second amount. Payment would be refunded into my account in 3-5 working days. It’s 15:30, no call from dealership. Why should I wait for my money."
2021-08-24,5,"Ist class service from reception through to service from Tom Smith in purchasing our new car.
Friendly atmosphere all round.🙂"
2021-08-24,5,"Very good experience found out more was wrong with my car than first thought, they video the work that needs doing so you can see love that, the guy in charge of service was very helpful and found me a car to use while mine was fixed, bonus it was a supra will definitely be using again"
2021-08-23,5,Excellent service
2021-08-22,1,"The place I was told I could sit and work while I wait was directly under a speaker from which music was being played. The receptionist refused to turn it down sufficiently because she wanted “atmosphere” in the showroom. It was empty. I was the only customer.
The service took an age and two of the problems were not dealt with because they said they didn’t have time to look at it. I’d have to come back. Never going back to this dealer again."
2021-08-20,5,I am so pleased with the amazing service from start to finish.I will definitely be coming back for servicing. Thank you so much for fitting my car in same day. Then also arranging for the diamond cut alloy wheels to be professionally refinished. They look amazing! You really look after your customers - huge thank you to you all.
2021-08-19,1,"This relates to Inchcape Jaguar Norwich. Two years ago bought an F-type from them despite a friend warning me about the appalling service. Sales experience was fine but the service department were appalling. Completely ignored emails and requests for attention to specific issues with the car. I had to involve the Sales manager in order to get a response. After profuse apologies from the business last year regarding my experience was hoping for improvement this year but two days after my email was sent requesting service dates - no response again. When i phoned up the receptionist seemed to imply that because the service manager got a lot of emails it was better to phone -ie. i should not really expect a response. i think that says it all. If it was not for a concerning issue with the car which i feel should have been dealt with last year and was not, i would have gone elsewhere and once that issue is resolved i shall vote with my feet."
2021-08-18,5,"It was a very good experience at Mercedez. Having met Phil the experience became even more wonderful.He was very humble , very helpful. He helped us right from the beginning till the very end, excellent service, very quick. I would definitely recommend Phil to my friends for any assistance ."
2021-08-18,5,"My car needed an MOT with collection and delivery, as I'm limited in my ability to stand or walk. I called in to M-B Southport and made a convenient appointment. The Service Department phoned me to confirm the time the day before. My car was collected on time and returned having been cleaned. Excellent service, as always."
2021-08-17,5,"From the day I walked into the showroom to the day I collected the car, the service from Tim was excellent, kept me informed throughout the process and even though the extra part was not fitted the handover to service was excellent."
2021-08-17,5,"I had a very positive experience with everyone at Inchcape Warrington, Sam the sales person was professional and knowledgeable, a joy to deal with. Very please with the service I received and when I'm looking to replace my car they will be my first choice."
2021-08-17,5,"Speedy First class service with regular updates on what needed to be done and duration. I was well taken care of throughout my wait, able to continue working via laptop with minimal disruption to my day.
Best thing, my car was returned fully cleaned in and out and left feeling reassured."
2021-08-16,5,"My car was in for its first service, it was discovered that a tyre was damaged, but covered by my tyre insurance. A tyre was sourced and fitted and claimed on the insurance on my behalf all during the period when the car was at the dealership for the service. First class care!"
2021-08-16,2,"Disappointed, to say the least. Expected a lot from Lexus, and I have been left with a bad taste in my mouth.

Between broken promises, and a poor car-retrieval process, I'm disappointed to have experienced such dire service, when I've heard so many good things about Lexus.

I really wanted things to go well, but it just didn't. I'm in the process of complaining officially, and I will hopefully see if things can be turned around."
2021-08-16,5,Large dealership that provides excellent service and completes work on time. Vehicle always returned cleaned inside and out and does not overcharge.
2021-08-13,5,"I took my car into Inchcape JLR service centre last week. They provided me with a courtesy car, which was very new and very clean. They had a list of jobs to carry out on my vehicle under warranty. It took a little longer than anticipated due to parts availability.
I was kept informed right through the process. John (service advisor), and Jamie (parts) were both very professional.
My car came back with all the required work completed, and it was lovely and clean.
It's a shame that other dealers cannot be so professional. The purpose-built service centre is way better than any other JLR dealer in the south.
I travel over 80 to take my vehicle to Inchcape, with at least 4 other dealers closer to me.
One day other dealers will build service centres away from their showrooms, where parking is not an issue.
Thank you Inchcape."
2021-08-12,1,"- Missing service history book, the sales didn't mention why it is missing in the car nor reply to my email of enquiry regarding the missing service book

- The car was with privacy tinted glass showed on the picture but both rear windows were missing during the date of collection. Although the reason was understandable, the salesman didn't inform me before I found out after the test drive. I felt a bit unhappy to trust this dealership again. As if 'don't tell if they (customer) didn't notice"" I picked the car because knowing having privacy glass is one of the desirable features. When asked if I can get a little discount because of the missing feature, I was told that I could just leave and not take the car. I have travelled 3+ hours on public transport to get the car from a Toyota dealership hoping everything will be alright. The vehicle was the cheapest car from the lot I understand, I hope it is understandable that I am also paying considerably more than a local private seller because I am buying it from a Toyota dealer.

To be fair, the salesman did explain the situation and I appreciated that. Just unfortunately a 'good' thing he did for me turned into such a bad experience for my side. I also appreciated the full tank of petrol supplied from the dealer."
2021-08-11,5,"I recently took my car in for its service at Inchcape Colchester. From calling in to seeing when I could get my car booked in to when I collected the car the customer service was excellent. To add to this, there was a fault with my washers jets and Jade has now managed to get that booked in soon so that it can be fixed. All round I can’t complain at all. My only grudge might be that it wasn’t very well polished after it’s been cleaned but there we go."
2021-08-11,1,"I've recently purchased a used C350e at the M-B of Coventry (Inchcape). The sales assistant Aqeem was thoroughly unknowledgable about the car, making stuff up on the go and presenting it as facts, while it was often wrong.
Aqeem did nor respond to any of 3 emails I've sent him regarding clarification of the purchase process.
My purchase was subject to a specific delivery date which was confirmed several times including the afternoon before delivery. At the scheduled time of delivery I was called that ""car still needs to go to body shop"" and will be delivered 3 days late.
Eventually car was delivered without floor mats, Aqeem and his manager claim the car comes without floor mats. Somehow I do not believe that a car that would cost £50k+ new as it is essentially full-spec does not come with floor mats, but I might be wrong.

After escalating this they did give me 2 years of free servicing, but I would still prefer to buy a car from people who are competent, respond to queries and don't mislead me."
2021-08-05,5,"New GLA 250e from Nottingham my 3rd new Mercedes from them and the usual great service especially from Phil who managed our expectations with the current delivery delays outside the dealerships control.
And patient handover with great follow up.
Love the hybrid which is amazing. Thanks"
2021-08-05,5,"I bought a new Smart from Phil at Mercedes-Benz of Nottingham. The whole process was remote (I live 130 miles away) and followed an email enquiry I made through their website.

It was hugely impressive. After a short introductory call, Phil was responsive, communicative and arranged finance and delivery of the vehicle efficiently and quickly. He was a pleasure to deal with and by far the best car salesperson I have dealt with."
2021-08-03,5,"Service sight inspection was completed within the 1.45 hours designated time complete. Small defect noted and as I had just purchased the car from elsewhere I wanted to go on the service, mot and breakdown plan. This was brilliant news Colin communicated excellently and Tom sent in video all happy days."
2021-08-01,5,"Customer service that I received was brilliant. Even when I’d taken the car away, and found an issue with the air con, Angel organised not only to have it collected from my place of work, with a backup car for my commute - but had my car back next day. Wouldn’t hesitate to purchase from here again, I was well looked after."
2021-07-29,5,"We had to use Inchcape in Altrincham after my wife's car broke down on the M6. They could not have been more attentive and efficient.

The issue was diagnosed quickly and we were comfortable with their opinion as it was a recurring issue and despite staff shortages due to ""pinging"" they sorted the vehicle out in 48 hours.

We were very grateful and could not have been more impressed. A rare experience in today's world."
2021-07-29,1,"Inchcape Mercedes North Wales - in particular the accounts debt provided shocking service. Put down a £99 refundable deposit to hold a car pending viewing which I decided not to proceed with on the Monday. Chased up the refund after no receipt the following Friday, and it then took a further 5 days to actually get confirmation the the refund has been processed! Now to wait for the actual money back - up to 10 days apparently!!"
2021-07-29,1,"Inchcape Land Rover Guildford is just a joke. Servicing is completely incompetent. Been 4 times to identify and repair the vibrations. So far the spend is £3000. I believe it is because Inchcape company value to its staff is about how the make the bill the most expensive. I had to take over as they were just taking my wife to cleaners. Once they know there is a problem, they dont call you, return calls. In fact, I cannot get my car back after almost 2 weeks. This company has no complaints handling procedures! Be very vigilant when using this garage as the front office staff have no experience and you are taken for a ride in terms of servicing. You cannot give them your TRUST."
2021-07-28,5,"Went looking for a used car for my son which we viewed from the website and ended up buying a different vehicle which was recommended by Rob and it was perfect!

Rob was great in terms of explaining the history and spec of the vehicle, his knowledge around finance etc and all round great customer experience.

A great experience all round and would definitely recommend this dealership if buying a used car."
2021-07-27,1,"A job that was scheduled for one day took over a week.
Still have no idea what works have been completed on the vehicle.
No handover or paperwork was provided on collection.
Despite waiting on feedback for over 40 minutes the feedback that was provided was incorrect on each of the 5/6 occasions a member of staff came back to me, so I gave up and left.
I am still waiting on a call to explain what works were done to the vehicle."
2021-07-27,5,"Really good service, problem diagnosed quickly and explained to me in a away I could understand no jargon. Really friendly staff."
2021-07-26,1,"I had a bad experience buying the car from Inchcape preston.I have planned to buy the car without visiting the show room and also it was quite far from my house. The car was delivered to me with scratch at the back. The delivery man advised me that sales specialist 'Emily Day' already seen the issue before the delivery but Emily did not bother to call me back before the delivery. Otherwise they have to pay £250 extra delivery charge to the third party. Another issue was, one of the panel of the car fell off while driving. I have noticed that some hook was missing from the panel. Helen (Manager) was helpful to sort the issue but my question is why I need to go through all the problems when I bought the car from a approved dealer which cost me nearly more than £35K. The wheel is nearly old and therefore I had to fix one wheel from a garage already . According to the garage,It meet the legal standard but I need to change all four wheels anytime soon. I advise all ,please do not buy car without visiting the show room. Please check everything before buy"
2021-07-26,5,"Excellent service by Inchcape Basingstoke, especially the lady in the service department deserves 5 stars. My car MOT has failed but she managed to get the insurance approved and get the car ready the next day without paying any penny. Highly appreciate your service. Thanks"
2021-07-25,1,"Extremely poor service from start to finish with Audi Inchcape Swindon, business only concerned with hitting targets and zero care for customers. Most recent issue left me and the 2 kids on a birthday weekend with no car, because of another fault with the car and an issue at Audi / Inchcape, 3 hours of phone calls later and no-one could help. Comments being we are short staffed and I’m dealing with customers in store…… no-one answering phones either! Not only an issue over the weekend, but I travel for work and was expected to be on site on Monday morning. Which due to their total incompetence means my whole diary has had to be reshuffled at late notice. Not impressed and won’t be buying another Audi from Inchcape"
2021-07-25,1,"Bought a brand new car which was handed over damaged, tried to resolve with dealership but a number of issues are still present. Advised nothing more can be done to resolve and either to accept, reject or complain to the brand. Extremely disappointing customer service & experience."
2021-07-23,1,"Inchcape Colchester worst car dealer ever, bought a 2 year old 5 series from them just over two years ago, last few month I started to notice the paint is coming off on the two driver side doors, someone pointed out to me that the doors may not be the original or had been repaired, but whoever repaired the doors did a terrible job as it did put the Lacquer layer before painting over them. So today I took the car back to them and mentioned that the car may be a damaged car, and guess what they said, yeah exactly what you'd imagine a bad dealer would say. The sales manager told me ""we don't cover this because it is outside warranty period"", and the custom service manager told me ""the car didn't have this issue when I took the car"".
Will never use them again."
2021-07-23,1,"Guildford dealership contacted me initially to book my car in for a free ‘software’ update. When I questioned this I was told it was for ‘power steering bolt’. They had my car for a full day in order to carry out the work. I picked my car up and when I looked at the paperwork it appeared that no work had been done, although I didn’t understand the terminology used. When I rang / emailed and asked for clarification the same phrase as was used on the invoice was simply repeated. I asked for further clarification and was simply told that the car was inspected. I now see in the media that LR is recalling Evoques of my age to change the steering bolt. Now I am concerned that my car is faulty and no one is prepared to give me the facts. So from the initial contact to now everyone has been trying to hide the facts."
2021-07-23,5,Bought a used Polo here in May 2021 with good customer service from sales. Just spoken to James in the service team to check my 2 years warranty. James was really helpful; confirming all in order & providing additional information on how things work. Really personal & friendly guy who was really helpful. Good work VW Exeter team.
2021-07-22,3,"We purchased a three and a half year old Jaguar F Pace in May 2021, the first issue of having no Air-Con was sorted out fairly quickly about 3 weeks, and took a day, although i had to persevere to get a courtesy car. Other issues are sorted out when head of sales Darren Poole got involved to which I am grateful, it is now late August and hopefully when I get my car back after 10 days which includes warranty work it will be ok."
2021-07-21,1,"Very disappointed with this dealership, had a coolant leak in car for many months, took it to dealer multiple times to figure out the problem, was advised that if theres no warning lights it will be ok to drive, i kept topping up the coolant myself, i took it again for the 4th time for same issue, and finally they found the problem and replaced the leak in intercooler! During this visit, my seat which admittedly had a slight damage, was damaged further in another part, the dealership took no responsibility and offered a small discount to repair (over £500) very disappointed in this dealership as this is where i bought my car from and the sales team were very good! Will be taking my car elsewhere for service!"
2021-07-21,5,"I was treated like royalty when I went to see Phil Litchfield to choose my new car it was his knowledge and personal care that made me return to Mercedes
He did everything possible to help me choose the right car for me
I took delivery of the car yesterday and again Phil paid attention to explain the new system to me even going over again things I’d misunderstood
He’s patience is amazing
Thank you so much Phil for everything you’ve done for me p"
2021-07-20,1,Bought a brand new £120k car at end of 2020. Service from salesman dreadful. Who knew that you could disregard a sale of £120k during COVID times?! Speechless tbh! After sales just as bad. Car has been nothing but problematic since. No return of calls from Head of Sales (J Hudson). Absolute joke. They take your money and provide zero customer care. Don't waste your time. Worse than 'Bodge It & Scarper' roadside car sales. A dreadful JLR franchise! Worst British car manufacturer's advert ever - FACT!
2021-07-19,5,"We had a very positive experience buying a used car from the Liverpool Branch.
David Sherwood was excellent - really helpful (under very trying COVID circumstances) in enabling us to pick up the car at very short notice. The transaction was totally seamless thanks to David really putting himself out to make it happen for us."
2021-07-19,1,"Sold a car being told had full service history and1 previous owner. Once picked up and given access to VW app and received V5 this was not the case. Raised concern and told it did have full service history as they had completed a full service before delivery and it was obviously 1 owner plus the last one! Really?
The managers just lied and when escalated originally said could have money back but they had already sold my car on so that would have left me without car,
Not happy but as they assured us all OK and all servicing up to date, went with it.
Now I've gone to book in for service and now being told by same dealer that it needs Major service as only did minor pre delivery!!
Maybe it's me but Main means complete/Major not just an oil change.
Totally appalling management and customer service. If could have given zero stars I would and would recommend others go else where for their car purchase and avoid or ensure all details provided on their website and by staff are checked before agreeing to purchase."
2021-07-19,5,When the A/C on my Corolla failed Andrew Robey arranged for the repair to be done in good time even though the workshop was very busy. All completed under warranty.

2021-07-19,5,Excellent service from Mercedes Benz when delivering my new vehicle. The delivery driver was excellent at the handover with clear explanation of the car's functions
2021-07-19,5,"Fantastic Customer service and awesome experience, Craig Jamieson made the process quick and simple and I got a very good deal for a very nice car. Thanks Craig for all the extra assistance and of course he's manager John. I will recommend Mercedes Benz of Liverpool, they offer great customer service and good deals."
2021-07-16,1,"My partner paid an online deposit of £250 to reserve a car from Jaguar Land Rover Chester
5 days later she was called from the dealership to inform her nonchalantly that the car had been sold to someone else….. it’s a week ago today and no sign of her deposit being returned and I called Inchcape Chester and spoke with one of the many managers… forget his name…. However he promised to get to the bottom of it on Tuesday….. it’s Friday and he hasn’t bothered to phone back! Charlatans do not give them your business!!!
Three weeks later still not had deposit returned and can’t get an answer from them!
I see they are so up themselves that they never respond to anyone else on head either!!!
Disgusting suit wearing nobodies"
2021-07-15,5,MOT and annual service efficiently done.
2021-07-13,5,"I have just purchased a car from inchcape, used car centre Burton, the service provided was fantastic and I felt confident purchasing from them. Before viewing the car, I was sent a personalised video of the car which was a great touch, especially as I was driving over 100 miles to view the car. On the day of viewing the car, Carl took the car down from auto trader and was very accommodating as they had other people show interest in the car. On the day of purchased myself and my partner received amazing services - Liam Tilley was very professional & patient throughout the whole process. He went through the whole process step by step and ensured I was aware of what was happening. He even went the extra mile and personally got a stain out of one of the seats, which he didn't have to do! The company provides excellent warranty which I extended for only an extra £20 a month. I would definitely recommend Inchcape, used car centre Burton & can't thank the team enough for their patience and help during the whole process. Thank you to the whole team & an extra thank you to Liam Tilley."
2021-07-12,5,Excellent service. Tam was very professional and supportive.
2021-07-12,1,"Very disappointed with inchcape vw Stockport, I purchased a nearly new car from this branch in January 2021 I bought the car as advertised with 2 keys, the day before I was due to pick up the car I was told one of the keys wasn't working, the salesman told me I could wait for the 2nd when they ordered it, or pick the car up and wait a week or so for the key to arrive and they would contact me. It's now July 2021 and no key, after numerous emails and telephone calls and promises they would get back to me no one has, I even asked for the manager to contact me but never did even though I was promised every time by the receptionist, it never happened, so basically if you have a problem with this company and their employees there response is to completely ignore you and hope you go away, you may think I'm over reacting but when you spend over £20,000 on a car and the new key costs £240 and you were promised it, I will never deal with this company again as I've dealt with plenty of car sales companies and never been treated so appallingly by the sales team I needed to write a review to warn other interested parties to go else where, I am also writing reviews on other sites as I feel they should not be allowed to get away with this.

2021-07-12,1,Huge problem with communication… I didn’t receive my V5 Logbook on time because it wasn’t issued from you for 2 months since I have bought a vehicle! I had send lots of emails and asked lots of questions about different thinks and I felt like nobody cares to respond me… nobody informed me that my car have no service book and you ‘looked’ for it for a month until I called one time and asked somebody else and I get info that you never had it… really I thought it is a good idea to buy warranty for a year but I have a feeling that was waisting of money… I am sorry but every contact with you was just a one huge disappointment! I will not recommend this dealership to anyone
2021-07-12,1,"I have raised a complaint directly to Ichcape for Mercedes-Benz of Stratford-Upon-Avon due to cumulative issues, but neither after a month I've got no answer. I want to mention that the complaint was raised directly to their seniors level but still no interest in sorting out any issue i had, or either to talk with me so i can explain everything... I will AVOID this company from now on. They don't respect the customers in any way. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
2021-07-10,5,"I'm not from Nottingham but went to mercedes Nottingham because I didn't feel like the Derby branch didn't cared about what I was looking for. Throughout the hole process Phillip Litchfield was amazing from customer service to any concerns I had, he made the hole process of actually getting the car easy I would have loved to thank him in person at the car handover but because of a back injury he wasn't there.
If anyone wants a car Phillip Litchfield is the person to speak to."
2021-07-09,5,From the first moment that I have stepped into the dealership until the moment that I have left with my new car I have felt valued. Douglas and Iain never pushed me and always tried their best to make my experience better. The most important for me is that they have not pushed for something I did not want or could not afford . I definitely hope my relationship with Toyota will continue like that!

2021-07-09,1,"Please think twice before using Cooper BMW in Chelmsford. I am sure they will fall over themselves to sell you a new car but there after sales is shocking. They look to avoid blame with no compromise even when customers are being reasonable, no return of emails or calls.

Appalling service from a highly regarded brand, BMW need to take a hard look at who is representing them !!"
2021-07-08,1,"Got given my car back with a crack in windscreen. When i enquired, got told ""it can't have been us, we have no stones on our premises !"" 🤔 so i have to deal with it myself 🤐
Normally it's a 5 Star experience at this site, so it's a shame.."
2021-07-08,1,"When I booked my service it was on a ‘while you wait’ basis. I was advised these usually takes about two hours and I’ve used them before and found them great. I arrived shortly before my appointed time, handed over my keys and advised the sunroof wasn’t closing from the tilt position, could this be looked at whilst in. An hour in I went to stretch my legs and noticed my car hadn’t moved. I was slightly concerned, but figured the service probably takes less than an hour so no issue. At three hours I advised a service rep that I had to leave no later than twenty minutes later to pick my children up from school and could not be late. I was advised my car was out of the workshop and in the valeting bay. Oh and did I know that my sunroof wouldn’t close so they couldn’t jet wash it. Apparently they had no idea I had asked the roof to be looked at. I again tried-iterated that I had to leave very shortly. At the time I had advised I had to leave still no car. I asked a lady on reception, explained again the urgency and that I need my keys without further delay. I was told they were just sorting my paperwork, despite the car having been supposedly out of the workshop for some time. Significantly late, I eventually got my keys back after threatening to make a huge scene in the dealership, that is how bad it got. The original lady from reception was busy gossiping in an office whilst the other lady on reception looked at me with indifference and told me they were dealing with it. Ultimately I got my keys thirty mi utes after I had first advised that time was pressing. To add insult to injury the car hadn’t even been vacuumed, so why it took so long from workshop to me is beyond me. Ultimately I was late picking my children up and they were rightly upset. The attitude of the staff was one of utter indifference, the service level was appalling and the complete lack of understanding beyond belief. I bought my car from Warrington, it’s always been serviced by Warrington, but hand on heart I will never set foot in that place again. Absolutely disgusted by the whole experience."
2021-07-06,4,"Everyone was friendly and polite, but the key drop off / COVID processes weren't quite in place. I had to physically hand my key over rather than drop it into a bag or drop box.
I had informed the dealership about my car needing separate authorisation to pay for the service (Toyota scheme) but this wasn't done in advance, only when I arrived, meaning that this time was potentially added to my wait. I don't know if it was or not - I knew I would have to wait, but wasn't told when the car was going on the ramp, only when it was in the middle of being valeted."
2021-07-05,1,"Mercedes has charged me for work on my car that was plainly due to faulty parts / poor construction of the vehicle. I complained at the time, asked for goodwill but was refused. I am told that the faults were ""wear and tear"" - this is both outrageous and ridiculous. Mercedes cannot simply declare that something is ""wear and tear"" in order to dodge responsibility for their own failings. On this definition of wear & tear literally every fault with a car would, regardless, be so categorised. For example, the boot struts on my 2016 GLC failed a year ago - the boot kept on closing. I was told that this was because the boot, as designed, was too heavy...but apparently I need to pay for new struts. Also, I have had to pay nearly £500 for a failed front camber arm ball joint. In fact, at service this year BOTH front joints had failed - one had been replaced only last year. The latter was replaced, this time, under warranty but I had to pay for the other. Why did these parts fail in the first place - the car is not driven harshly and has low mileage; in any event, why did the part fitted last year fail within 12 months? I have had further problems with the radio and the bonnet release catch. Oh...and 'Artico leather' isn't leather - its plastic. Simply putting an exotic word in front of the word leather doesn't convert it into leather."

I am grateful for the best car purchasing experience of recent times."

The first issue I had was reaching the garage before it closed as I was working till 6, but Paul reassured me he will wait until I arrive so I can collect my car on the same day, which was a massive relief. My car was taken care of by Peter who greeted me when I went to collect my car. He provided me with an in-depth breakdown of the work carried out and excellent customer service. The garage was unable to wash my car but I have been given a voucher to have a free full valet which I wasn’t expecting. I will highly recommend Inchcape Warrington."

2021-06-29,1,"I have chosen to change the title of my review - partly as there are some good people working for Inchcape I now realise it’s the commissioning between completely different companies under the BMW banner - that make it so as bad as it is.

Since my review below. BMW uk have emailed me direct. Each time staying the difference between them and the dealership. They e told me the chap from Inchcape will ring…then each time used those words ‘I understand your frustration’ when no ones bothered to ring from Inchcape. The consistency of service is a joke


When collecting my car from an MOT was given the price by a guy playing on his phone. Had to ask about what had come up during the inspection - one of which was an engine noise.

No knowledge of my warranty - was that someone didn’t ‘think’ some items would be covered - as I understand it there has been no
Diagnosis.

Brand New Tyres with only 20 miles on them
Classified as 23% worn.

No oil added to car, no advisory even though it was on as a warning. Found myself in the car park sorting it.

Dirty hand prints all over the bonnet (despite a clean)

I bought the car from BMW. Paid a premium and this is now the second time despite the gloss that the relationship between the franchise, BMW UK and Allianz (all branded under BMW GMbH) have left the me to navigate the service.

For the premiums you pay, there is no excuse"
2021-06-29,5,I was looking for a new BMW X2 and I can't praise the efforts of Chris Mayes of Inchcape highly enough. From the initial test drive arrangement to the sourcing of the new vehicle then I was very impressed. No pushy sales techniques just excellent customer service from start to finish.
2021-06-29,4,An issue of perception is that customers arriving early are kept waiting outside whilst staff busy themselves getting coffee. The perception is that employees' time is more valuable than customers'.
2021-06-29,1,"Mercedes Warrington

Booked 2 cars in for service 7 weeks ago turned up with 1st car then told no loan car, eventually given loan car. Upon arriving home phoned to be told that second car following day would not have loan car and could not collect. Rescheduled and confirmed for following week, today turned up and told not booked in, however if I leave it they will get it done.

She talked me through various options and did this without being pushy or going for a hard sell. She advised me which cars were in stock that met my needs and anticipated delivery times to the Reading branch. When I made my decision to buy a MINI, Marie was super helpful and thoughtful throughout the whole process."

2021-06-25,1,"Extremely Poor service Recieved from From Inchcape Toyota Burton by So called sales manager Himant. I will share my experience received from Himant the Sales manager. He was such a liar a pestering type of money monger who was interested to forcefully persuade the sales and almost harassing. I have placed a deposit for a Toyota Corolla automatic estate with one of the sales executive I told him I will get back following day after making final decision. But, that money monger guy Himant sales manager couldn't wait he was greedy for the sale and called me and pestering to go ahead with sales he was saying there is so many other people wants to buy that car which I have reserved with sales executive, so I should buy there and then so they don't loose sale. Also questioning what is my reason not to go ahead with sale that day and not allowing me to explain or think over. After receiving his peer pressure and his extraneous persuasive behaviour and pestering I asked him to refund by that time I couldn't handle his behaviour. I have decided to back off from the sales. I thought before purchasing that behaviour how extremely poor would be after sale. So I asked him I will not go ahead with the purchase refund my money back into the card. He was not keen on taking the card to refund I had ask him few times to refund finally he has taken my card details and confirmed the refund has been completed. But after 5 days when i have got in touch with him. He said he gave card details to business manager for the refund and he hasn't refunded the card payment. So I asked him to email me and update why this hasn't been done. I have waited 2 hours for response then I have called back. When i questioned and asked him why he hasn't responded he denied and lied to me that hasn't even spoken with me. Then his business manager confirmed he spoke to me on monday 21/06/21 they also refused refund and hanged up on my phone call several time. I had to called numerous times and reminded them they cannot withheld my money since I have cancelled the reservation I have also pointed out I will make a formal complaint to higher up management team if they don't refund also asked for their senior managers name they have finally refunded the money but refused to give the senior managers name and email address.

Furthermore I had to make other several phone calls no one answered final call has been transferred to the call centre. I had to explain the experience and and frustrated situation I was in. Also the extremely poor service I have received from Burton Toyota customer service agent Rebecca said stay on the line and she will update me with higher managers details for that branch I had to stay on phone for about 30 minutes after she got back and said they have refunded and further information can be given she asked them they haven't given that information. Then I have asked to give her managers name so I can file a complaint or get information about how to make a complaint also asked her what's the complaint procedure for their company. She has passed to her manager after speaking with Daniel Woods call centre in Preston few minutes with him he hanged up on me. Finally I searched google and found the General Manager name Dan Beresford and after sales manager name Carl Pearce. I have spoke to Carl briefly and explained what has happened he said he will inform the general manager. That's the experience I have received from inchcape Toyota in Burton. I will files this experience with the financial ombudsman and take it further action until they realise the extremely poor service they have provided. Their Address .

2021-06-25,1,"Unauthorised work carried out and was unsuccessful, the only positive is that this time I was not charged for the unauthorised work. I have brought my vehicle in for service work regularly over the last two years and on every occasion I have experienced poor work ranging from the use of incorrect oil to distorted wheel nuts caused by hugely over torquing the nuts. In every case I have had to either buy new parts to replace damaged ones or to bring the car neck to be “corrected” .

In all my life I have never experienced such consistently poor service work. You have a serious problem and need to sort it out."
2021-06-24,1,"Due to misleading information communicated (negligent and arguably misrepresentation of facts) by Inchcape I signed a lease contract that I certainly would not have - if the correct information had been communicated by them.
I signed a lease contract for a R-Line 1.5 Golf on the 19th of March 2021, through a broker and was told that delivery would be 12-14 weeks (in writing and as advertised) i.e. delivery mid to end of June 2021. Then later in April I was told by the broker that the build week was week 27 meaning that the car would not be in the UK until August 2021.
I then spoke to the supplying dealer (Inchcape Cheltenham) on the 29th of April 2021 and was told very forthrightly that the delivery was never, ever going to be 12-14 weeks and that Inchcape had ordered a large number of R-Line 1.5 Golfs to be built in week 27.
The broker then showed me what they called a “flyer” from Inchcape which clearly states delivery in 12 -14 weeks and yet to recap - Inchcape told me that delivery was never, ever going to be in 12-14 weeks, because the order with VW was never earlier than build week 27. This ‘flyer’ misled brokers and then, in term, unwitting consumers like me who end up taking out contracts. This week the build week moved to week 40 which I estimate means delivery beginning of November 2021 - a wait of almost 8 months for a pretty basic car.
If I had known the correct information and there had not been a misrepresentation of facts I wouldn’t have signed the lease contact and would not be left without a car to get to work for what will be many months.
In frustration I wrote to Inchcape’s CEO. Guess what? No reply nor even an acknowledgment of my letter."
2021-06-24,1,Chester dealership are garbage rude and lie also damaging your vehicle when in for repair then deny it was them don’t use go anywhere else also the customer relations manage only takes the side of the dealership with out looking into the facts
2021-06-24,5,Great experience of buying a new mini during lockdown. Good customer service. Good communication. Love the car!
2021-06-23,2,"Edit - Added conclusion at the bottom.....

(Applies to Inchcape Toyota, Derby).

Had the car 12 months now so I'm at the point where I've taken it in for a full service and MOT.....

Rear trailing arm bushes failed already (50k miles), luckily they're doing it under warranty else they'd want a grand or so! They didn't MOT it as it would have failed, so now I'm chasing them about to get the warranty work & MOT done, but it's like pulling teeth. They've ignored numerous emails, then claimed they can't get through to my phone, despite me getting everyone else's calls just fine, and then to top it off have reneged on their quoted prices (rear pads), despite me having an email stating the quoted price!

Various other issues that I won't go into, and surprise surprise, after an email to the service manager, they got in touch about 20 minutes after I hit 'send'! They have no booked my car in, although on the very day the MOT expires! Talk about cutting it fine.

My first experience with the after-sales process has left me wishing I hadn't parted with my TROUBLE FREE 2004 RAV4. I feel like I've been mugged.

I still love Toyota cars, I just wish the dealership lived up to the Toyota name

CONCLUSION - The service manager, Mick, stepped in to help and really went the extra mile to get my car sorted, so I'm finally sorted thanks to Mick. I still have a nasty taste in my mouth from the ordeal, but I'm happy that somebody stepped in and got things sorted in the end."

2021-06-23,4,"Car was booked in for MOT / End of warenty check. Nice to be greated by someone as i arrived who was expecting me. initial handover went smoothly, though there was one missing - i wasn't asked if there was anything else that needed looking at beyond the MOT / end of warrenty check it was booked in for.

When i was called later and informed i needed a new front tyre, they were willing to work with me on the price of a new tyre and bring the price closer to what i could get from BlackCircles. It could have been made clearer at the start of that conversation that the car would be needed for another day as parts had to be ordered - as it was, i was only informed at the end when i was told the car would be ready tomorrow. Minor point, but i did confuse me a bit as until that point in the conversation I was expecting to pick the car up that day

Pick up went smoothly - nice to be recognised again on arrival, and to offer to look after my bike inside the foyer whilst I completed handover."
2021-06-21,3,"Courtney was very helpful, and did a great job looking after the issues I had with my car.

It was strange you offer a price match on tyres but not to the price I found on F1 tyres and the cleaning of the car was awful compared to other garages, basic hoover and clean outside. There was still dust on the dash etc."
2021-06-21,5,Kidlington Toyota are excellent. Myself and my two daughters have all either bought vehicles or have them serviced at Kidlington because the service we get from the staff here is so good. I would recommend Kidlington over any other garage

2021-06-21,1,Just really poor service we had to keep phoning to see where you was up to with the van and sent emails with no reply so in the end we phone the people doing to work on it to see when they was picking it up they where great keeping us informed when the van was back with you then we had to phone you to arrange pick up you didn’t even phone us to say it was back when the service is due I will be going to another dealership to get it done I wouldn’t recommend you in my experience thanks
2021-06-21,1,Worst customer service ever. My car went in for MOT and when it returned it couldn’t even be driven. The garage wanted to charge me for the damage they caused. Shocking I would avoid at all costs. Definitely not what I expected from BMW
2021-06-21,3,"Booked car in for an MOT, and to assess knocking noise (suspected bushes). Dropped car off and as garage 45mins away and no courtesy car despite booking over a month in advance, so asked garage to let me know outcome, so I could instruct any extra work. Rang garage 4.30pm, told MOT ok, they found worn bushes & leaking washer fluid bottle so asked if they could be replaced but was told they couldn't and would have to re-book, then asked to come and pick car up as they shut at 5.30pm. Frustrating, and annoying to a point....seriously considering not having any other work done by Cooper BMW Ipswich, other than routine service. Been using them for years."
2021-06-21,1,"I booked my car in for the sat navigation to be updated, a couple of days after I noticed the navigation still wasn’t recognising some roads. I checked with Mercedes and they said there had been some confusion and they had update the command system instead. Then they tried to charge me a further amount to update the right software despite me having already paid for the update. Not my fault if they updated the wrong thing despite me confirming with the receptionist and 2 people in service as to what was being done and even writing on the envelope that the keys go in shat it was in for. I have told them I’m not prepared to pay any further money because of their mistake, they have been very unhelpful and I am still left out of pocket with an out of date sat nav. I am looking at going to the motor trade ombudsman very very disappointed with the whole experience at Warrington Mercedes!!"
2021-06-21,1,"Really poor overall experience.
Issues with online booking - booked a day that was not available so had to rebook and number plate reverted back to original plate rather than the private one lodged with DVLA.
Drop off ok.
No opportunity to pay before collection as promised on the booking which then led to a wait to collect my keys in a waiting room that did not appear to be COVID safe - no evidence of tables and surfaces being cleaned. When the lady eventually appeared with my keys and invoice (in the wrong name) she breezed through as if I had interrupted her day. I asked if I could just pay as I felt uncomfortable in the waiting area and she was visibly annoyed. I then had to use the card machine that she had been holding and the same with my car keys. This felt doubly uncomfortable as I had had to drop my keys into an envelope so your staff didn't have to touch them. The same review will be passed to MBUK."
2021-06-21,5,"My visit for my car's routine annual service was pleasant, the customer area safe-feeling and the work completed on time as promised - as usual."
2021-06-21,5,"I recently took my car in to have a niggling, irritating rattle in the driver door fixed - they have done it well done! I had taken it previously to Ascot Landrover but they failed to find or fix it!"
2021-06-21,5,"Jack Lewis, who was the advisor helping me, was very friendly, helpful and took into account everything that I said before showing me a car that was affordable for me, similar to what I was looking at (which was a bit more costly) and amazing. The service was quick, reliable and Jack was available even on his days off (via email) not only was Jack friendly, but Rob (I believe that was his name, he was doing my finance) was also very friendly, helpful and answered any questions I had.

Overall, I couldn’t of asked for a better service, it was exceptional."
2021-06-21,5,Great service. Very helpful staff. Cannot fault them.
2021-06-21,1,"I paid a £500 deposit to secure a vehicle with my credit card on the 25th of May, however the following day I was able to obtain a better deal and improved delivery date from another dealer. Called Inchcape Derby to explain and assured my deposit would be refunded within 7 to 10 working days. We’re now entering week 4 and have made over a dozen phone calls to get a resolution been passed from department to department and still no refund . Im glad I didn’t buy a vehicle from them their after sales service has been appalling"
2021-06-18,5,"We ordered our second Mercedes through Motability with the Help of Phil for Inchcape in Nottingham . He went above and beyond to get me the car I wanted, He sorted all the paperwork and all I had to do was esign a few forms and that was it. I received my car today and it is amazing. Even though Phil is away due to an operation he still has been in contact and has messaged me to keep me updated and to see if I am happy with the car. Phil has been there to answer all my questions and reassured me that it would be perfect when I received it, he sent me videos and links to help me to decide the model I wanted and he gave me his advice which was spot on and the result is one very happy customer . Inchcape you have a brilliant salesperson in Phil. Also many thanks to Mark for the handover as Phil is still recovering. Carnt wait to drive it now. Many Thanks"
2021-06-17,5,"First time I’ve used inchcape Chester and I would definitely recommend them
Vinny the sales man that helped me purchase my car was fantastic
From start to finish everything was made so simple and reassuring
Straight away I felt at ease and trusted him which was needed because I was buying a car unseen from a different inchcape showroom
Professional friendly and patient nothing was too much for him
He called the next day to make sure we drove home ok and everything was ok
Couldn’t ask for more"
2021-06-17,5,"Never have problems ,everything go smoothly.
That why use VW service so many years ..."
2021-06-16,5,"Very organised, staff helpful and friendly, very informative every step of the way, social distancing observed, very good experience"
2021-06-16,1,"Very DISAPPOINTED with their service. I had my Insignia's AC re-gassed with them but it was still the same, spoke with them again and told them AC is not working, I was told by their customer service that I need to book another appointment and I would need to pay the charges AGAIN!! VERY DISAPPOINTED."
2021-06-15,1,"Took my daughter's 2016 Polo to Inchcape Stockport for its full service and ""health check"" (for a fee of £350) asked them to check why the battery was going flat. Not included in the £350 but would look at it for £60 extra! (the ""health check"" is purely visual. No diagnostics used) If I wanted a battery supplied and fitted, that would be another £260, (the battery costs approx £120 so putting a battery in costs £140, apparently). Oh well, at least the car would be nice and clean due to the valet included in the £350. Well, it would've been but they didn't do it, despite having the car from 10.45am to 4.30 pm. So the car was dirtier than when I left it, complete with oily handprints. Car serviced, presumably. Customer service, dreadul."
2021-06-15,2,"The actual 'star' mark I wanted to leave was 2.5 but as the algorithm only allows whole stars we'll go with 2. I wouldn't necessarily say there was anything particularly 'bad' about the experience but it was altogether disappointing and wholly uninspiring. We had previously visited Guy Salmon in Portsmouth and if they had the car we wanted we would've put the business through them, even at a higher price. The service, atmosphere, attitude and overall experience we received was far superior.

Before we even got to seeing the car we were told it was available, then it wasn't, then it was and someone had left a deposit, then another sales person called and said it was available?!
Even after we had seen it and left £1000 we received another call asking if we were still interested in buying it?! There's a breakdown in communication there somewhere...

The issue we had with Inchcape Guildford was that we felt more of an inconvenience than as potential customers to a premium brand. Granted we weren't buying a top of the range, £100k+ car but this was an exciting time for us, stepping in to the luxury car market for the first time and felt we should've been treated the same as any customer, regardless of money. So rather than being special time it felt more like buying a sack of potatoes. I understand that Covid restrictions place a strain on all business but there are ways of mitigating this so that the customer experience is the best it can be. On our first visit to see the car it was brought out to us dirty with a coffee stained interior and lipstick marks. Just generally tatty for a car with sub 4k on the clock. After a quick 10 min viewing and no drive (as we felt we were taking too long) we were basically asked 'so, do you want it or not?'

We ultimately bought the car as it was in our budget and it was the spec we wanted but it wasn't an ounce to do with the sales tactics employed. Communication between us and your team was below average and in fact, the day we came to pick up the car, reception hadn't been passed our names, had no idea who we were or who our sales person was despite us arranging a time prior to arrival. We were sat down and told to wait while it was figured out and then we could get the keys. After a fairly awkward posed photo we were sent on our way. Altogether just a very lack lustre experience for a premium brand.

I can't see us using Inchcape again based on this experience unless they drastically improve. I have friends who buy from Audi and have told us how well they treat there customers.

As a side note we have also noticed what looks like covered up accident damage that wasn't disclosed but that is a separate letter.

Kind regards

Luke Dunbar"
2021-06-15,5,"Bought an approved used BMW from Inchcape in December last year. Unfortunately the vehicle developed a fault with the brakes which required repair/replacement of parts etc.
My car was collected and a hire vehicle supplied.
Although the repair took a few weeks (due to national shortage of parts) I was kept fully updated.
My car has now been returned and is as good as new - it has a complete new set of discs and pads.
Overall an excellent service and would definitely recommend BMW at Colchester.
Also a big thank you to Paul Bryant who coordinated everything and kept me updated…"

2021-06-14,5,Amazing service and so helpful they run about all day to sort my new car out so I could drive home that night I put them under pressure to get it sorted the same day and Liam and Rebecca were so amazing and got it ready to save me driving back because I live 3 hours away from the garage I highly recommend them AMAZING AND SO HELPFUL IN EVERY WAY THANKS AGAIN
2021-06-10,5,"Diagnostics and repairs to seals to injectors. The service was fantastic and the car was washed afterwards - it looked brand new.
Mercedes of Leicester has some really excellent mechanics and engineers. I would single out Harish, on this visit, for his professionalism, courtesy and efficiency. Thank you."
2021-06-10,5,Fantastic service and a very helpful and knowledgeable sales person who guided me through all the documentation. Thank you!!
2021-06-08,1,"The first car I bought from them was a fairly uneventful affair, as it should be. The second one was, and continues to be, a shoddy affair.

Car ordered. Wrong car delivered. 'Right' car sourced and delivered, then on closer inspection turns out to have some variations from the specification they gave at purchase. Ombudsman complaint still ongoing over this due to the sales staff and dealership taking zero responsibility for the discrepancy.

Then a technical issue with the car, which appears to have afflicted a decent number of other VW owners. First attempt at a fix clears the problem for a little while and then it reoccurs with a vengeance. In for a second time, no progress due to parts on backorder. Communications poor with me having to chase them and not getting a call back regarding (lack of) progress and collection until an hour before they close despite it seeming that the car has been out of the workshop since about midday.

Difficult to see any reason why i'd choose either this dealer franchise or the manufacturer for future purchases.

EDIT 30/6/21 - They also seem to find it reasonable to announce half way through the day that your car is in for work that they want to close the dealership an hour early so they can go and watch the football. All with no consideration of whether you've already planned around them operating to their normal working hours to pick up your car."
2021-06-08,5,"We recently took delivery of 2 cars for domestic use; one VW Polo Match edition and one brand new T Roc. We are delighted with the service that we both received from Jonathan Clapham. The entire process was trouble free from start to finish with Jonathan taking us through all of the documentation with clear explanation. Furthermore, we highly recommend this car dealership since every target date was met and a professional service given, well done.

2021-06-08,1,"POOR SERVICE AND ATTITUDE - I wanted to pick-up my new Golf due to Covid and Hygiene reasons. I hired a one-way hire car; very expensive at the moment; and made the 360 mile, 10 hour round trip. This was a considerable saving for Inchcape VW Cheltenham in terms of a delivery driver and in return I asked for a full tank of fuel and a VW merchandise voucher; no value mentioned. After various emails Inchcape offered the full tank of fuel and nothing else; this is part of the fuel they would have used to deliver the car anyway. So they saved and I spent on a hire car fuel and my time. Not satisfied!"
2021-06-08,1,"1st of all the dealer kept the car for whole day and when I picked up the car, it was given with some power cables with black stains on car seats.
The car wasnt cleaned nicely from inside and water spots were still inside on the door.
Very poor service after paying £400 plus for servicing from here. I would never recommend again."
2021-06-08,1,"After Two years of fighting - it is looking likely i will need to take this down the legal route.

New car ordered in 2019, within 7 days the infotainment system started playing up, After some research it was linked to the connected drive system which is to my new knowledge a long standing issue with BMW and Mini vehicles.

Retailer lied saying i needed factory fit options, after 18 month fight BMW UK admitted it was defective and withdrew the system.

During a subject access request, I discovered the sales executive forged my signature on a number of documents (spelling my surname wrong was one give away)

The head of business and legal department even denied it and accused me of forgetting i signed it.

Extract form motor ombudsman report ""Inchcape has said that they accept the signatures were not Mr Shield’s, but there is no proof that they were
done by a member of staff. I am still of the view that if we consider who may have had access to the
documents, it is more likely that it was someone at the business,""

Thankfully for others Inchcape have sold on their BMW branches so others may not get stung by these behaviours, but when it appears that head office and legal teams support their ""head of business"" employees. It seems they think its OK to Lie and Forge customers signatures on documents."
2021-06-06,1,"God awful experience. Don’t pay the premium for this dodgy secondhand car dealer.

Turned up to collect an approved mini and there were scratches all over it, sticky spills in the inside, dirt on the seats and paw prints in the boot. Complained and the salesman agreed it was unacceptable, called his boss, and came back to me to say I could take it or leave it. I needed a car so had to take it.

Complained through mini group, finally had it collected to be fixed. Exterior sorted but interior not touched. Took a little cash to sort it myself as this place is a joke!

Save your money and go to a decent family run place that operates with integrity and pride."

2021-06-01,3,"The customer service was fine, dropped off and picked up my car fine but then they wiped off all my personal settings that was on my car prior to giving it to them such as phone book, Bluetooth calls system and time etc without preventing me, found that annoying"
2021-06-01,1,"This review is for the Cooper MINI branch in Chelmsford, Essex.

They removed my MINI's undertray, didn't reattach it and are now saying it was never there in the first place. Told me a series of contradictory lies and the problem is still outstanding. I have had to escalate my complaint to senior management. I have been a customer since 2013, never taken my MINI anywhere else for servicing, and have spent in excess of £1,500 on the past two visits, this experience has completely tarnished my opinion of this company.

EDIT: After complaining to Head Office, they admitted liability and have now fitted a new undertray free of charge. However, due to the dishonest way in which they treated me initially, I shall not be returning to this dealership and was going to be buying a new car soon but will now look elsewhere.

For all future customers, I recommend taking photos of your car before it goes in for service and checking it after."

Happy to provide more detailed calls and email details,"
2021-05-28,5,Good afternoon. I was looking for a Golf R with a very specific specification. Jules dealt with me from the start and was excellent throughout. He was reliable and honest. I told him of a bad experience I'd had prior with another non VW dealership and just asked for honesty due to my high standard of vehicle I was looking for. This was met and in a personal video Jules identified little bits of work which were sorted prior to my arrival with no hassle what so ever. I travelled over 100 miles to view the car and it was exaclty as described which immediately put me at ease. The transaction was smooth and Jules did everything to make that a pleasant and easy experience. I just want to thank him again for his honesty and professionalism and in the future I wouldn't hesitate to purchase a vehicle from there again.
2021-05-28,5,"Mercedes Nottingham / Parts & Service

The service provided by this department is sublime.

Quick & Effective / Polite & Well Mannered.

Tony Cooper, your a credit to yourself and a valuable asset to this organisation.

Quote By Mr Cooper

“ It needs to be right because I’ve got a duty of care to my customers”

This is very reassuring as the vehicle is my Sons car ( Purchased new from Northampton Mercedes)

If the sales team provided this level of service, I would be driving the AMG G-Wagon.

Clearly this dealership is more than capable of delivering excellent customer service.

Maybe the DP needs to take a look at the front of house & retail.

My Advice

Buy elsewhere and have your vehicle maintained by Nottingham."
2021-05-28,2,"My car had a recall from Mercedes. It was scheduled as a 30 minute job. In and out. I could not believe it when I turned up, waited an hour, only to be tile that the dealership did not have the part in stock. Unbelievable!!! I was then told that my car was deemed unsafe to drive, they would not give me a courtesy car as I did not have my licence with me, so I was somewhat stranded in the middle of nowhere. I had to sign a disclaimer to drive home in my own car. The part took over a week to arrive and it was another hour spent at the dealership to fit it. I have complained to customer services at Mercedes about this (and other issues since buying the car) and they seem to want to just brush it all under the carpet. A quick sorry and goodbye."

2021-05-25,5,"Exceptional service given to me in a no car crisis following an accident. My initial contact was left as an answerphone message on their sales number. Very quickly a dedicated sales team member contacted me to arrange a salesroom meeting (unavoidably so as there were various documentary proofs required and contractural papers to be endorsed for a Motability Scheme vehicle). I was kept in touch through the whole process, from order, adaptation, to delivery of my sparkling new Motability Scheme leasehire car. Inchcape Toyota lacked for nothing in their total commitment to getting me mobile again and the entire team at Edison Road Basingstoke have my admiration and thanks for such a fast, professional reinstatement of a brand new adapted Motability lease hire vehicle. External communication was tip top at all times and in house staff kind and professional. I have always felt in the best hands and Inchcape Toyota were my go-to supplier in this time of unforeseen need of a replacement car. Wonderful service from a fully integrated team with very exacting standards."
2021-05-24,2,"2nd time the vehicle has been taken into dealership for a brakes fault. First visit no effort to repair. Second visit has resulted in brakes being worse than before.

Called branch to speak with senior manager, no one on site, ended up speaking with Business manager, who told me I should call the service booking line again. This is a 6 month old £100k car with brakes that grind like Metal on metal.

As a new customer to Mercedes after 25 years with Land Rover, The service from Mercedes is somewhat disappointing."
2021-05-24,2,"At both VW dealers (Manchester and Bury) I visited, I was continually pressured. Before I even got to the Manchester dealership, the sales manager Wayne phoned me to say I should sign the order form AND pay the sale price BEFORE arriving! Apparently, it was to save time as the system took so long. Yeah, right. At Bury the salesperson was continually asking me to take the finance option with the excuse ""I'm only trying to save you money"". When I test-drove the electric Golf at Manchester, there was a loud thump at the rear of the car when I braked quickly. Waynes response was ""Thats normal"" and that when I walked away. Beware, Golf Electrics make that thump when the under-strength shockers are worn out from carrying the outsize battery. My advice is stay clear of these dodgy dealers, steer clear of the e-Golf and buy a Nissan Leaf like I did. Very nice car."
2021-05-24,5,"The whole experience with Inchcape was really easy. Phil was really helpful in showing me the car and how it works. Then found me the exact car I wanted and ordered it for me. It came within a few weeks. Phil kept me updated the whole way through, sent me videos, got all the details for the insuranceover to me. It was really exciting. The whole process was really easy. I am very happy with my new car. Thank you."

2021-05-20,2,"The first visit was great, test drove a car we liked.. found the model in Swindon which had to be drove up, this took 6 days for the car to be ready which was slower than expected. Updates were slow and I was constantly chasing with emails and calls.

On agreement we signed for the car and was promised a 3 year service plan and a full tank of petrol... to drive the car away and the fuel light come on.
To then also receive a letter for a 2 year service plan is a kick in the teeth. I will be ringing up customer services to complain about this and pick this up.
Also then be told on the day we collected the car that the sales guy was leaving at the end of the week ... which connects all the dots as to why the service wasn’t great. Nice guy but poor customer service all in all."

Andrew Brooke was made available, he understood my circumstances and very quickly made a number of options available to me. Andrew had extensive knowledge of both Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and guided me in the right direction when making my decision, and was never pushy. Exceptions were made on a deal I had sourced online, to match that vehicle and deal and then again to source one for me within 10 working days of my enquiry. Jaguar Land Rover York kept me informed every step of the way while waiting for my vehicle and facilitated a brilliant handover with a different member of their sales team, Malcolm."

2021-05-14,1,"Appalling. Having lost a wiper blade midweek (flew off on the motorway; I had previously asked for the blade to be checked at a previous service booking for a non-relating issue, as I suspected that there was an issue with it. I was assured it had been checked and there was no issue. Obviously this was not the case or it wouldn’t have flown off, who has ever had that happen to them?), I rang the service dept on Friday morning, advised them of the issue and requested that as it was an emergency could they see me Saturday morning. I confirmed that the wiper arm was in damaged and that it was simply a new blade that was required. They took my details and confirmed they would be able to fit a new blade. Upon arrival Saturday morning I checked in and then the service representative came to discuss what my issue was. She then departed to action the work. Less than 10 minutes later she returned and advised me that unfortunately they didn’t have the required part in stock, that it would have to be ordered and it would take 3 days.
Given that I had rung up the day before and had my details taken, I queried how this could be and why was it that I had been told to bring my car in. The response was non-apologetic, no concern for my inconvenience , or for the fact that it was now raining and how was I supposed to get home - I was simply told ‘ well it wasn’t me you spoke to’. When I then requested that, given the situation, could a blade be taken off one of the cars for sale at the dealership, so that I could get back on the road, the response was disdainful and arrogant. She was ‘not prepared to authorise that’. When I asked why the response was ‘because that’s not how it works’ and that I’d have to wait till the part arrived. When I responded with the fact that it was now raining and how was I supposed to get home the response was a shrug and I was told that ‘Mercedes Benz does not recommend driving in the rain with defective wipers’. I was then told that I could request further assistance from Mercedes Benz SOS service ‘press the red button in your car’. Subsequently this was what I had to do and a hire car was arranged, with my car being recovered to MB Warrington.
When I was able to collect my car I asked to see the Service Manager, as
1. The blade had obviously not been checked as requested
2. Why was it confirmed with me to bring my car in on the Saturday to have a blade fitted, when they didn’t have one in stock
3. Why was my request to have a blade fitted from a sales stock vehicle point blank refused, given its a clip on/clip off consumable which would have put me back on the road immediately.
It would be fair to say that the service manager listened, but did not hear and did not address any of the 4 points above, instead he had his own narrative which he kept reiterating. However he did ask was I rude to the service colleague, which I confirmed I was, upon which I was told that that wasn’t acceptable on my part. He was not at all interested when I advised that my rudeness to her was in direct response to her bad attitude, arrogance and complete disinterest in myself as a customer, and that the situation deteriorated on both sides.
Finally, when he advised me of the work that had been done, he made reference to the cost which he confirmed had been advised to me prior to the work being done. This actually never happened, the first I knew of the cost was when he was giving me back my keys.
I would also add that there were two other customers in the service waiting area at the same time as myself. One customer was also complaining about the poor communication and customer service he was receiving ( he had been told his car would be ready earlier that day and upon arrival it wasn’t, and no-one had called him to tell him. The other customer heard my conversation with the service manager and confirmed that he’d also been dealt with rudely by a member of the service team, and pointed her out to me. Hardly surprising that it was the same colleague who’d dealt with me.
I shan’t be using MB Warrington for the servicing of my car in the future."

2021-05-10,5,"I just got a car from this dealer (in Sandhurst) and I am so happy! I was dealing with Jade, she was absolutely amazing, she handled everything quickly and made the whole process easy like a Sunday morning! She went through all options I had, was very clear on what I should expect next etc., explained the steps on the first meeting and upon collection, Jade was just a pleasure to deal with. I highly recommend the salon and Jade!"
2021-05-10,5,"Jaguar Land Rover, as a company have an inherent Achilles heel, which is the dealer network and needs such an overhaul on customer service and interaction, as customers are simply walking away when the receive poor service, and it is all too common. I have experienced the good and bad across JLR dealers and franchises many times and with being a member of the JLR Customer Advisory Board, I see many, too many, negative comments about the inconsistency between dealers of the JLR product.

What could JLR do to correct this is to invest more on genuine brand enthusiasts (such as myself) who know whats expected of a dealer and how the customer should be cared for and gain feedback from this and not the flawed 'mystery shopper' system.

Better still they could take a lesson from Chester Land Rover, who really have raised the bar in customer service and engagement. Without doubt after many years of being a customer of the brand across many dealers, THIS dealer has completely nailed it and then cemented it in place!!! Above and Beyond doesn't do them justice, from initial inquiry, to delivery to the follow up phone calls, the service provided has been ultra SVO perfect!!"
2021-05-10,5,Problem quickly and efficiently sorted. Thank you.
2021-05-10,1,"Absolutely shocking experience from Inchcape Toyota Basingstoke.

They took my car on an unnecessary test drive (I was only having tyres replaced) where they drove 27mph over the speed limit and with 13 ""Hard Accelerations"" 7 ""Hard brakes"" according to the Toyota app.

When I raise this issue they first denied that the car had been driven at all, then when I shows the proof they told me that was standard practice to test drive after tyre changes.

To top it all off, when I took the car home, I realised they fitted the wrong tyres anyway and I had to take to another garage to buy new tyres again a few days later.
I have been chasing for weeks to get a refund, the service manager is never available to take my calls and had not replied to my email in over a week.

AVOID ANY DEALING WITH INCHCAPE TOYOTA AT ALL COSTS"
2021-05-09,5,friendly and very helpful
2021-05-09,1,"**ATTENTION** Stay well clear ! Never again. They got caught out lying (black and white evidence) and now refusing to even service a brand new car I bought from them. Inchcape said they would fix prior to their lies being found out. Stay well clear of Inchcape Group. Disgusting service and now politely telling me where to go ! After how many thousands they taken off me. Bmw should be ashamed. Inchcape have now removed my ability to comment on their Facebook page, clearly not wanting anyone seeing this"
2021-05-08,1,"Update 17th May
Reservation Fee refunded.
Still no reason what car sold even after I reserved it.


I would not trust the Inchape Jaguar York branch.
Firstly, I have email evidence that I had paid my reservation fee for a car. Next morning after 3 hours of opening, a salesman rang to say the car had been sold. He did not respond o my call of a explanation. This is wrong.
Secondly, They still have not returned the deposit. Again this is wrong."
2021-05-06,1,"No v5 available for the car despite being told it was.
Visits to 2 post offices to obtain v62
Then tax can only be taken for 6 months.
Extra costs v62 £25 tax £25 only recompense was to fill tank. Garage had the cheek to require £500 deposit as my v5 for trade in was with dvla due to number plate swap.
Total hand over time 3.5 hours. Total shambles
Compared with the purchase of my previous Jaguar from Rybrook. Would NOT recommend Incape to anyone."
2021-05-06,5,"Excellent service. Car was ready to be collected and stored inside the showroom to allow me to inspect on arrival with promise of heavy rain showers. Car was presented in immaculate condition and Jules from car sales and the manager Mike was very helpful and courteous at all times. Any concerns or questions I have asked since purchase have been handled and addresses professionally.
The dealer goes that step further to ensure your purchase experience is pleasurable and hassle free. I will definitely be looking to purchase my next vehicle through this dealer. Very highly recommended"

2021-05-04,5,"I enquired about a vehicle on a Wed morning, by that afternoon I had had a call and email from Jack and a personalised video of the vehicle in question.

A smooth transaction and everything that was said would be done was, highly recommend both Jack L and the dealership; outstanding customer service"

I was dealing with Colin Sutton, he was very helpful and explained everything very well. I was very happy with the service from him and the speed of the purchase was excellent. I picked up the car after a 3 hour drive and the car was exactly the way it was shown on the pictures. Colin made sure everything was in good order and was very efficient. Thank you so much!"

2021-04-30,5,This is a review of Inchcape Jaguar Norwich. I cannot recommend them highly enough especially the sales man Richard Turner. Was extremely helpful from the very beginning of the process helping us buy our I Pace. He went out of his way to answer my many questions as I'm new to owning an ev. The best experience I've ever had buying from a dealership and would highly recommend if you are looking for a new or used car
2021-04-30,5,"Repairs carried out promptly, excellent courtesy car.
The work was carried out using the Land Rover extended warranty which I have found to be first class, I
personally would only buy a used Land Rover from a dealer that could provide that warranty."
2021-04-29,5,I purchased my vehicle from Mercedes Nottingham from Phil he is an excellent salesman and very knowledgeable. The car was immaculate and everything I wanted. I will definitely buy again from Phil as he cares so much about his customers and is a true gem in the motor industry.
2021-04-29,1,"Worst experience in 35 years of buying cars - bought online, car had incorrect wing mirror, broken demister, knocking and scraping noises due to anti-rollbar/CV joint issues, damaged trim, damaged seat belts, faulty rear camera, creaking suspension and even mud and dog hairs inside... worse than buying from a dodgy dealer yet sales person had assured me how immaculate the car was of course! To cap it all Inchcape Norwich refused to accept my statutory right to return (!) and charged me hundreds of pounds to collect the car. Head of Dealership completely ignored my emails too. Would never recommend to *anyone* - 0/5 for car, 0/5 for service!"
2021-04-28,5,Excellent customer service !

2021-04-26,5,"Recently purchased a Mercedes A Class A200 Exclusive Edition and was very happy with the service received.

Made purchasing the new car very efficient."
2021-04-25,1,Bought a used Q2 15 moths ago from Cheshire Oaks just before lockdown started. Driving along the motor way the car became unstable. Thought we had a flat tyre but all looked okay. We drove home cautiously and took it to a tyre place for checking assuming a balancing weight has been lost. It turned out the tyre had had a flat and the foam had been used. The foam had come loose from the wall and was bouncing around inside the tyre. There was wall damage on the tyre and should never have been left on the car as it had the potential to blow out. We have sent two emails to Inchcape but they have not even bothered to respond. We expected more
2021-04-24,5,"Recently bought a Mercedes E Class from Mercedes Derby. Reserved online and then spoke to a salesman called Christopher. Brilliant, one of the best salesman I have done business with, car purchased via online, car was delivered but found a few problems with the car, Christopher sorted everything out, from collecting, sorting the issues out and then returning the car. Fantastic job, would recommend this dealership and Christopher."
2021-04-24,4,I broke down on a Friday early evening and had chance to call before 6pm to ask if I could have my car dropped off at the dealership. Now I know that it is possible to have my car left next door at Land Rover as the carparking spacers in front of the show room door are not gated. I have had my Jaguar left there once before but the reply I had back was no as all entrances would be locked. On having my car dropped off on the Monday I doubled checked the Land Rover entrance as as like last time no gates. I made the point of mentioning this when I picked up my car after repair. I have also had issues getting to talk to someone from the Jaguar service department. Now the issue seems to be your telephone system and this centralisation as to book my repair I was talking to someone in Preston and on the couple of times me thinking I could go via another department I find myself talking to another person in another part of the United Kingdom. So please can you put a phone on the service desk so you can talk to those who can tell you want is happening. When I did pick up my car I got full story with regards to my repair and issues had and what to be careful about from those working on the desks which was more than expected. When it was H A Fox when I called I went straight to one of the service desks or I was politely told they were busy and to call back or can they call me but as of this episode I would be hanging on listening to music and going from one connection to another. Nothing wrong with the work carried out on my Jaguar.
2021-04-24,5,"Recently purchased an F Type Jag and was very impressed with the sales experience. Scott was helpful, friendly and maintained excellent communication throughout the process. From organising a test drive to sorting any minor issues, he went the extra mile to ensure that the experience was stress free. A credit to the company."
2021-04-23,5,"Cobham Mini. Buying a new Mini. A really pleasant experience. I mean very pleasant. Great service, excellent good manners, good knowledge and an ability to anticipate, rather than thinking of ways to say ""no"" which is my experience of most UK service providers. Indeed the service provided was superb. Not to be confused with those in BMW Financial Services which is a very different experience."
2021-04-22,1,"Went to Southport mercedes dealership for a recall on my mercedes 220d.
They couldn't get the program update to complete and asked that I return a week later, which I did.
A free health check was offered and this came back pointing out that the brake discs front and rear were scratched and the rear drums were corroded, nothing else was mentioned in that report other than the £650 cost.
The car had just been serviced by a different garage and no such problems were raised by them
However, back to Inchcape Southport branch....
When the update had been done the following week, and I was told it was all ok to go, I drove less than a mile and noticed three warning lights on the dashboard plus a warning on the dashboard screen alerting me that the ABS, the traction control and the run flat tyre warning were not working.
I returned to the dealership to be told this was nothing to do with anything they had done.
They came out with a report from the week before stating that a sensor on the drive shaft was faulty. They said this was causing the faults along with affecting the speedometer readings too. No mention of this had been made at any point to me.
The latest report showed this fault along with one on the passenger side seat belt buckle, again nothing had been said to me or my wife, and bearing in mind that this fault disables the airbags on the passenger front side, I asked if perhaps they had heard of health and safety.
Obviously not, as they were content to allow a customer and his wife to drive away with none of these systems working.
Having challenged them that the reason the warning lights might be something to do with the update or resets they had performed, both the technician and manager were adamant that these were mechanical faults and nothing to do with what they had done
A ""free"" safety recall update has now cost me slightly more than £360, which apparently I should be grateful to pay as it included a discount of £18.
Yes I was given a courtesy car for the time the work was done, with the welcoming comment of ""I bet you don't want to give us that back"" on my return.
I'd like to think I could get a proper reaction to my complaint and ill feeling about my treatment and experience......."
2021-04-21,5,"I had my xf in for an inspection for a fault, they kept me up to date all throughout the day on the progress.

2021-04-21,2,"Gave this company glowing review after purchasing new F Pace. All seemed well till the first time I needed to cool the car with the air conditioning. On a 120 mile journey suffered internal cabin temperature well into the 20s as the air con would not cool. Because I could not get to H A Fox who are not local, booked car into my local dealership who diagnosed an almost empty air con that needed gassing and leak check. Disappointed that the so called PDI didn’t pick this up or wasn’t carried out. Let H A Fox know who said that would check with their service dept, and asked me to let them know how I got on. Just think that H A Fox should have called me, and also should have rung after I purchased the car to see if all was ok and I was happy with the car. Following that had issue with boot latch that did not lock. Spoke direct to Jaguar to get that resolved"
2021-04-20,5,"I bought my third Mercedes car but first time from Inchcape.

2021-04-17,5,"We have recently bought a new Mercedes from Inchcape Nottingham. Phil Litchfield, our sales advisor, provided excellent, attentive service. Initially communication was by email and phone calls, as the country was in lockdown, but Phil answered all our questions fully, giving reasoned advice, making positive suggestions and recommending alternatives. Collection of the car was after lockdown had ended; there was a smooth handover that was friendly and informative. Phil followed up with post-purchase phone calls to ensure the car was satisfactory and there were no concerns. The whole process has been seamless, and we have no hesitation in recommending Phil for his level of customer care and exemplary service."

2021-04-15,1,"Dear Chris Padget,

I have raised a formal complaint against you directly and the conduct of Mercedes Benz, Nottingham.

I am appalled on how you dealt with me as a Mercedes Customer. Under no circumstances should any business speak to customers the way you spoke to me. You spoke over me, interrupted me, laughed at my comments, gave no positive advice and accused me of being awkward. You also never apologised for the frustration I have experienced with your team and how the issue has been handled – instead you chose to patronise and antagonise. You offered no help whatsoever. All you have done is make the issue 10 times worse than it was.

You may feel that as an employee of a worldwide business such as Mercedes this behaviour is acceptable – however it is not, under any circumstances and I won’t tolerate it, accept it OR move on from it. This is the 1st complaint persue. I have already raised an official complaint directly regarding your business conduct and the customer service received, by you at Mercedes Benz today [15th April 2021]. Despite me living and working in Nottingham, your attitude towards me has concluded I now go to the next nearest Branch –Derby – which I am sure doesn’t concern you – however if I had feedback like this in my profession I would not be pleased – especially if it was me as a Director [as I am] making customers feel like this. I may be 1 customer out of tens of thousands, but I am going to ensure a full complaint and investigation is carried out on your conduct.

I have involved Customer Services. I request an official apology from you for how you choose to conduct your services with me. I also have requested Mercedes Customer Services to open a full investigation on the conduct and handling of my case [start to finish]. Failing satisfactory outcome I will pursue a claim and complaint via The Motor Ombudsman Codes of Practice.

Regards


Craig Pearce"
2021-04-15,1,"Mercedes Inchcape DERBY is probably the most USELESS car dealership ever. Waited a week to test drive a car, get a call the day before saying we can't get hold of the car. Incredibly poor customer service and I'll be going to BMW instead purely for this reason"

2021-04-13,5,"Swift attentive service, kept me in the loop at all times; very professional"
2021-04-12,1,"This is by far the worst garage i have ever been too. My car has been to them so many times to get fixed and many times come out in a worse state than when it went in. Most recently after being told NOT to wash my vehicle because last time after being Told NOT to was it, they did.. ruined it and it cost them thousands to get it fixed.
So now the car is coved in scratches once again but now they are claiming i never told them not to wash it, when i did and on 20+ Other visits to them they have never washed it.
This was supposed to be my dream car and it has been ruined, fixed (as best possible, not perfect like it was). It was because they admitted liability. Now ruined again, which leaves me as a customer now not wanting my dream car anymore and never wanting to own a Mercedes ever again because of the incompetence and lack of customer care from the Cheshire oaks branch of your business."

2021-04-06,1,Vehicle was booked in for investigation of a suspected oil leak. I was subsequently sent a health check video showing underneath the vehicle & the location of the suspected leak. I was then contacted by Isabella Miotti (who was actually fantastic & deserves a 5 star review) who informed me that the cost to remove the gear box for further investigation would be £756 & that I would be liable to pay this if the fault was not covered under my 2yr used car warranty. As I had only purchased the vehicle 6wks ago she had took the initiative to contact Llandudno VW to see if they would be willing to cover the cost which they were not. I subsequently contacted Llandudno who agreed to repair the vehicle at no cost to myself. I was therefore required to pay the £60 initial diagnosis fee to VW Chester. I then collected my vehicle. Thankfully I made it home safely. The following morning when I went to drive the vehicle the clutch pedal had no resistance & stayed down. My partner looked under the bonnet & discovered the hydraulic fluid which is used for the clutch & the brakes was below minimum. I received a health check sheet from Chester informing me that brake fluid had been checked & a tick confirming no issues. Clearly this was not checked at the time of diagnosis as had it been the technician would have realised that it was a hydraulic leak & not an oil leak. I am also reliably informed that hydraulic fluid has a completely different smell to engine oil. I struggle to see how this was not detected at the time by VW Technicians.
2021-04-05,5,"No issues, brought in for a safety recall and minor service."
2021-04-05,1,I was booked to collect the vehicle and had the appointment cancelled within an hour of the appointment time which caused a massive inconvenience as the next appointment wasn't available for almost a week after

2021-04-01,1,"Satnav in car not working, update on maps not solved the problem, called into Land Rover inchcape Chester, met the most rudest man on the planet, who was no help and advised me to call to book in and walked off.
Called Chester store explained problem and advised me it needed to go on diagnostics to find fault. Queried if it would show up on diagnostics as that is for engine faults. Advised yes ours is specialist and will find fault.
Took car in on arranged day, took forever to call me back to advise they would need a further 3 hours investigation time because they think it could be the gps but not sure. So, the diagnostics have not given you a precise fault, which I queried beforehand.
No, it shows there may be a wiring fault and to know that we need to do further checks, how much is this costing, I ask.
Well, it’s £96 for the diagnostic test ( which didn’t tell you anything) and a further £504 to do the extra work.
Hang on, so you’re going to charge me £504 on top of the £96 and then it might not be the fault, because your not sure? And then if it is the fault I have to pay more again?
Now, I’m soft but I’m not that soft!
I’m also angry that I had to pay £96 which was not conclusive, not only that, I have never in my life paid a garage to find a fault, they have always looked at my car and found the fault then given me a price to sort it.
Needless to say i collected my car, again from mr grumpy, and I won’t be back!


From the reply I’ve received on my review, it clearly shows inchcape Chester do not value your custom.
Buyer beware!"
2021-03-31,5,"Good to deal with and i am happy with my new F-Pace.
I will say that my experience improved when Tea Simpson took over as my sales person, She was always willing to answer any query no matter how small. So overall very happy considering in the middle of lockdown."

2021-03-30,1,"Inchcape Chester, disgraced by their behaviour and lies, they are underhand and as for their customer care, well she is unbelievably rude!!! My Range Rover vogue went back 10 times within 4 months, they didn’t except my reject of the car and this was sold as a manufacture approved vehicle!!! What joke of a place, they do not have the ability to deal with dissatisfied customers, dishonest retailers like this need to be named and shamed, that’s exactly what I intend."
2021-03-30,5,"Mostly a remote experience, initially arranging a vehicle service and subsequently buying a new car. I was clear what I wanted in terms of model, spec and price and Ollie was quick to find a car that matched our expectations (with a bit of give and take on both sides). Slight delay in getting the car into the dealership and ready for delivery (the challenges of the BMW system!). Finally delivered to our home this morning and it lives up to all our expectations."
2021-03-30,5,An excellent service provided by Phil Litchfield who was very patient with me given I kept changing which car I wanted and was always available to answer the many questions I had. Phil put a lot of effort in given all the communication had to be done via email and phone as opposed to in person even recording videos of the cars for me. It was due to this excellent customer service that I decided to buy from this dealership instead of a local one.

2021-03-28,5,"My purchase of a new vehicle from Mercedes Nottingham was all done with ease electronically & collection was dealt with full covid guidance, yet still able to make it feel like a personal experience to the point of driving away in my new a250e"
2021-03-27,1,"Spoke with Shaz yesterday to extent and agreed details for the purchase of the car today.
What a nice Man. A pleasure to deal with.
Shaz was on his day off today so he was to leave all the visit care to Cam
Turned up 09.40 and was more than let down by the Staff on Site!!!! No one manning the desk and upon attendance, no greeting or civil exchange took place from Staff.
I was made to feel like I had interrupted their morning and it was clear as day that they weren't interested in making a sale at all!!!
A truly dreadful attitude towards the customer.
They should be so sorry Shaz.
Yet another client with a pocket full of money has turned on his heels and bought elsewhere."
2021-03-26,5,Lee (Dwayne) handled my new car handover exceptionally well considering the challenges of COVID restrictions.
2021-03-26,5,brilliant service from start to finish especially from the staff on my purchase of my used Discovery 5. Vehicle preparation and hand over was excellent cannot be faulted.
2021-03-26,5,"I popped my car into vw exeter recently because an inspection now light came on. I spoke with the service department and they advised me that if i could get to them before lunch time they would help me. I arrived before 1pm, and Matt came and started working on my car to find the computer glitch, he spent probably 25 mins of his lunch time, graciously working through the faults to reset my car. I was so grateful to him for doing for me, not complaining at all. He could have said come back another time because this is taking to long, but he just got on with it and helped me. Matt deserves a bottle of wine or some beers as a thank you !!

Inchcape have always helped me and this is why i continue to be a customer of theirs in Exeter.

Thanks again !!"

2021-03-23,5,"It's been quite a few years since we purchased a new car and the first time to purchase an Audi. We stayed local due the current climate and and we couldn't have received better service. Ian Earle at Cheshire Oaks Audi kept us fully informed, from the moment the chosen vehicle was found on the system to the collection of the vehicle, a period of time later. He was polite, friendly and professional at all times We are extremely happy with entire experience and of course our new vehicle."

2021-03-17,1,"Zero rating and non professional customer service!!!

I bought Toyota Auris hybrid from Inchcape Sandhurst. My experience with the whole processing of buying a car from Toyota approved dealer is extremely horrible.
Once we booked the car by paying the deposit the sales executive has no interest in any communications. I had to keep chasing the staff at Inchcape Toyota Sandhurst for each and every minute details from documents to receipt of payment and other related details for the car.
The day I went to collect the car, found scratch on rear bumper (which was not present when initially I viewed the car) and mark on front passenger door. I asked the sales person to remove this before I accept the delivery.
On delivery of the car the mark was not removed and till today I am in constant battle to get this sorted. The rear bumper was covered with protector and the sales executive is claiming that they provided it FREE even the damage was done on their site!!!!
The car comes with 145 points check list. Initially they used wrong inspection checklist sheet and on asking number of time, at last they provided 145 points check list for the same day, same person signing the checklist!!! HOW IS THIS VALID???
On separate note the person who is sales Executive have no respect for customer. Not bothered to address the customer with name, if by mistake writes the name is spelt wrong!!!
I did raised the complain at Toyota head office and no one has been in touch with me ever since.
Feel really frustrated and very bad experience of buying car from Toyota franchise.."

2021-03-16,1,"My partner bought a 2018 X5 online and was delivered to his office, the delivery driver then reversed the PX he had into the X5 outside office..
X5 went back to be repainted & came back three days with further damage where trade plate had flapped on rear number plate & two week later the repair they did on the bumper was noted that the paint had all bubbled up so obviously a quick job.

It was asked specifically if there was any minor damage to the vehicle & told not, once arrived glovebox had to be replaced & various other scratches around the car interior still to be resolved.
Vehicle also struggled to start twice, I guess that’s what you expect when you get a vehicle to have to take back to body shop & book in to workshop to get fixed?
Salesman very polite passed to retail manager who totally fobbed off for 10 days with empty promises.
Sales manager gets involved & decides that in his opinion that we have no grounds to reject a vehicle.
That’s where we are now, sad state of affairs from a main BMW agent best advice I can give use don’t use unless you want a headache.."

This lady is always extremely professional and is so customer orientated. She welcomes you and and instantly relaxes you as though you were talking to an old friend.

2021-03-11,5,"From my initial phone call, and all the way to sale completion and handover, my experience was remarkable and enjoyable. There was no sales pressure; my queries were handled patiently, honestly and promptly by the sales representative Jordan Carver. He was polite and confident of his facts, pointing out any pros and cons openly. Where he did not have information to hand he made effort to find out and relay to me promptly. The telephone receptionist and other staff I encountered briefly were courteous and cheerful. It was well worth traveling all the way from Surrey to Loughborough to collect the car. I would be happy to give full recommendations."
2021-03-10,1,"I booked my vehicle in online for an MOT with the option of a courtesy car for Saturday the 6th March at 10.30 am.
On the morning of the MOT I telephoned the 01937 number on my email to confirm that the MOT was booked and that a courtesy car was available. I was informed that no courtesy cars were given out on a Saturday but my vehicle was booked in. On arrival at the dealership in York I was left standing waiting to be seen for over 15 minutes outside the premises, to be greeted by a service advisor who then asked my name and returned into the premises, on return she informed me that my vehicle was not booked in on the system and who had I spoken to earlier to get the confirmation, I told her the name of the person and she explained that that person was not at their dealership, but they would carry out the MOT. To be honest I was ready at this point to go else where. Not what I expected from your organisation."

2021-03-09,4,"Overall process from booking in my lease car for a service and collecting it later gets 41/2 stars. The reception staff were very pleasant and friendly and the car was spotless when I collected it.
The only quibble was in collecting the car later when lots of other people were waiting, perhaps too many for the staff available to cope with."

Please don't buy any insurance or any add on from inchape salesmen they are top lies he told me Im buying guard x and he gave me guard x leaflet but he didnt sell me guard x he sold me something else with my car and when I try to use them insurance I wasnt covered very strange. So I called up inchape headoffice and spoke to Jane Lightowler. She tried to help me but as soon I start asking her questions about my purchase she couldn't answer my question and said I'm being rude by asking her question and she closed my case. SHE HAS NO CLUE PLUS They have no clue what is going on the office if you need any help you will have to wait 2 to 3 working days to get back with the information. I have bought a car and I have bought insurance with my car now I can't use them.

2021-03-08,5,"Excellent communication before, during and after my visit. Met onsite by friendly staff and they completed a quick handover of my car for work to be done.
I reckon Covid restrictions might make it difficult for some customers travelling to dealership due to not having access to customer toilets and other facilities etc. This is not the fault of dealership but would likely make it tricky for some customers, especially if they had mobility issues etc whereby they couldn't walk to nearby shopping centre."

Furthermore, the finance and to get the car to me took a week which was a shock as how fast a car can be sold.

Service, communication and aftersales were poor (taking Covid restrictions into account)

I've had better service from Aldi when I went back with a mouldy banana..and that didn't cost £30,000.

Don't recommend"
2021-03-07,1,"I took my car to have 2 wheel nuts replaced on the same wheel, Prior to that I asked for the quotation I was quoted £230 for both and there was a risk of damage to the alloy wheel in question, which accepted.
My final bill was £1586 instead of quoted £230 which did not include damage to the alloy wheel (+ £700).
During the repair, other parts were damaged such as Hub, bearing hub, carrier hub, driveshaft, The reason for this was that the vehicle was old and the parts were ''seized''.
The staff also refused to reflect on my bill that there was damage to the alloy wheel wrongly stating that there was no damage done to the alloy ( I have a copy of the correspondence with pictures showing the damage to the alloy and was quoted for that another £700).
I dispute the explanation for the increase. If I had been told that the age of the vehicle would result in extra expense I would not have gone ahead.
I have been badly treated"
2021-03-07,5,"Inchcape Mercedes Cheshire Oaks.


My wife and I have just bought our 5th Car from Mercedes at Cheshire Oaks, why do we go back apart from the fact that we like Mercedes cars is the excellent service you get, which quite simply we have never got from any other car dealership.

The general manager Tony knows his regular customers extremely well and makes a point if he sees you in the showroom of coming from his office to great you himself and speaking to his staff to make sure we are looked after. He follows this up throughout the process of you considering a new purchase. He is always open and honest when he gives you advice on any particular car.

We normally deal with Simon from sales who looks after us like a member of the family and makes sure the deal we receive is better than one offered elsewhere. We always do our due diligence on the cost of a particular car. Simon keeps you updated by text email and telephone calls, this time whilst he was working from home having caught Covid.

The third member of staff we had direct dealing with was the sales manager Dan, who provide extra support to assist Simon due to his illness. Dan did an exceptional job at obtaining the car we wanted at a price that was affordable to us.

From initial enquiry to collection everything was hassle free, nothing was too much trouble for the staff.

The whole team looked after us in such a way that I would give the highest recommendation for the showroom to anyone interested in buying a Mercedes.

Thanks to all the staff at the showroom but practically Simon, Dan and Tony."
2021-03-06,5,"It’s difficult buying a car in lockdown when you’ve only heard about it on YouTube! Particularly when you’re going from a diesel to an out and our electric!! However Phil (Litchfield) really helped make the experience as best it could be. From sharing videos and sending photos at each step of the way and always being available whenever I had questions. He really did go above and beyond!
On the day of collection, everything became a reality and I could finally have a drive. It was worth the wait! Phil had set everything up for me and it really was as good as he’d described. Thanks Phil"

Always polite and helpful."
2021-03-05,3,"Service overall was fair enough. Everyone was very pleasant to deal with but there were a couple of things which could’ve been better. It was very hard to get through to the service team at points with lengthy call waiting and bouncing back to reception, call backs didn’t always happen with updates, there were no courtesy cars available which meant as a family we were a little stuck for a few days but the dealership were calling and leaving messages very regularly when the warranty work was done and wanted a payment over the phone. Just details in the approach and execution which means I’m giving 3 stars and not higher."

2021-03-04,1,"During a recent service of my Q5, Tetbury Audi notified me that I needed to urgently replace the rear brakes, at the cost of £500, when in fact they were only 50% worn and rather than apologise and claim an error of judgement, they argued with me and told me this process was perfectly normal for them. Is this a strong indicator that this isn't an isolated incident and that other Tetbury Audi customers have spent money on work that was not required? I certainly think it does, especially when you consider that I'm not the first to make this claim about Tetbury Audi.

The headline facts are; The brakes did not require replacement, The job was falsely marked as urgent and requiring immediate attention.

But before I go into any more detail, I want to point out that I have clear evidence to validate the points and claims I make here and I'm quite happy to go over any of the points in more detail if required. I have also given Tetbury Audi many opportunities to resolve my dispute before getting to this stage, opportunities that they seem unwilling to take.

Direct communication has now ended with me receiving contact from their legal department, which was a surprise as I thought this was more of a customer service issue. If the intention of this was to scare me away or silence me, then it's not worked, I have nothing to fear, as I've already stated, I can validate all of my claims with the evidence that I've retained.

Here are some key points and facts.

1. The car underwent an MOT test (with an independent garage) less than 1 week before Tetbury Audi carried out the service, it passed the MOT and passed its braking performance tests with no issues or advisories.

2. The discs are worn to 50% (give or take a very small tolerance) with no signs of cracking, warping, overheating or excessive corrosion. This is based on the documented minimum thickness as provided by Audi, which I might add Tetbury Audi were reluctant to supply me with, despite a number of requests from me.

3. The vehicle is 5 years old and has covered 60,000 miles, with a current annual mileage of less than 10,000 miles, so all things being well, the discs could have as much as another 5 years and another 60,000 miles. Certainly not requiring urgent replacement and certainly not requiring replacement even before the next service or even the one after that.

4. Tetbury Audi have been invited to measure the discs at my house, but have declined the offer, sighting that it wasn't financially viable for them to visit me, despite their after sales manager already agreeing to collect my Q5 from my house and take it in to perform the valet that was not carried out during its last service.

5. I have provided photographic evidence of the measurements, but Tetbury Audi have not commented on the dimensions I've provided.

6. At no point of I received an apology or an admission that a mistake has taken place. So if it wasn't a mistake, then it could have only been intentional?

7. I did have the rear discs and pads replaced by an independent garage, but not because I believed they needed to be replaced, this was done so I could retain the discs and pads in the condition they were in when Tetbury Audi inspected them, therefore enabling a third party inspection to be taken place at a later date, if required. I did not have them replaced following advice from Tetbury Audi, had I have had them replaced at Tetbury Audi then the evidence of all of this would have vanished into the scrap metal bin, as I'm sure many others have already and may continue to do so.

I do feel this was all totally unnecessary and could have been avoided with a simple “Sorry, we made a mistake and here's how we'll put it right”, but this was never forthcoming. What's an even bigger shame is up until this point I was happy with them and I would have purchased our next car from them without hesitation.

Thanks for getting to the end, if you would like to know more, then please feel free to contact me directly."
2021-03-03,5,"Mercedes-Benz of North Wales were excellent in all ways and provided a first class service.
This I think is my 10th new car and was by far the easiest purchase process I’ve ever had.
Right from the initial enquiry, test drive and through to collection, everything was easy and hassle free, even during a very difficult period for us all.
All the paperwork was done remotely via an easy to Use platform.
I was kept updated regularly on my car, received photos when it arrived and a video a couple of days before it was ready to collect.
The car was immaculate on collection and the hand over was easy, enjoyable and exciting.
A service plan was arranged, a weeks complementary insurance and my ordered accessories were all in the car.
Well done to you all but especially Ben at Mercedes Benz of North Wales, a fabulous service and an amazing car."

2021-03-03,1,"After several phone calls to the service department, I am still waiting for a reply. There appears to be a culture of avoidance. Having been a customer for 30 years I feel the service department leaves a lot to be desired."
2021-03-03,1,"Ordered brand new vehicle - vehicle delayed by one week. When vehicle arrived could not drive as stuck in transport mode. Vehicle had to remain with dealer over the weekend. Pick vehicle up on Monday. Wind noise from passenger side and tapping noise. Take back in. Scuttle plate not fixed correctly and windscreen pillar trim damaged. Could not replicate tapping noise. Collect vehicle. Wind noise not resolved. Rebooked in but next appointment 6 weeks away - even with no loan car. Vehicle back in - drop on on Wednesday. No communication. Find out Thursday that needs new windscreen. Windscreen fit Friday afternoon and advised that tapping noise is related. I disputed this as the noise was clearly throttle related, which they had been told. Saturday morning I collect car and am told that service believe that the noise is throttle related but that they can’t look at it - needs rebooking in (for a 4th time) - still awaiting call to book this in. Wind noise is resolved however when driving on motorway windscreen trim has come off. Land Rover assist attended and said that the trim is damaged and so can’t go back on. Need to visit dealer for replacement trim. In addition, when investigating service have damaged the panel that covers the wiring loom in the passenger footwell - have to come back in to have it resolved.

In short I would never purchase another land rover, would never willingly visit inch cape and have been actively discouraging people from doing either.

If I thought I could return the vehicle, with a full refund, including costs of sorting private plates and admin charges then I would be tempted to pursue this Avenue. I am appalled by both the product and the service."
2021-03-03,4,"In my car there was dashboard notification to service the car, which wasn’t due for service.

Thank you guys!"
2021-03-03,1,"Really bad after sales service from Inchcape Landrover Derby. We bought a used Landrover Discovery and on collection found one of the locking wheel nuts was missing. Also the centre cupholders were broken. Both standard stock items, we were assured that they would be replaced and posted out to us and the cup holders fitted by our local dealer. Here we are nearly a month later and no sign of either despite phoning on an almost daily basis. First reason - the items were found abandoned in Parts Dept and would be on the way. Nothing. Next reason - the franking machine was broken (clearly can't take items to a post office). Next reason - waiting for us to pay for items that we had been told were FOC. Next reason - they are on the salesman's desk?? We cannot take the car out and leave it anywhere and risk a wheel theft. So after nearly one month we have a car sitting on the drive that we cannot use"

2021-03-02,1,"Inchcape Land Rover York Service centre: Absolutely dreadful customer service.
My Land Rover Discover Sport has done 69,000 miles and has been in on the back of a truck 4 times in 9 months. Every time it costs a small fortune and there is never even the slightest element of apology for the fact that this car is incredibly unreliable. This time when it went in, it was dropped off by the recovery truck but Inchcape denied it had arrived and I spent the morning chasing them to work out whether I had to call the police. In the end it was in their yard the whole time. Last time in was with them for 3 days before they even had a look at it and they told me that the problem was nothing to do with what the recovery man had advised. I got it back and it broke again within 2 weeks and had to be towed back to have done exactly what the recovery guy had said in the first place. Another time they charged £450 to effectively replace a rear fog light bulb/LED.
Two things are clear: I will not buy another modern Land Rover/Jaguar and I will never use Inchcape York, they just don't care enough to demonstrate any empathy towards you or recognition that they sold you a money pit with serious reliability problems. Dreadful."
2021-03-02,5,"my time at inchcape was very welcoming and friendly, the advisor was very helpful answered all my questions for my new car very good all round experience even under covid restrictions. i am very pleased with my new car"
2021-03-02,1,"Thank goodness for trustpilot after what has happened to me at least I can stop it from happening to others, You can try your best to make it look like you were trying to help when in fact you didn’t want anything to do with it hence why you ignored me totally when I complained about the fault In the 1st 2 months of having the car. If you wanted to do something about this YOU would have booked the car in with your technicians, diagnosed the fault and made it right. But you didn’t it’s been over a year of back and fourth letters and emails which you have done nothing about that is not professional and you broke the consumer law. It was your job to make it good after I reported it to you Rebecca holt and your STEALERSHIP.

We are now having to go through an ADR because of yours and your company’s incompetence. Once I reported the issues the onus was on you to look into it which you didn’t. Because you got your money for the car you didn’t want to help, if you did then then i wouldn’t be still sitting here and writing this 1 year later that’s the truth, it’s been over a year since I bought the car Rebecca.

Instead of asking the customer to do your work for you Rebecca holt you should know what the consumer law states, my jobs to report the fault your jobs to get it diagnosed and fixed. Which didn’t happen. I had to go to audi and get it diagnosed the report and repair costs which were sent to yours truly Rebecca holt declined and told me to use the warranty company which again like yourselves dishonest declined. Audi left me with the bill of repairs around £2500 and offered me goodwill on parts. Inchcape and Rebecca on the other hand have been asking for the good Will from Audi so they can maybe foot the Labour. Why would Audi give you the goodwill it wasn’t them that supplied a damaged and broken car in the first place. It was inchcape I paid the full price and I got salvage in return. If you want to be left in the dark and robbed of your hard earned cash then here’s a pit to burn your money called Inchcape.

Buying a car and then having to spend 1000s repairing it, is devastating to say the least. Please stay away from them it’s not worth the hassle, stress and headache or the financial loss. The customer service is rude unpleasant they want your money once they have It good buy and close the door behind you. Harry wormwoods garage isn’t far fetched from this place they both have a lot in common running STEALERSHIPS.

The reply’s that I’ve got have been nothing short of toilet paper hence why I’m still here a year later. You have wasted my time and money because of your ignorance and incompetence to deal with this matter professionally.

I am here to warn all those out there to please stay away if you want to burn your money light a campfire at least it’ll benefit you by keeping you warm, you won’t find any benefit spending it in Inchcape. There’s many other dealerships out there that value your custom that are honest and trustworthy take your business to them you might spend more but at least you won’t cry twice.

For all those that have gone through this horrific experience contact your bank under section 75 if you purchased through credit card or hire purchase you will be able to recoup your money. Stay away From this place."

I reached out to him again in February via email, he came across as slightly rude and uninterested. I was passed onto Aaron to complete the sale, this was disappointing as I would've expected to have dealt with the same person throughout the sale. Aaron was polite and friendly, he kept me up to date throughout the process which I appreciated massively. I did find it disappointing that throughout the process it felt very transactional, it did not feel like the salesman cared to find out anything about their customer, although I believe this may be typical of the car sales industry. I work in the luxury retail industry and pride myself on providing the very best customer service, I do not feel this was provided here. If the car was available elsewhere I would have bought it elsewhere. I was disappointed at the level of cleanliness in the car, I was very disappointed that the car has a very obvious rattle inside of the car when being driven. Overall the purchase felt very transactional and I will not be purchasing from this branch again."
2021-03-01,5,"All the staff are Polite; Pleasant and Professional.
Great communication through the day
Massive Thank you to all the staff for their help"
2021-03-01,5,"The retail and repair teams are both great. Equally attentive and dedicated to solve any problem. From purchase a tyre pressure alarm was activating every time I got in, so each trip started via a trip to the garage for tyre pressure checks. I telephoned the sales team who quickly made an appointment for the vehicle to be looked at within a few days. Due to COVID restrictions I couldn’t wait inside but this was no issue as a nearby coffee shop was open. Within 2 hours I was assured the tyre and the system were functioning properly. However, the next time I got in to drive, the warning alarm was on again. I drove to the garage and was dealt with very efficiently, with apologies and an appointment made for 3 weeks time. After expressing concern at the length of time I was promised the issue would be passed to a manager to review. True to word the following day I was contacted and asked to bring the vehicle in 2 weeks sooner.
On the allotted day I arrived, car left and I had brought a blanket to sit and read, outside. Someone kindly brought me a chair. Within 90 minutes or so the vehicle was returned. The problem being identified as the wheel, not tyre, or system. It had been fixed and I’ve had no problems since.. You may think that this should be a negative review as 2 visits were required, however the professionalism of the staff is 5*. I like them because they don’t over promise and under deliver like other garages I have used."
2021-03-01,5,"Did click and collect in 3 days flat,exceptional service and the car was exactly as described. Richard Stephenson was first rate an a real asset to MB Oxford."
2021-03-01,5,very polite and efficient service
2021-03-01,5,"Excellent customer service from start to finish loan car was very lovely and sporty didn’t want to hand it back
Wanted to try electric loan car but another customer got to it before me
Everything my car was booked in for was dealt with and George was a pleasure to deal with 😊 a very happy customer!"
2021-03-01,5,"Picked up my new A class today which was all arranged by Mark Rushen. Mark did an excellent job for me sourcing the car, getting it delivered and keeping me informed. Due to the current climate ( Covid ), I was expecting some hiccups along the way but thanks to Mark it all ran smoothly. I wasn't constantly badgered by him or overwhelmed, and by coming in on his day off enabled me to receive my car earlier. Overall everything was dealt with swiftly and efficiently leaving it stress free for me, and with thanks to Mark who went out of his way help I had a very positive experience with them. Very helpful, professional and welcoming."

We would like to share your experience on the review sites below.

I was given a quote of work required to be undertaken on the car and I had specifically asked what the total was that I would be paying on the day. The worker advised an amount on the phone but when paying on collection, had added £240 on for the service. I made clear my frustration that I had asked for the total on the phone and therefore would have expected a 'total amount' to be just that. I am surely not the only person who expects a total sum to know what they are paying. Any decent customer service assistant would say the TOTAL amount, even going so far as to say total for work plus the service.It is common sense; seemingly lacking here. This place is a rip off and I will not be returning. I will ensure I tell all my friends and family the same (I have already shared on social media)."
2021-03-01,1,"Left the car on Monday for service and MOT, and had to wait until Thursday to have it ready. They ordered wrong part, but possibly existing part could have been repaired or adjusted. Promised reduction in MOT , but this was not done. Had to pay nearly £400 in total"
2021-03-01,5,Friendly staff good service under the conditions.
2021-03-01,5,This was my first visit to Mercedes-Benz Stratford and I have to say they were first class thank you
2021-02-26,2,"Very poor experience with dealership 1st time I had car serviced, very different experience with sales team when buying the car !

If you want me to reply with my registration details you will need to contact the vw dealership in Chester, I must be driving a different car as every time they asked me what my registration was they kept telling me it could not be that as there system did not show it was that, maybe they could also contact DVLA and put them right

2021-02-26,5,"Experience visit to Stratford-on-Avon mercedes, professional, friendly, very helpful.
This is genuine, other manufacturers could take a leaf out of Stratford-on-Avon book."
2021-02-26,5,Car due for a service. My regular garage was unable to book anything in for six weeks. Inchcape were able to do it within days. Excellent service and would be happy to recommend them and use them again
2021-02-26,4,All went well but 4 days later still awaiting bodywork estimate and answer to query on warranty claim
2021-02-26,5,"Very well organised pick up and drop off at Mercedes Warrington. At my request Jennifer provided details of various service plans from which I picked one, and with which I am very happy."
2021-02-26,5,Excellent. Very courteous and efficient whilst maintaining the highest Covid-19 safety measures. I am very impressed
2021-02-26,5,"My car was booked in for a service and it's first MOT. Due to the service center's new COVID measures, I was able to check in from home, leave my car in the parking area, pay from home, and pick up my car from the parking area with minimal interaction. It was great!"
2021-02-26,1,"I have made several trips and left my car for days at the dealership . If they are not able to resolve then this under warranty car must be reported to the manufacturer by the dealership. I contacted manufacturer. My car is back at dealership and no resolve. It’s been over a week. Know nothing except that my car is under use by one of the mechanic to drive from work to home to find faults. On every visit I have been given a verbal detail of work which they carried out detailing a long list of nox sensor replacement. Unfortunately after every visit in a day or two warning lights are back. Mercedes manufacturer should be ashamed of producing such a mess. I am looking at other ways to register my complaints. Dealership is not assisting and I am not given full account of their work carried out on my car. I am not getting customer care support. It’s been over a week since the car is left at dealership and I have no clue what they are doing.
Story does not end here. Now my care is at the same Mercedes dealership in Warrington since 12th of February. Its been nearly two months. My calls were directed to different people every time without getting any result. Finally i spoke to Managing Director Craig Gibbson, he promised to resolve this matter and would contact the Mercedes manufacturer to arrange a replacement car as this seems beyond repairs. Now whenever i phone to get update, the receptionist says that no one is there to take my call.
Warranty is due to expire in August 2021.Are they waiting for this to happen. My car registration is HN18KUG.
I am ready to take legal action.
Anyone reading this please advise."
2021-02-24,1,I found a car I was interested in from Inchcape Jaguar York. I called and spoke to the most arrogant salesman ever. Simply rude and unhelpful. When you fail at the first hurdle trying to buy a car it’s a sure warning sign to walk away. If this is the pre sales experience I dread to think what could be to come at the after sales stage! Prevention is better than cure so I’d strongly recommend you avoid this struggling PLC.
2021-02-24,1,In February 2021I booked a Landrover Discovery into Chester following receipt of a safety recall from Landrover. Over a week after booking the vehicle in Inchcape Chester phoned to say they couldn't do the necessary work as they didn't have the tools and told me to go elsewhere! Incredible-and not for the first time
2021-02-24,5,"a big thank you to Joe Pender at Inchcape Preston for seeing us through the purchase of our second vehicle from Inchcape. Even at these difficult times, Joe made sure everything was sorted out for us. Fantastic work Joe!"
2021-02-23,1,"After purchasing my range rover sport as an exdemo with 11600 miles, at 25600 mile it has suffered the well documented manufacturing defect cam bearing failure causing the engine to seize..rebecca from customer services/aftersales has been very unhelpful leaving me with a huge bill for the replacement engine...beware!!!!

Rebecca your facts are incorrect as the goodwill was initially started by the repair garage 20% and was only via the motor ombudsman who stated I should pursue the originating purchase garage i did contact inchcape who then managed to up the claim to 60% still leaving me with a £5800 bill because of a manufacturing defect !!!
Also the mechanics working on the car stated the serial number of the engine is affected by this service bulletin
But basically your stating an engine failure at 25600 miles is ok !!
There is no gaps in the service history the only discrepancy is when inchcape had the car as the demo and had serviced it early.
Update... landrover paid another 20% towards the new engine because the service bulletin does affect my engine."
2021-02-23,5,It was very good to come and get are new car
2021-02-23,5,Excellent service and all COVID protocols monitored and observed. Picking up our new car was a pleasant and risk free experience.
2021-02-23,1,"Mini in general as a whole are a joke, i am never going to buy from them again, when i placed a complaint with the croydon group, they waited until close of play Friday to tell me Cobham had to deal with it as they are owned by inchcape, i was at first happy with the service but after a few days they obviously didn’t want to know me, i emailed countless times for updates from the manager dealing with me and got maybe 2 replies, could never get through on the phone. Did what absolutely had to be done but still didn’t care and when i still advised that I wasn’t happy with everything they just didn’t care. I hade these below issues with the car within 7 months of buying it (i paid over £12,300) not what you expect from an actual mini dealership:

- lightbulb went straight away had to go back to get changed
- within 4 months had to get 2 new tyres
- within 4 months had to get new windscreen wipers and need new one for the rear now 7 months after purchasing
- passenger window issue (was sold with the car) they had to replace the motor on the window so it actually worked
- engine oil pump needed replacing after an engine light came up a couple of times (just said engine oil pressure low do not drive)
- sun roof had been making a loud noise whenever opening from purchasing the vehicle.
- the windscreen washer filter had to be cleared out within a couple of months as the windscreen washer pump was not working.

I will also note that i had no car for a month when the oil issue came up, firstly croydon fobbing me off then Cobham taking ages to fix the issue, never once offered me a courtesy car. This whole experience has seriously put me off EVER buying a used car again, i will either lease a car or buy a cheap run around now, so much money has gone to waste, i will now be selling the car at a huge loss as I don’t trust nothing else will go wrong, i asked for mini to buy it back and they simply said they are not in need of cars so they wouldn’t be able to buy it.

Happy to take your money but never want to know after! I will also point out, i had to pay for the windscreen washer fluid, wipers, tyres and pay for a mechanic to check out other issues, this car has caused nothing but problems if I'm honest."
2021-02-22,5,Have got a fantastic deal on and amazing car... absolutely love it! Phil was a pleasure to deal with and made the whole process really straightforward. Thank you 😊
2021-02-22,5,"We bought this car without even seeing it. Great Service, efficient and friendly. We were kept fully informed and the car was ready when we arrived to collect it. Would definitely recommend. Thanks Tom!"
2021-02-22,5,Great service and friendly staff!!
2021-02-22,5,It worked well
2021-02-21,2,"This review has not been posted in error it is factual & true, full details provided to Mercedes Loughborough as requested in their reply I await further contact & will update my trust pilot review - Original posting reads - Purchased a GLE 400 D Jan 2021, 1week after, headlights internally are suffering from extreme condensation to the point of water running down the lens & settling within the unit. Took photos, returned to dealer & spoke to Danny from service, who proceeded to tell me this was normal & his girlfriends A class sufferers the same, not a very convincing or professional explanation. I suggested that this was not a bit of condensation but water running down the inside of the sealed headlight unit, look at the photos I’ve taken do you not see it or believe me? under duress Danny somewhat reluctantly booked the vehicle in for an inspection ( More on that later as this issue is not resolved yet ) I also asked Danny to enquire with Mercedes Uk if this was a known issue, after sometime he returned with a print out stating this is a known issue & Mercedes Uk authorise the replacement of the headlight units if the condensation is extreme. So the vehicle is returned to the dealership, with the outcome that all is satisfactory no problem found. Having spoken directly with Mercedes-Benz Customer Service & emailing over the photos I was information that each dealership has an undisclosed budget from Mercedes Uk to resolve similar issues, that the dealership is paid by Mercedes Uk for any warranty work carried out. So the big question is will Inchcape Loughborough replace the headlights?
I will further update you on progress & additional information of which I am unable to disclose as this dispute is on going, But be reassured I will. In the meantime I’d strongly suggest if considering purchasing a premium brand car is headlight condensation a know issue, do a google search there are several videos, make your own mind up, the salesman’s not going to tell you."
2021-02-18,5,Have just purchased a new A250e from Mercedes in Nottingham. Phil Litchfield was extremely helpful and his unwavering approach to making sure all was in order meant that I could pick the car up within 48hours of ordering it! Love the car and can’t recommend Phil and this dealership enough for anyone in the market for one. Extremely conscientious and excellent customer service... only trouble is that my wife now wants one!
2021-02-17,1,"Really unimpressed with Chelmsford Branch.
The icing on the cake was calling to ask for complaints email address to be put through to the woman I’m needing to make a complaint about to then have her put me through to care car plan. She did this twice. They all seem throughly unprofessional I did finally manage to raise a formal complaint and this part of my complaint was ignored by Glen Berry so I emailed him again and no reply. They say on their calls while your on hold that they have 5 star trust pilot review but this isn’t correct either."
2021-02-15,1,"I had been a loyal customer of 12 years until my recent experience with Inchape Shrewsbury. Everything is great whilst you're looking to purchase a vehicle or sign up to a PCP deal, however anything else and your calls and emails are ignored, even after calling the showroom multiple times. Asked to speak to the manager twice and was told he was on his lunch both times. That would perhaps be understandable if the 2 calls weren't 3 hours apart on the same day!!!

The garage have missed out on future custom too, having not returned my calls, I will take out a finance deal elsewhere."
2021-02-14,1,"Partner bought a car from Inchape and the service has been dreadful. The car came stinking of smoke (despite being an ex-demonstrator). The floor mats were ripped (the car was 6 months old). There was also a dent in the drivers door sill that wasn't mentioned/noticed. All of this could have been explained over the phone, email and via the video sent but wasn't. Either lack of detail or just bad salesmanship and poor service. You be the judge.
The sales team aren't interested in the simple admin like refunding a deposit to a customer. It's been over two weeks now and still no confirmation of how or when this will be refunded. Still waiting on various other admin queries such as P11D value and finance completion documents. Funnily enough the staff were keen to phone regularly to get handover paper work completed.
The initial sales service was pretty poor as well considering they try all the old tricks of offering below market value for a trade in then miraculously they can give you supagard when they bump up the trade in price (do keep an eye on your invoice as this will always be a charge for this!) I've sold paint protection before and instead of selling the benefits of the product this was more of a ""I'll give you this because I have to hit a target."" Maybe that tells you about their faith in the product or the lack of skill in their sales team?
Partner was told that 6 months road fund licence would be included, then when the car was being transported to us recieved a phone call asking for the RFL. When the sales person admitted their error they didn't try to resolve it and just insisted there was nothing they could do. Manager then confirmed the was nothing they could/would do an ms that the full tank of fuel that has been agreed previously was all enough of an apology. This was all blamed on the staff member being new, Google reviews say they've been there at least 4 months. Again though you'd expect a trainee to be trained and given help by other staff/a manager rather than just dropped in at the deep end.
Also a suspicion that the sales person wrote down my partners card number to ""tax it later"". Which shouldn't be be done under FCA and GDPR guidelines.
Bizarrely enough they even tried to explain that the Road fund licence ran out in the middle of the month and that they would send out the V5 document once the handover paperwork was completed. V5 is sent out by the DVLA and road fund licence runs for a calender month. Assume this is either a tactic to get paperwork completed our they're horrifically unaware of how these processes work.
A complaint was put into Inchape but completely ignored so don't hold your breath of you ever buy a car and need a problem resolved. Even during covid you'd expect to hear something back. Is this due to the huge amounts of complaints or do they just not care?
Nearly 3 weeks still waiting on refund of deposit back. Also the tellusmore email address doesn't work."
2021-02-13,5,"Just purchase a new Mercedes shooting brake from Mercedes of Nottingham.
Sale person Phil was very helpful through out from start to finish. Any issues or problems was on them straight away till they was solved.Excellent service, kept you updated with the movement of car.Will be using Phil again on my next purchase. Thank you very much on the pleasant journey, much appreciated."
2021-02-13,5,Phil was very helpful and courteous through every step of buying the car. A pleasure to deal with. I would be very happy to buy a car from Phil next time round.
2021-02-08,1,"Inchcape kings Lynn. Landrover
Range Rover sport requires new engine. Warranty only just expired. Been calling them 3 x last year to be told they were closed. Lockdown. Now they expect me to pay for it. After sales is shocking. Now no car and no one answering."
2021-02-07,5,Excellent service
2021-02-06,1,"Terrible service. Had a service booked. They called me to cancel due to the lockdown. I asked if they were closed, they said no we're open but can't service your car as I need collection. I work in hospital and due to covid can't get time off to go and service my car which I need to get into work (I live 50 miles away from the hospital). So much for thanking the NHS, what a load of rubbish. They also say they will charge for pickup and collection. This will be the last time I take my car to inchape. Useless."
2021-02-06,1,"Dreadful and shambolic describe my experience of Inchcape Swindon. Communications with sales person and business manager were poor. Simple questions took an age to answer, it was difficult to have confirmation of the cars specification. The car was poorly prepared, no owners manual, no infotainment manual and the cleaning / Gardx looked like it had been done by a 5 year old. The sales person appeared to have very little knowledge of cars. The car had significantly more miles on it than was advertised. I was sent a completed Handover document 35 minutes before the handover took place, most boxes were ticked indicating that they were completed. In reality, few of the handover items on the list were done. I have had to chase for news of when I would receive the Infotainment manual and roof bars. I was given the impression that the roof bars would be available when collecting the car, however it appears that there is a significant delay in the getting them.
I suggested that a senior person within Inchcape might want to contact me, but after a week no contact has been made.
On arrival at the site for the handover, there was inadequate signage and the staff appeared to have little or no interest in 'customer service' - in stead they looked like they wanted to hide inside.

Received a reply this morning (08/02/21). I have to say there is nothing more insulting than receiving a cut'n'paste response to a complaint. It just confirms that Inchcape are not interested in resolving issues. They are probably just assuming that 8% of their reviews are made up or not warranted."
2021-02-06,1,Don't bother - aftersales is appalling. All encouragement when they want a sale but if you have issues with the car (as I did - the car arrived with poor paint job and not cleaned properly - also tyres low in pressure and flat battery) the dealership - INCHCAPE VW MACCLESFIELD in my case - may well not be interested in putting things right. They were not interested in properly looking into my issues with car. I had a much better experience at a smaller garage a year ago - suggest you might want to read the reviews carefully and find a 5-star one of those.
2021-02-05,1,Never got a refund on my deposit although they decided not to sell me the car because after a mechanical inspection they spotted an oil leak. Although I made several calls I always got the same answer “we’ll look into it”
2021-02-05,1,My partner Baught a car from inch cape York used cars and baught the extended warranty. we naw have problems with it try to deal with it through warranty and there is no garage around the area that will deal with it and every time we ring inch cape we keep getting fobbed off and told to ring somebody else and so on it’s getting an absolute joke. I wouldn’t recommend getting extended warranty or even using inch cape.
2021-02-02,5,Great service from Stewart and the team first class as always
2021-02-02,5,I part exchanged my BMW Yasmin at Coopers in Colchester could not have been more helpful and efficient. I can highly recommend.
2021-02-01,1,"REPLY RESPONSE:
Thanks for your reply. The declaration 'sold as seen' is open to interpretation according to my legal team, due to the Coronavirus epidemic. The cars cannot be inspected so it is not a public auction. Specific area pertaining to this is the Consumer Contract and Information Cancellation and additional charges regulations. Additionally there is always the Consumer Rights Act.

Additionally the car had an inspection service with yourselves two months prior to selling it. Why would you put a healthy car through an auction when you could sell it yourselves for a greater margin.

As you can see I don't normally post reviews but I wanted to post this so that other people have a balanced view when deciding whether to buy from yourselves. The issue is whether yourselves or BCA are at fault.

-------------------------------------------------------------

I bought a car from Inchscape via auction for 20k.

The car had an obvious coolant leak from the get go. It was located under the intake manifold, which was confirmed by Audi.

This was not declared.

I can be contacted by trustpilot or Inchscape to verify."

2021-01-26,5,Very helpful when I was advised to drive to my garage as my AA rescuer thought it was my alternator not my battery. Dave was very accommodating despite it being close to service department closing time on a Saturday. Emily was very helpful and understanding when arranging for the work to be done.
2021-01-25,5,Excellent customer service - can’t fault the team at Colchester - would definitely recommend

Looking forward to receiving the same standard of professionalism from your service team in the future."

I was extremely pleased with the way the staff treated me. I had a courtesy car and was given a weekly update until my car was ready. Collected yesterday. All done, car cleaned and valeted, I felt a valued customer every step of the way. Thanks particularly to Stuart."
2021-01-20,5,"I traded in my old Audi A1 for an A3 just before Christmas at Stockport Audi.
Few hiccups in communication etc with salesman but eventually picked up the car. Fault light appeared first day was told normal call breakdown but light went out. Next day same fault plus engine management light couldn’t get thru to Audi so breakdown called. On testing car it appears some part of the engine hadn’t been pushed back into place and was loose hence warning lights. After emailing salesman he got car booked in for thorough check and both Danny and Lisa were fantastic at looking after me and making up for all the inconvenience. These things can happen but wasn’t happy with the service given at the time and these two fantastic staff made sure I was looked after.
Thanks again

The salesman Rik was helpful enough, considering the new restrictions and the actual buying process and collection of the car was fine. The issues came afterwards. We collected the new car on Sunday 20th December. Today is the 13th January, the balance on my previous car has still not been settled, even though I have been assured numerous times since swapping the car that it is settled. I have therefore paid an extra payment on a car I no longer own and a payment will go out for my new one in the same month. Just what you need! I am also still waiting for a refund on a deposit that I paid to the dealership just to secure the car. No idea what the hold up is with this as it was paid to the dealership on a card and not to VW finance themselves. Absolutely shocking service. The salesman himself has dealt with our frustrations quite well and I am aware that this isn't his fault, but a fault of someone within the team, however its just not good enough and not the service I have come to expect over the years."

2021-01-11,5,"I purchased a new AMG from Mercedes of Nottingham, from Phil Litchfield - excellent service from Phil, he has helped myself and my father purchase two Mercedes with great deals and service all round. Phil matched my quote and went above and beyond with providing essential extras as part of the package. Really very happy with my purchase and Phil ensured that we had the best collection experience possible for both cars. I highly recommend Mercedes of Nottingham & Phil to anyone looking to purchase a new car from Mercedes. Friendly, professional and incredible service - we will most definitely be back again (and again)!"
2021-01-11,1,"Very Poor Service from Inchape VW Swindon....no option for ZERO STARS...

I was left waiting outside in -2degC at Inchape VW Swindon waiting for an extended time for the repair on my car. After dropping the car off at the agreed time of 1030am I underlined to a VW colleague that because this is simple and a very quick repair I need the car back at 1130am to be able to get back home for my important 12pm conference call. The VW employee reassured me that it would be done and to come back from my freezing walk at 1120am so we can do the paperwork and I can be on my way at 1130am as agreed. To my horror at 1120am on my return the car is still sat where I left it and it hadn’t been touched. This is obviously very disappointing and a waste of additional time in these freezing conditions. Making customers wait an additional amount of time outside is ridiculous and inhumane.
If the car was not available to be looked at for nearly an hour then I should have been informed when I dropped the car off as I wouldn’t have left it.

Covid-19 cannot be used as an excuse, as I work with many suppliers and customers who offer a continued excellent customer experience throughout this pandemic.

If VW have a set time for customers to drop their car off in these difficult times then the car should be looked at immediately or soon after and if you have additional sanitisation or systems to undertake then you need to space the bookings out or become more efficient.

This whole morning has been a complete write off me and my business and I can’t afford to waste additional time waiting for Poor VW service.

I was also given the customer service manager email details which seem to be incorrect as the mail has bounced back hence posting on Trustpilot."
2021-01-10,5,"Excellent service! I travel half hour to the Nottingham branch as I have had customer service issues with my local one. Cannot fault anything, will be taking my vehicle there from now on! Amazing service guys!"

Despite 4 emails & 2 phone calls regarding the whereabouts of the order I received no replies at all.
Having contacted their head office they couldn't supply a phone no. for their online retail section as they didn't know. Eventually after a month the item arrived and guess what, it was the wrong size. Appalling customer service will never use again."

Disputed with aftersales manager who has deliberately ignored my correspondence for 7 weeks. Do NOT trust the technicians here at all, check EVERYTHING they tell you before you hand over any money."
2021-01-06,1,"Inchcape Chester is the worst garage I have ever come across.i have had so many complaints with them I could write a book,thy don’t reply to any complaints you make."
2021-01-06,1,Absolute liars. They have accused me of threatening and violent behaviour (without proof). Have damaged my car. Overcharged me. Added leaks to my car. All because their insecure representative Naim Islam - Got angry I escalated my service to head office(As it had taken 20 days to get a response from him). Absolutely Jokers. I have passed this information on to trading standard/my local mp and my bank.
2021-01-05,5,"Well ... where do I start , firstly I can’t thank Phil Litchfield enough from Mercedes Nottingham , helping me sort out my mobility car , he went above and beyond to help me as I had been messed around with another car company who let me down with my motorbility vehicle , Phil came to the rescue , and got me my independence and sanity back by sorting me a motorbility vehicle out , he listened thoroughly at what I wanted and for my needs and he sure did deliver .. I’m one happy customer THANK YOU VERY MUCH ..... also got my personal registration sorted for me before I got there"

Considering the current situation (tier 3) i can not praise Inchcape Jaguar & Louise Ganley enough for the service we received - 1st class service selling a great product also a fair price given for my part exchange vehicle (Jaguar XF 3.0 diesel luxury - 2011)
I would not hesitate to recommend this dealership and the people that work there very friendly and professional in what they do - WELL DONE INCHCAPE"
2020-12-28,3,"Drive in service was good given the current circumstances. Inchape have made good steps to make you feel safe such as the socially distanced chairs and desks.
Unfortunately upon attending to pick up my car after the work being completed I was left to sit at a desk for approximately ten minutes if not longer whilst other customers whom arrived after me were being served. Not once did a member of staff come to check up on or me and when my keys were finally passed back to me there was not an apology for the delay.
It was a shame as the gentlemen who initially spoke to me on arrival was polite and helpful."

Actually need to forward purchase a shooting brake, but wasn't even asked if I had any further requirements. Faulty tyre also, but hadn't the time to mess around taking to dealer as they didn't have stock of a replacement and Exeter weren't interested. Unfortunately, wont be recommending this garage."

2020-12-17,1,"Just to update on this issue we still have not received a service book and the ""tellusmore"" email address doe not exist . . . so not easy to make complaints!. . . My 77 year old mum bought a used Polo from Inchcape Chester, it was all great until we paid for the car and then any support following this has been dreadful. The car was sold to us with all the service requirements complete and with an MOT but when collected this hadn’t been done as they were apparently done 2 months earlier by another Inchcape branch. The Service book didn’t reflect this so it was sent off for an update but 12 weeks later I am still waiting for the book. What a shambles will never deal with Inchcape VW again, during these difficult times my mum can do without all this hassle. . . Shame on you Inchcape!!"

Jess is parts is extremely helpful and friendly and deserves a raise!

BE WARNED! This place will mis-sell parts from the service team just to make money, they mistreat staff and have no regards for data protection.

Tyres are cheaper elsewhere (Micheldever tyres) and the workshop controller is a nasty piece of work.

Roundup is don’t bother going, they will mis-sell, con you and laugh about it afterwards."

Jamie Lloyd is fantastic and was able to find me a cancelled build slot, help me with spec decisions and surprised me with an early delivery! Jamie kept me updated the whole way along and was very proactive when it came to signing all the docs. I was especially impressed with how this dealership coped with all the COVID-19 restrictions. Ipswich Mini is not my local dealership but after 2 brilliant experiences with them i’d go no where else. Thank you Ipswich Mini & Jamie Lloyd!"
2020-12-15,2,I did not visit Mercedes Benz of derby it was the COVENTRY branch. I felt like because my my car was 10 years old and it wasn’t a £80k amg they wasn’t interested of giving me the full Mercedes experience! When I booked my C class in I was offered a free health check and to install Mercedes me app module to my car witch I got told they don’t do the health check on recalls and the module never got fitted. Also I felt that I wasn’t being will informed when they had my car for such a long time just for this recall etc. On the plus side I did get to drive a lovely new a class thank you.
2020-12-14,5,"A great experience from start to finish.

I'm a difficult customer sometimes, I have to admit.

Despite this, my experience with Inchcape was excellent. They went above and beyond the normal to make sure my car purchase was as smooth as possible.

From helping me out when I had a problem with insurance cover expiring too soon on the old car, to making sure I was able to collect the car in perfect condition when I wanted. Phil did everything he could to help out.

Thank you! A grateful if annoying customer :)"

2020-12-14,5,Great service from Sam Pullin. Really helpful and extremely easy to deal with.
2020-12-14,1,Bought a Jaguar XE in August at Inchcape in Preston through a Guernsey broker. The car was originally advertised by Inchcape in Guildford. Even though the dealer knew the car was leaving the UK to be shipped to Guernsey they still didn’t leave the logbook in the car and claim to have sent it to the DVLA. The DVLA website clearly states not to do so. Anyway after 4 months we still don’t have a logbook and can’t transfer the registration. Anytime we contact someone at Inchcape is like we’re hitting a wall. Is it really so hard to get this document and mail it?!
2020-12-13,1,Very poor service at inchcape York landrover and wouldn’t touch them again .I took my Defender in to get some warranty work done and they dented both wings and would not admit responsibility. I won’t buying new cars from these anymore
2020-12-12,5,I had the best experience. It was my first time buying a car and Phil made the experience so easy and stress free. The process was straight forward and simple. Phil was very easy to communicate with and has great customer service. He went through everything with me and made sure I was confident with the car before taking it home with me. Would highly recommend.
2020-12-11,5,My vehicle went in to have a service and oil leak repair. Everything was done to high standard and I was kept informed throughout until the vehicle was ready to collect. Staff in reception were very helpful and friendly. 5 star all around
2020-12-10,1,"Buyer beware.
If you are buying a used car from this company please make sure you double check any paperwork before you sign it. If you speak to a salesperson and agreed something, make sure the paperwork contains what you agreed to.

Look out for :
extras not agreed
Mileage not as advertised
Interest rates higher than suggested
Loan term longer than offered with the salesperson


Do yourself a favour and make sure you know your rights before dealing with this company."
2020-12-10,1,"Bought a used 2017 Ford kuga off the cowboys at Inchcape Telford. Rear heated screen was not working properly so I was asked by the sales manger Chris Briggs to take it into my nearest ford garage for a diagnostic test and they would refund me my £47.50 the next day. No refund was paid and 9 MONTHS later still not had it,(THIEVES) they did eventually replace the rear screen.
I was also given at time of sale 12 months extra warranty starting after my manufacturers warranty ran out, they said I would receive the papers for that, one month before it ends, same again I haven’t received no papers for the extra warranty.
DON’T try and speak to the sites GENERAL MANGER to complain as advertised on there web site as SHE won’t and can’t be bothered to return any phone calls.

If anybody would like to contact me from Inchape I would happily provide all corresponding EMAILS between me and your so called sales manager Chris Briggs which states Inchcape would refund my money and also about the warranty. HE WAS FULL OF PROMISES BUT didn’t deliver.

I will never BUY a car from Inchcape EVER AGAIN.

VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM."

2020-12-09,1,"I'm writing to highlight my disappointment having received positively appalling service from you.

I am a company driver of the above vehicle and had a basic service at Inchcape Bury Greater Manchester on 17-11-20.

Upon arrival at the garage I was informed that there was a recall on the vehicle and that they intended to work on the high performance battery and solar cell.
I was charged £250.00 for the service.

Since leaving the dealership the vehicle has been juddering and this afternoon an amber warning light has appeared on the dashboard.

I contacted the dealership to be told that they had not in fact done the repair and that they could book me in to another branch twenty miles away where they would need to have the vehicle for at least two days.The next available appointment being THURSDAY 7TH JANUARY 2021 !!!!!!

Therefore I feel compelled to ask:

Are your vehicles so unreliable that there is a queue to get them repaired stretching into early next year ?

Do you consider this to be good customer service ?

Is it safe to drive an almost new defective vehicle until your dealerships can bother to do the jobs that should have been done in November ?

My wife and I are due to change our car in the next few months and have been impressed by your Touareg Model. Why would we not stay with Volvo ?


I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards.

2020-12-07,1,"I am very disappointed with the service from Inchcape Burton on Trent (Toyota). I reserved a Toyota Auris FH16DHK, 06 Dec at 13.05 PM and received a call from the dealer at 13.12 that they already sold the car the day before to someone else and the person was coming to collect it on the next Wednesday.
I told the person on the phone that if it is sold then they should have removed it from the website; it was marked as reserved after I reserved it.
The person told me there is an issue with the website and they cannot do anything.
I requested her to refund my reservation money, she told me she does not know how the online reservation system worked and did not give a refund. A big waste of money and very horrible service..."

Asked if I wanted to choose something else, then they offered a lower specification model in a different colour.

I was offered a £200 refund which I agreed to, but despite repeated e-mails & phone calls I still haven't received the £200

From the very first contact, everything felt controlled, smooth and I didn’t feel overpowered or pressured to get a car that I didn’t want. I thought doing this online (covid) as opposed to face-to-face would be tricky as you’re not able to see the car properly or test drive it but I had many videos, lots of emails and phone calls with the team.

2020-11-21,1,"Purchased a six-month old Land Rover from Inchcape. Engine warning light came on during the journey home. Called Inchcape, who advised me to call Land Rover Assist. Land Rover Assist came out and looked at the vehicle and advised the problem was most likely a filter and that it should be dealt with by the dealer. The vehicle then went back and forth with Inchcape, with six separate appoints over a three month period to no avail. On the fifth time I took the vehicle in I pointed out that I had noticed a crack on the panoramic roof; Inchcape volunteered that they may be able to replace the glass, and the Customer Service Manager confirmed and shook my hand on the fact that he would indeed replace it. After my sixth visit with the engine problem, the Customer Service Manager phoned me and said “there is a problem with the panoramic window, I’ll get someone to call you”. He then had one of his minions call me and say that Inchcape were no longer willing to cover the glass.
I ultimately took the vehicle to Gordon Lamb Land Rover in Chesterfield; they replaced the filter first time as originally diagnosed and solved the issue. Jaguar Land Rover themselves contributed 50% of the cost of the panoramic roof (Inchcape were unwilling to match them)."
2020-11-18,1,"This is addition to the review I posted last Sunday, as I thought it couldn’t get any worse. I was walking to my car yesterday after doing my usual school drop off in the morning and noticed something loose on one side just underneath the bumper, firstly thought is was just a leaf that had just got stuck underneath, when I got to my car and had a proper look, it was a loose part plastic guard that hadn’t been screwed back onto the underneath engine cover, I checked the other side and surprisingly the other side was the same, I was beginning to think is it really worth paying all this extra money to a proper dealership and getting cowboy service and workmanship, qualified VW technicians can put back screws in the same place where they took them off from. So I called the garage told them I was happy about the overall service I got, and it was one thing after another and they seem to not know what they are doing, I explained I travel out of my way to their garage because I’ve had really poor experience from other dealerships and because now their cowboy technician I have to travel back to their garage, especially during lockdown. I explained I’m a key worker and advised them what time I can take it back to the garage, I wasn’t happy about having to take more time when it should have been sort in the first place. I told the advisor I think it’s reasonable to ask for the cost of my fuel back as it’s out off my way, he put me on hold and he said he had spoke to his manager and he would have to check my car and I would have to waiting in the car park while the problem is getting sorted and they would drive my car to a garage to put some fuel back in for me. I hope you understand for a service and extra work that I paid to get done, as I customer that pays the extra premium to make sure both myself and my car get the best service. It clearly doesn’t look that way."
2020-11-17,1,"Do not purchase from this company and our use VW commercial financing. We have just come to the end of our 5-year leasing contract and are being completely fleeced. We were sold the whole story about Transporters holding their value and once the agreement has come to an end it will be worth more than is owed. So we have really looked after the vehicle, had it serviced by them and kept the mileage to a minimum. We paid the final balloon payment in March and took out a 1-year rental agreement to give us some more time to find a buyer. Just to be clear everything was paid off in full we owed nothing. We have now sold the vehicle privately for a good price. However, I am absolutely horrified to learn that VW finance invoices the customer directly. I am now being told that they will decide what the vehicle is worth and only repay us what THEY deem the market value to be NOT what I have sold the vehicle for. It's an absolute con. I can't believe you do this to businesses. Be warned read all the tiny small print because it's got a very nasty surprise."

Took the vehicle to Mercedes Brentford & passed the invoice on.Inchape stated they will not carry the work out as it’s too pricey & yet it’s from another approved dealership,everyone have a laugh one dealership ripping off another.Waiting for the vehicle to be collected & I have to contact them,They have called me twice & that is cause my complaint has gone to Head-Office.Will never ever buy from this dealership again,They have very bad customer service skills.

It’s completely put me off the Inchcape brand for life!"
2020-11-10,5,"Outstanding once again dealt with 2 great individuals Rosie Lee and Joshua Sutcliffe who assured me everything will be
Dealt with professionally and I had my car delivered fully working very happy 😃 with a 5 ⭐️ service as always well done 👍🏽"

2020-11-09,5,"The staff at Cooper Mini York are friendly and helpful, I we also take our BMW to Cooper BMW York where the staff are also friendly and extremely helpful, nothing is too much trouble, they make you feel like a valued customer at both sites."
2020-11-09,5,"I recently purchased a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid from Inchcape Guildford. I can't thank Sam Carter enough for looking after me. He had the patience of a saint and treated me with kindness and talked me through everything. There were little personal touches where it showed he listened to what I said. Even the congratulations sign had ""Jeff"" i had told him i had already named the car. I have bought my Yaris's from Guildford for over 10 years. Excellent service"
2020-11-06,5,How refreshing it is to be given great service having phoned several dealerships today Guildford Landrover are the only ones who dealt with our enquiry . Top marks for a great service and thanks for the videos as they really will help us to decide.
2020-11-06,5,"Recently bought an approved used vehicle, from the first phone call to visiting showroom, taking test drive and completing the deal we received professional, reliable, informative and friendly service. Simon our salesman was 5 star."
2020-11-05,1,"Inchape Mercedes Cheshire Oaks level of customer service is some of the worst I have every experienced. We have had fault after fault with our Smart Car. The second to last time it visited the garage the car came back to us filthy, covered in bird poo and tree sap, making me question as to whether the car had even been moved in the week they had had it. As way of an apology the next time it went in we were supposed to be given a full valet and a full tank of fuel - neither happened and no sorry or explanation as to why. Mercedes head office customer service is no better either, although they are free and easy with sorry's but no action is taken out! Fault still not fixed (banging sound). It seems you deal with a different member of staff each time as no one wants to take responsibility. Great sales team, aftercare SHOCKING!"
2020-11-05,1,"I never expected to be ignored or treated with such contempt by an approved Jaguar dealership.
Inchcape Jaguar Guildford will not respond to my various emails and will not answer my valid complaint regarding the repairs to my vehicle.
I suspect that I may get some ""hollow"" worthless response to this feedback but I will not hold my breath!"
2020-11-05,1,"Terrible service all round.

By far the worst Land Rover dealership in the whole country.

Avoid at all costs"
2020-11-04,1,"I bought an extended warranty with the car, been asking the sales person for the first 3 months for confirmation that one is in place.. a year later no confirmation, I've now received a leter from land rover saying I have 14 days the extend, called inchcape derby, which they told me they'll start an inchcape warranty, which I don't believe they've done, nor do I want an inchcape warranty. I should've been sold the extension of the warranty I have ""land rover"" or at least give me the option. I don't want the inconvenience of travelling to inchcape"
2020-11-04,5,We left the Bolton dealership after receiving terrible service and went upto Preston Land Rover where we were met by a salesman named Remi. Polite and professional from the word go. Remi resolved our problem with the in control app whilst going above and beyond with help and advice afterwards. I can’t speak highly enough of the care we received at Preston and will continue to use them for our serving and on going care. Bolton Land Rover need to take a large leaf out of their fellow dealerships books and up their game to come anywhere close to the quality of care delivered by surrounding dealerships going forwards.
2020-11-04,4,"Great experience purchasing our new Evoque thanks to Louise Ganley at Derby. Under the restrictive Covid conditions the experience was still something to remember with the attention to detail and effort made to make our purchase a special surprise for my wife. Thank you Inchcape Derby, Louise and her team."
2020-11-03,5,"Very good service as usual, Covid restrictions in place that worked smoothly that didn't cause any hinderince what so ever, so well done for that. Received videos of health check and oil change that was being carried out, no issues, and as usual received excellent service and clear to see services returned car cleaned and sanitised (due to COVID)ready for me to collect. Thank you Alan."
2020-11-02,5,"Visited Inchcape Chester to consider the purchase of a VW T-Cross. The used car sales executive there, Mr John Muldoon, was exceptionally helpful, advising us of the details of model and showing us the vehicles currently available in stock at the garage and other branches. He organised a test run for us the following day and later fully explained about purchase options and warranies, etc. When we decided to go ahead with a purchase he very quickly checked our own vehicle and made a fair offer for it in part exchange. I would say that he did not put pressure on us in any way and actually made the purchase a pleaseant experience. We would certainly recommend anyone to visit him at Inchcape Chester."
2020-11-01,1,"Cooper BMW (Sunderland). We were interested in buying a new x2. We went to the Sunderland branch and spoke to a sales advisor. We were looking to part x our car. The sales advisor done an appraisal and came back with a value of 16200. We nearly fell of our seat in shock as we been to another bmw, Ford, VW and Audi in comparison and all other dealers offered 17,500 to max 18250. Sales advisor said that’s what it’s only worth. The car we looked at was 33K with GFV 13900 and payments came in at 380 with 5K DEPOSIT. we compared this too a BMW X4 we got quoted price 36K same deposit 350 per month with GFV of 15K, we also compared it against a vw t roc price 35K same deposit 348 per month with GFV of 14500. 2 of the garages were down south and hadn’t even seen our car but still offered 18K. We buy any car for more offered 17k which is still a lot more than the value your branch offered. The sales advisor said I will call you later today as I will do a bit of work. Did he call no. We called in the next day and the sales advisor was off and it seemed nobody wanted to discuss it with us and was told we will get the sales advisor you spoke to to call you on the next day. As we were then leaving the business manager came out to see us and said I can look at the figures for you now (got told he was not in this weekend) so we sat down explained the offers we had and see what he could do. He came back and said 380 is my best price on that car and valued our car at 16200 and didn’t even entertain any negotiations that was his best price. He said I cannot give you more than what your car is worth to us as the system does not allow it. We asked about adding supa guard protection he said no best price take it or leave it. I said we buy any car is offering 17k for our car his response was sell it to them then. I said it’s Easter to part ex then selling through another company and we have been offered a lot more. We just felt he didn’t seem bothered about selling the car to us. He didn’t go beyond to get the business from us (all other garages did go beyond). Found overall service shocking and they rip you off with part ex your vehicle. DO NOT GO TO COOPER THEY RIP YOU OFF"
2020-11-01,1,"Traded in my previous BMW for a demonstrator 69 plate 4 series (6000 miles on the clock, £32,000). Collected the car and it broke down 5 miles from leaving the dealership - dashboard said 'too much oil in engine'. On slowly managing to get home, we then discovered lots of small scratches and scuff marks on the paintwork, now clearly visible in the bright late evening sun. I had purchased the extra paintwork insurance on the car, so would have expected it to be in great condition.
Returned the car to the dealership the following morning and it transpired that they still had engineers on furlough so the apprentices had worked on the car! Nobody obviously monitoring what they were doing! How can a main dealer overfill oil in a £32k vehicle? The head unit on the car then broke whilst they were trying to fix it and we were told that it needed to be totally replaced, from Germany. This took a long time to fix, plus the car then had to go back into the body shop, to put right the paintwork (where on attempted return of the vehicle to me, all they had actually done was polish the car, the scratches were still there - extra paintwork insurance is obviously a waste of money). I lost all confidence in the car, so told them I was pulling out of the purchase and wanted a full refund. Wasn't getting anywhere at all with them, constant delays & excuses and had to escalate to BMW UK, who said that the dealership would contact us within 2 working days - they took 5 days and all I got was an acceptance that they had totally messed up my purchase and preparation of the car, and a simple 'sorry for your very poor experience'. No offer of recompense for my extra incurred costs either! They returned my previous car to me on Friday night, with no paperwork; I now cannot tax the car or drive it on the road. Absolutely terrible customer service, they are very quick to take your money but are then totally incompetent with the service you receive thereafter. I am now 6 weeks on from the start, around £1200 out of pocket due to incurred costs (lost tax on both vehicles, insurance change costs & car depreciation etc), with a car returned to me that I cannot drive on the public roads. When transferring the funds back into my account, they even got that wrong as they had underpaid me; I had to chase them again to get this put right - Absolutely avoid this joke dealership like the plague! Alarm bells should have been ringing when I made the original purchase, as another customer was in there at the time having a real disagreement over a vehicle they had purchased."
2020-10-30,5,Really helpful staff.
2020-10-30,1,"Terrible customer service from day one.
Not kept up to date, had to chase them daily for updates. Tried to cancel and miraculously the issue resolved. Since having the car I've been waiting for a refund, still not been paid. Back to chasing them for updates. Can't wait to not have to deal with them again."
2020-10-28,5,Fantastic service by Sam in Sales
2020-10-26,5,"Every one we have spoken to or met at Mercedes-Benz of North Wales has been really professional, informative and friendly. They made us feel like valued customers."
2020-10-26,1,"Taken 3 weeks to email the invoice for a new car, failed to put company name on it and trying to blame me for their error...slow to answer phones, rude, miserable, inefficient."
2020-10-26,5,"Excellent service as always at Mercedes Benz of Cheshire Oaks.
Polite, competent, helpful and knowledgeable members of staff.
This is even more commendable considering the current restrictions due to the covid-19 pandemic."
2020-10-23,5,Front air bag warning notice. Second time the problem as occurred but now new part fitted to sort this out. All ok now.
2020-10-23,1,"Southampton Jaguar Inchcape
Three and a half year’s ago I had a rear parking sensor replaced at the Jaguar garage in Southampton. The cost for parts, diagnostic check and vat came up to £301. This week my car (the same) went into Jaguar Southampton for another rear sensor which had stopped working. The first price I received was for £750. The parts and diagnostic check all together were approximately £50 more than three and a half years ago so the labour charge had gone up by £400.I informed the garage that I had the receipt from my previous visit and I do not understand that the price has gone up by 150%. They then went away and called me back and offered me a new price of £650. I rejected this and asked them to look at my previous invoice which they did. After looking at my previous invoice they called me back and quoted £489. I was told that it would take one hour to remove the bumper, then one and a half hour’s to fit the sensor and another one hour to re fit the bumper. I was still not happy about paying this amount but told them to carry on with the work as I needed the car ."
2020-10-22,4,"Inchcape Basingstoke's Patrick was very helpful. Note, this is a genuine review, not ""invited review""!
We'd been looking for a new estate car for a while, after being let down by a number of other independent motor dealers (found via a well known car website) we settled on viewing a car at Inchcape Toyota. As it turned out the car was ideal. So we cancelled our other viewings with other motor dealers that day. They have a nice show room, easy to deal with. Plenty of staff."
2020-10-20,2,"The antenna repair was carried out, but the mechanic looking at the car did not check the spare tyre pressure sensor (as requested) because he apparently claimed a dog cage was in the boot. The cage is small, light, and empty. It is not fixed into the car and is easily lifted out of the boot. This strikes me a particularly lazy, and poor quality service."
2020-10-19,1,"I took my M4 CP to inchcape Chelmsford for a simple 2 year oil change, car has done 6700 miles. When I picked the car up and drove off I had a warning notification for low tyre pressures, checking the cars computer all 4 tyres were at 25psi! My tyres are always at 32/33 psi as they should be. How this has happened is beyond me! Why would the technician, Warren deflate my tyres? Coopers were happy to hand me back my 450 bhp car with a tyre pressure warning on the dash. Also when i got home I find that all my personal settings have been reset to factory! In essence I will never return to Coopers for any work or future purchase. I'm waiting for a manager to call me to explain why my car was handed back to me in a condition where a warning for all 4 tyre pressures were well below safe levels.
4 emails later and I've still not had the decency of a reply from anyone. A back street 2nd hand car dealership would have more courtesy."
2020-10-19,1,"Awful. This would be zero stars if it would let me.
Purchased a brand new car 13 months ago from Inchape Merc, Derby, constant issues. Rejected the car after 7 months. Now we are at month 13, I still have the car and am still fighting issues. It's back in every month for something. Inchcape constantly blame Merc, but Inchape just do not communicate with me. I can be chasing for a month at a time before I get an update as to what happens next to try and fix it. In the mean time I'm left with a vehicle which has a very broken computer control system. Auto braking self activates when it shouldn't, voice control does not work on all sort of internal issues, auto main beam comes and randomly blinds other drivers... the list goes on in terms of what I've had to have fixed. Now Inchape have taken to ignoring me. Guess they think I will go away..... not happening. Best part is I am not the only person I know with these issues on this MBUX system, a friend of mine purchased a Merc having liked the look of mine and is stuck with similar. Yet they refuse to acknowledge it. That is with the exception of the Sales Person who originally sold me the car and admitted in the car patk when I was last in he has also had issues.
I asked for a car swap or my money back in March, apparently neither of those are an option even though the Head Sales Manager agreed we could go down one of those roads.
Right now, I just want to return the vehicle for a refund of all money paid including deposits and insurances. I get the feeling they cannot fix it.
JSUT GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!!"
2020-10-17,1,"We purchased a car from my son, who bought a Mercedes Smart for 2 cabrio, from a London dealership, and we brought it back to Cheshire. We took on the Mercedes service plan, and when the time was right we phoned Inchcape at Warrington, for a service and two points of warranty required, the hood and the boot. The central reservation advised it would be about three weeks, before we could get it in, however, we advised that the warranty ran out in between, they confirmed that this would still be upheld as it was not our fault. We took the car in, and advised them the hood and boot had a problem, they said the service was covered but not the other two items, we were concerned as it was not the verbal contract entered, and we then had not time to book it into another dealer, so we contacted consumer trading who opened a case, and advised to let them know. When we got back to the dealership to collect it, we argued, and eventually they agreed not to charge for the warranty items. However on driving away the hood was still the same, we rang after the weekend, and it was booked in another ten days later, then it was advised that the hood clip was broken. They would have to order a part, and would ring us, when it got to six weeks and the vacuum from the lorries on the motorway physically lifted the hood, and put all the stress on the right clip, we rang and rang to request if the part was in. No one came back to us, we therefore wrote to the Manager a long letter, as they would not give us his email address, and he neither returned a letter or rang us, but eventually we were told on a further phone call the part was now in,when we requested when it came in the answer was they did not know, and we could bring it in. We again requested the manager to ring, to which he has never done, after some 9 weeks now,
today the part has been fitted, with no
apology, they are totally inefficient, and customer service is nil. We have other Mercedes , this was a fun car the smart, which has not been fun, and our other cars will definitely not be going back to this dealership as they are very poor, receive better from such as Halford, for all the money spent."
2020-10-16,1,Will never deal with this company again
2020-10-13,1,"If I could give zero stars I would.
We placed a £99 Refundable reserve on a car on August 3rd but decided not to buy. Since then, have contacted the Cheshire Oaks garage 8 times to query the refund. I have never been phoned back, despite requesting this. It is now 13th October and still no refund. Appalling customer service."
2020-10-12,5,Excellent service from first phone call to leaving the showroom.
2020-10-12,5,"Kim Joseph was super helpful, and found me exactly the car I wanted, thanks so much, will be a customer for life!"
2020-10-09,1,"Good sales management support, until I asked for my deposit back, on a car they couldn't fix to my satisfaction. After 2 weeks, and many calls, I've been told they have personally paid the deposit back onto my credit card. Why that couldn't have been done 2 weeks ago, I've no idea. Very disappointed, this happened from a reputable company, without an apology either."
2020-10-09,2,Generally the service when I am there getting car serviced is okay but recently really disappointed by 1) the length of time for courtesy car to be available has been becoming a pain for a while now. I think 6 weeks to wait is unreasonable. 2) I dont like the centralised booking I would prefer to speak with my local dealer and 3) I was re-booking my car in for a fault that was left from a previous repair which whilst a little frustrating with QA I could understand this but what I wasnt happy was being told I would have to pay a £90 diagnostic charge for the privilege to correct BMW's own mistake
2020-10-09,5,"I saw a car I liked on their website, the car was located at the Burton branch. I reserved said car & had conversations with the sales team who were very helpful & forthcoming. I arranged my viewing & test drive, they give you an hour which is plenty of time. Sam, the rep, who arranged my visit & processed the sale was very helpful. The service was excellent & I was more than happy with the deal."
2020-10-07,5,"Stopped by Inchcape Monday morning to have a look at there stock and found a Mercedes c class that I really liked. Spoke to Ben one of the sale reps and immediately he was so helpful and polite. Very quick service with the part exchange of my current car. After explaining that I needed to leave with the car the same day Ben did everything he could to get the paperwork sorted out almost immediately so I could drive away the same day.. I would recommend Inchcape to anyone, top blokes and very helpful"
2020-10-07,5,"Myself and my husband turned up one Sunday morning without and appointment as it was a last minute decision to view an Audi A1. We had been dealing with Malcolm via email the previous day.
Malcolm was great and appreciated how far we had travelled and explained their appointment system. Malcolm managed to work out an appointment for us to come back and see him half an half later which we were extremely grateful of. He ensured that before we left that he secured the vechile so that no one else was able to purchase this. He made sure that when we came back that he had all the details ready and then we worked out a deal for part exchange and we got what we were looking for.
Thought out Malcolm put us at ease was friendly professional and personable.
The following week we were on contact via email until we picked the car up the following Saturday. Malcolm wasnt in but had on advance arranged for Nathan to look after us. Again Nathan was great and really looked after us.
Overall I would definitely recommend a buying a car from here excellent service. Thank you Malcolm and Nathan"
2020-10-06,4,"Collecting my new car was an absolute pleasure, the service and care from Douglas was the same level of caring and consideration as the first time I purchased a car.
The negative to the experience had nothing to do with the staff but the availability of a decent wifi connection. If you expect a customer to sign up for MyT in an area where mobile signals don't exist then a good wifi experience is a must, with a good speed.
Douglas was embarrassed sitting there as I tried connecting to the wifi, and then seeing as the download continually failed. When the download finally completed the app would not login. Turning what should be a pleasurable experience to collect a new car into a frustrating one.
My profession is ICT and as the Head of ICT at a local hospice I would be mortified and embarrassed if I provided an experience like this.
I'd like to think in a world dependant on IT, and as a company you want customer to use it you will consider investing in your infrastructure and improve it."
2020-10-05,5,"Very helpful, polite guy picked car up and returned it. Car had been all cleaned out inside and outside was gleaming, as I hadn`t been able to get outside to see to it. Thanks to those who did collection/ return and valeted the vehicle, I was most grateful. All was seen to that needed doing, plus a split tyre I hadn`t noticed, cheers to all. I guess I will have to live with a Cooper S having a stiff gearbox, as seems a normal thing for BMW. In my opinion, no one can beat Ford boxes.. Still a nice little fun car for a couple in their 70`s"
2020-10-05,1,"Inchcape Used Car Centre - Burton
Just returned from a frustrating 30 mile/75 minute journey to test drive a 2019 Renault Zoe at 11.00am. I called yesterday morning and spoke to Alex about the car and asked if I could test drive it. There were no appointments on Sunday but someone would call back in 10 minutes to book one for Monday. After around 30 minutes Joe called and I booked for 11.00am today, but he knew nothing about the car so I would have to ask any questions of Rob (the EV expert) today. On arriving at the showroom for the test drive I was told that someone had put a £99 deposit on the car (subject to finance) and I could not have the test drive. If they failed the finance they could contact me!! At no point in these earlier conversations was I told that it would be worth paying £99 to reserve the car (which I would be happy to do) in case someone else jumped in first. I presume I could have even been on the test drive and this could have happened too. I was told they had called me earlier this morning to tell me, which they may have done, but no message was left on my mobile. This would have avoided the wasted journey but not the enormous disappointment. I will not be buying any vehicle from Inchcape but if other dealers have a deposit scheme to reserve a vehicle I will definitely be using it before I part with my £13k as a cash buyer (not needing finance!!)"
2020-10-03,5,"Great experience from start to finish. My initial online enquiry was responded to promptly with a polite and helpful call that provided additional and useful information. A few days later, after checking out the competition, I was able to place a refundable deposit to hold the car I wanted pending a visit to inspect and test drive. The Inchcape team were brilliant - polite, respectful, helpful but not pushy and the receptionists always ensured that someone got back to me if someone was engaged. After a test drive and my decision to purchase, the team continued to surpass expectations with respect to quality of service through to the day that I collected my car which had been beautifully prepared inside and out. I've purchased many cars over the years but this stands out as the best car-purchase experience so far. Well done and a massive thank you to Inchcape Swindon team from a very happy customer!"
2020-10-02,5,"Very friendly staff, willing to help with me with all aspects of my visit. Also helped to get phone setup properly with new car."
2020-10-01,5,Great customer service from ordering to collecting
2020-10-01,1,"Zero stars.... Now where shall I start... 22nd August 2020..telephoned and payed a £99 holding fee for a golf gti seeing as it would be over a 300 mile round trip to view and it go before we got there!! Well what can I say we were left rather deflated after expecting to see, albeit a second hand car, they pride themselves on every vehicle undergoing 142 point check.. Should have gone to specsavers comes to mind!! Within minutes of viewing the car, firstly it was not cleaned to the standard I expected from a vw dealer, there was excess wear on tyres a step on the discs and pads were low, on pointing this out to the salesman he agreed with us that things seemed a bit off and informed us that it would go into the service bay the following day and that he would get back to us with the findings... He then informed us that if what we picked up was put right the price of the car would increase... No phone call was recieved to update of findings, we assume they put them right as car was now listed at a higher price... Back to the start the £99 holding fee, wasn't automatically returned so I asked for it to be returned they told me 3-5 days for it to go back to account, it didn't arrive so I emailed to remind, to be told sorry its taking around 10 days they got it wrong, this was on the 17th of September, so 17 plus 10 is 27 when I went to school it was anyways. September 27th still no payment so emailed yet again and told that it would be by the 1st (13 is the new 10 I take it). Here we are 1st October 2020 where you can have shopping delivered to the door any ammendments credited to your account same day, food delivered within the hour and a dealership that prides itself on not only its customer service but its quality (142 point check). They fall short of the mark big time....."
2020-09-30,1,"Shame you can’t give zero stars because I would. Please think twice about leasing a car from this company. I have just taken delivery of a car and have to say the whole experience has been horrendous. Firstly the delivery driver followed no COVID guidelines - no social distancing and no face mask, secondly the driver made several extremely sexist comments which took me back to the 1970s and finally the car had several severe scratches down to the bare metal on multiple panels and I am meant to accept the car and they will just respray it during which time I am left without a car I am paying for. Even getting responses from the company has been hard work and on multiple occasions they have used threats to get me to accept the car. If you are thinking of leasing a car through them please, please, please think again. How companies like this continue to prosper I do not know."
2020-09-30,5,"Our old car broke down several times and having 3 disabled children makes our car an essential so we needed a new car ASAP. We saw a Golf at Inchcape Manchester. We spoke on the phone to sales rep Wayne and explained our urgency and we went to see the car at 3.30pm. Going off previous experience with car sales we thought we'd be there till closing time. But Wayne was fantastic did not drag out any schpiel, was not pushy at all.
We then sorted our finance out with finance manager Dan Bradbury, again very pleased with how quick and efficient he was and sorted us out. We were home by 5.30pm.
Our new car is being delivered to my husbands work in Salford today.
We are extremely happy and would recommend Inchcape Manchester and Wayne and Dan are an asset to the company"

2020-09-29,5,"Really pleased with the service & maintenance carried out on my 2 year old VW Sharan. I’m a Motability customer in Wrexham, and they kindly collected my vehicle from my home and returned it later the same day, all free of charge. Wrexham VW refused to do this under the current circumstances. Well done Inchcape, Chester. Excellent customer service."
2020-09-29,5,"Excellent experience taking my car for a service. Drop off & pick up were handled very well - professional & friendly manner. The safety precautions are spot on (one way system, lots of hand sanitiser & contactless handover) - very much appreciated in the current climate. My car was ready for collection within a few hours but the guys were very accommodating & kept it overnight for me because I wasn't able to go back same day."
2020-09-28,5,"I have enjoyed my new A class Sport Executive for a whole week now and I could not be happier!
My previous car was a Mercedes too. I wouldn't have anything else now.
Buying my car from Mercedes Benz Nottingham was a problem free experience. Phil was a star!
From first contact he was my personal shopping assistant.. no question or query was too much.
His responses were always within an hour if I couldn't speak with him immediately. He found the best car with the best deal he could. I can't thank him enough."
2020-09-25,1,"Absolutely disgusting the way I’ve been treated this week is something else. Only had my car for about 2 months and something is already wrong. They have told me they won’t take it in their garage at Cheltenham I have to take it to Swindon. I’ve been told it’s not safe to drive, the car has warranty and they seem to not want to help me at inchcape.I can’t get a straight answer and the staff have completely mugged me off! Ive spent so much money with them to just be ignored!"

2020-09-22,5,Well organised and efficient process in the current circumstances a pleasant experience
2020-09-22,1,"UPDATE: Reply to your message - I declined the free MOT because Dhan lied to me saying it already had a 12 month MOT so why should I come back to you at my expense to get something that should have been with the new car in the first place. To any new buyer of my old White RCZ advertised make sure you see all the receipts for all the work that has been carried out in the last 48 hours. Dealing with the dealership has not been the best experience.

Saw a car at Cooper Mini Cobham, arranged my own Mini finance so everything in place which was a complete surprise to Dhan. I part ex my RCZ for £3700 which is now being advertised for £6000+ (ps it needs ALOT of repairs - check the MOT advisories)

I was told by Dhan that my new car would have 12 months MOT but at the very last minute was told they did not do it and used it as a bargaining chip to reduce my part ex value.

Dhan was as helpful as he could have been in the restrictions of the dealership but Paul was rude and arrogant, didnt even say 'enjoy your new car' !

Be careful of this dealership."
2020-09-21,5,"very well treated ,nothing to much trouble"
2020-09-21,5,"I was met by Libby and thank you Libby, Libby's professionalism, care and understanding made my/our car buying experience a pleasure, she took the time we needed to digest the information at our own pace, worked with us to meet our requirements and now I'm a happy and proud owner of Polo GTI. There is a real sense of care and enthusiasm for Volkswagen at Inchcape Swindon a professional team and I will see you again for my daughters car."
2020-09-21,1,"I bought a V-Class Mercedes for my wife.

First experience - no one ever answers the phone. Annoying ! However, this was a lot less frustrating than actually visiting the garage (Warrington).

We were given an appointment at 11 am last Thursday to collect the vehicle by Lisa Brabin. We got to the garage on time and reported in at reception. At 11.30 am no one had come to see us so i reported back into reception. Lisa sheepishly came down to see us and made excuses that she had not been informed of our arrival. She then said that the car was ready and told us to wait outside. I left at this point as i needed to get back to work.

However ... a new twist in tale - my wife informs me that she cant collect the car on her own as mercedes had given us the wrong reg number so our insurance was invalid. i need to come back to the garage and sign another document to rectify their mistake.

When back at the garage i phoned into work and said i was going to be late. Lisa assured us the car was ready and asked us to wait outside. 15 minutes later it arrived !!!! However, it was dirty inside and out! By this point my wife and i were laughing because the situation was becoming comical.

Eventually we persuaded Lisa to arrange the car to be dropped at our house as we could no longer wait for it to be cleaned.

If the above isn't bad enough - my wife is 5 months pregnant - and really didn't need this.

Lisa was occasionally reinforced by her manager ""Ashley"" who to be fair did offer one apology - albeit an insincere one. Lisa never apologized once and just blamed others. However, Ashley was awkward and devoid of any leadership skills. Lisa was clearly sinking - he didn't really offer her any meaningful support.

Happy to talk this through with someone - terrible terrible terrible. My wife likes the car at least!"
2020-09-21,5,a routine service during covid made easier by the systems in place and the happy friendly staff
2020-09-20,2,"I enquired about the approved-used car as I saw it advertised on Autotrader. From the outset, the vehicle seemed to be everything that I was looking for, i.e. low mileage, only a year old, the specification I wanted and allegedly the condition that I was expecting for a car which was only a year old with very few miles on the clock. I requested a detailed video, along with pictures of the vehicle, highlighting any imperfections that it may have as I was not wanting to travel 3 hours to this dealership, to find out the vehicle was not as described. I did explain that I didn’t expect the vehicle to be as perfect as a brand new one as it had nearly 9000 miles on the clock, however I just wanted an honest representation of the car. I received this video and the images, and it seemed perfect. The interior was immaculate, and the exterior was described as the same, with no scuffs or scrapes to any of the body work or wheels. I then made an online payment as deposit for this vehicle and arranged to come and collect it the following weekend. I dealt with a guy named Gurvinder, I would usually call him a gentleman in such an instance like this, however there was nothing 'gentleman-like' about him. His customer service skills were nothing short of shocking. From dealing with him via telephone call, which was rare because whenever I called with a query, I would be told I would receive a call back, to which I never did. He was very arrogant and seemed to care more about himself and his own personal life, than he did selling me the car. Having learnt my partner is also in the motor vehicle trade, he spent more time discussing cars and money with him than he did discussing my queries with me as his customer. Even when out test driving the vehicle before I drove it away, he was talking more about himself rather than asking how I found the car and whether there was anything I wanted to know about it as it had a lot of features on the specification I was unfamiliar with. Prior to arriving, I was told nobody could show me the additional interior features the car had due to social-distancing and Covid-19. However, it soon became apparent that this was a lie as the salesperson sat in the front passenger seat whilst test-driving, with no PPE on either. This was the opportunity I could have been shown; however, I could not get a word in due to him talking about himself. When we arrived, we looked around the car in detail. Overall, the car was as described, however we came across a 2 inch scuff to the front bumper, which could not have gone missed. We questioned why this wasn't highlighted when I asked about the condition of the vehicle and any imperfections, to which the response was a shrug from Gurvinder and 'it's a used car, what do you expect'. If I hadn't had drove 300 miles to the dealership that morning, I would have walked away requesting my deposit back as I was utterly appalled at this response. Early that week I sold my car which was triple the age of this car, with triple the mileage and it had not one mark on it (bar a few stone chips which are to be expected). So, as a matter of fact, no I shouldn't have expected a car which is a year old and under-miled to have a scuff to the front bumper. I asked if this could be sorted before I drove it away, which it couldn't, so we negotiated for the repair to be sorted when I got back home, and they would reimburse me for the cost. I was told I could not spend more than £100 on the smart repair, however after received quotes from several reputable companies, none of them would touch it for less than £150 due to the work that needed to be done and also because the car was still under manufacturer’s warranty. I explained all of this to the sales manager and how I wanted it repairing it to the same standard as that of what a Mercedes dealership would, and he agreed to get the repair done for the £150 and he would reimburse me accordingly. I struggled to understand how this had been missed due to it being valeted fully before it being handed over to me; however, I soon realised the valet was not thorough due to the interior being filthy. The glove compartment and centre console were full of crumbs and dust. There were sticky marks on the trackpad, again not Covid-19 hygienic at all. But I was so deflated at the whole experience of collecting my new car that I just wanted to get back home and I would pay for it valeted properly myself. So, to cut a longwinded and terrible experience short, I would not recommend purchasing a car from Mercedes-Benz Stratford-upon-Avon, unless you want to deal with an egotistical salesperson who talks out of his backside."
2020-09-19,5,easy to book service and mot. Kept well informed. Friendly service.
2020-09-18,1,"BMW Cooper Sunderland Branch

Their customer service and communication skills are shocking.

I had contacted the branch several times about a particular car which was advertised twice within a few weeks.

The first time I phoned and was told the car was under negotiation but the salesman would call me back the next day to let me know if it was available or not. He did not. I phoned the following day to ask if it was still available, I was abruptly told it was sold and the phone was slammed down on me.



I noticed a few weeks later the car had gone back on the website. Despite the poor service I'd recieved previously I was still interested in the car, so I dropped by the branch on Sunday 30/08. I was told nobody was available and I should phone on Tuesday 01/09 early morning to arrange an appointment.

I phoned at 9am and explained I wanted to arrange a viewing that day as it was my day off work and wouldn't be available till the weekend otherwise. I was told everyone was again busy and I'd recieve a call back. I did not. So I phoned at 11am, simply to be told they were busy and I'd get a call back, no further explanation or apology. I waited till 4.30pm and hadn't recieved a call back.
The customer service is terrible, communication skills are unacceptable and it would appear they aren't interested in making a sale.

I phoned a third time to complain, I was told it was the first day of the new registration plate which is why they were particularly busy. I hadn't been told this previously, if I had been I would have understood. Even so I don't think it's unreasonable to spend 5 minutes between appointments to arrange a viewing which could lead to a sale for your company. I was then immediately put through to someone who arranged a viewing for today. At no point did I recieve an apology.



I had been told I'd be contacted to confirm the appointment, I wasn't so I checked the website to see if the car was still available. It was but the price had increased by near to £500. I arrived at the appointment, I was told the salesman was off sick so another salesman came to speak to me. I asked about the price increase and he said it was because the car had so many extras on it. Which I know does not make a difference to a cars value. For used cars extras only help to sell a car they do not increase the value, only the model, mileage and condition does. I asked if they'd reduce the value to its original advertised price as I didn't feel it was worth what they were now asking and he refused, didn't even try to negotiate. So I left, disappointed.

I feel the original price should have been honoured as they raised the price after I expressed interested and booked an appointment.



The service I have recieved from this branch is not what I'd expect from BMW, their communication skills in particular are totally unacceptable. I should not have to chase someone to sell me a car.

My complaint has been sent to BMW UK"
2020-09-16,5,"Just called with my son to pick up his new Mercedes GLA200d Sport. First time we had met the Sales executive Phillip Litchfield who had dealt with the sale by phone with us over the last week.
His professionalism along with his friendliness is a quality Mercedes a Nottingham needs to be proud of.
I rang Nottingham after I felt another dealership we had been in touch with was not helpful and very slow at getting back to us to answer our questions.
It meant we had further to travel to collect the car today but my advice is...... if you want a a Mercedes go to The Nottingham branch and ask for Phillip Litchfield, we will definitely be contacting him again for our next car."
2020-09-16,4,I had a recall the car went in done within the hour excellent service
2020-09-16,1,"Had a reply from Inchcape who are sorry that I am not 100% satisfied - I'm actually 0% satisfied

Really bad. cancelled my booking at 19:15 the night before. Didn't look at the car but were happy to say it was wear and tear and not warranty without seeing the car!
Now switched to Marshalls who were really helpful."
2020-09-14,2,The receptionist not very friendly at all you don't see them smiling they look very grumpy it would be nice if they had a smile on their face this is the Leicester branch
2020-09-14,5,"Fantastic service, really friendly staff."
2020-09-14,5,Nick the sales executive at Jaguar Southampton was very friendly helpful and knowledgeable and kind on the day he made sure everything was okay and we were happy and sorted out a few hiccups and even price matched another dealer that we were going to go to yes I would recommend Inchcape
2020-09-14,5,I have always had an excellent experience when I’ve visited mini which is why I always return to them. Their customer service is superb and despite the current Covid situation they booked me in for a service quickly and had the work completed in a morning. The service the technicians supply is wonderful and I have never had any problems with any of the work they have done. I would highly recommend them and have always had a reliable and wonderful service from them at all levels.
2020-09-11,1,"Awful dealership. The staff are very pleasant to speak to, but in practice they are inefficient and their remote communication is dreadful, creating high levels of frustration when they don't reply to the phone, or to texts or emails. My car went in for service this week. They left a message on my phone to change the time when they wanted me to take it in, meaning I had to change my work plans on the spot. Could I get a response from them when I texted back, and then called?! Courtesy car had evidence of sticky sweets and wrappers, and was also dirty internally. Could not be confident that any Covid19 sanitisation had taken place. The warning light was also on for the tyre pressures. All were very low, and one tyre was only 2/3 inflated. Used the toilet whilst I was there. No soap. Hand dryer was switched off due to Covid, and a notice advised to use the hand towels. There weren't any. This is JAGUAR for goodness sake, but it is all highly typical of my experience with this dealership over the last few years, and I most definitely won't be returning when it is time to change my car."
2020-09-09,1,"Purchased Evoque from inchscape York, returned for service. Said the service had been carried our fully. Paid £370 to discover the service had NOT been fully carried out. Do not take your car here. Lied refused to refund my money, offered to redo the service free of charge yet I had already paid £370!. Disgusted and very disappointed!
Why on earth would I trust Inchscape to actually carry out the service I had already paid for. Would you?"
2020-09-09,3,"Car service and courtesy car.
My car had been booked in for a service, also I had pre booked a courtesy car.
On the day before the service was due, I contacted the dealership to get courtesy car details, to add to my own insurance for the day.
I was informed the cars were in the process of being allocated and someone would call me back, with the details.
No call back was received.
On my arrival at the dealership, I was informed there was no car available for me, due to over runs and the sales department using more cars due to new registrations. My comment was that this should not be made my problem, and informed the advisor of my call the previous day for courtesy car details and lack of a call back. A call would have been appreciated to enable me to organise my transport accordingly. My option was to rebook to include a courtesy car - but nothing available until end of September. Which to me was unacceptable
I had no other means of transport, as I was expecting a courtesy car, I asked for the service to be carried out while waiting. This was eventually agreed by the Workshop/Service Manager and handed the car over.
The car service/inspection was carried out and car washed, which took about 2 hours"
2020-09-08,1,"After my last review regarding poor service from volkswagen inchcape cheltenham, I had a reply asking me to email tellusmore. I have sent them 2 emails regarding my problem and have received no reply! This company is a joke! AVOID AT ALL COST"
2020-09-08,5,"On the 8th of August I took my Tiguan to have app connect installed.
I returned home delighted and parked up.
The next time I used the car the screen begin to behave strangely with the map screen jumping around and the screen registering random selections.
I carried out a factory reset and the problem improved for a short time.
The problem returned and intensified, so I contacted the dealer.
Yesterday I took the car and left it from 9:15 to 3pm where it was looked at and a software update was attempted to no avail.
Faced with the prospect of paying for a new infotainment system I was concerned to say the least.
Luckily for me, service manager Chris got on my side and negotiated with my warranty company to get a replacement unit.
It's highly likely that I will be returning to the Inchcape group.
I have been well looked after."
2020-09-03,1,"Just had a bazaar experience with this dealership, taken a 2 hour drive to get there for a previously booked test drive. on arrival we waited a short time to see the salesperson, who then took my driving licence I presume to photo copy it. Waited about 10 minutes for the return of my licence, he then disappeared again and after a short time returned with the trade plates. We proceeded with the test drive, on our return I did show a keen interest in the car, went back to the same lounge area thinking we may come to some kind of deal. By this time I think he realised I did not need the finance, he the disappeared numerous times before returning asking about the service record on my car, saying they had no record on their system. I told him it has a full service record with Halfords, but not with Mercedes, all the records were in the car, off he went again going in and out of different doors, before coming back with a ridiculous p/x offer saying we can’t put your car on the forecourt because it has not been serviced by us it would have to go to auction. I was a bit taken aback by this considering my car is only 3 years old and in excellent condition, I feel that the comments about the servicing were just an excuse because I didn’t need the finance. I was actually made to feel like a criminal trying to offload a dodgy vehicle, my only conclusion is if your not looking to finance a car stay well away from this dealership. This took place on the 01/09/2020, I looked today 03/09 on their website the car I was interested in is there again with an increase in the price?"
2020-09-03,1,"Have been told by Mercedes inchcape that I have to buy 2 new amg 20inch wheels as they have cracked. I am really disappointed as I bought 2 new wheels in March 2020 and now being told I have to buy 2 more.

The car is 1 year old. Inchcape told me to put a complaint in to head office as this is not normal all 4 amg wheels replaced in 1 year.

I put a complaint in and Mercedes complaints team were not interested and state this is not covered under warranty. Despite there being lots of complaints about amg wheels cracking in a short period of time

All I want is wheels that are fit for its purpose. It's not normal for all 4 wheels being cracked in 1 year.

Mercedes needs to accept they are putting amg wheels on cars that are not fit for its purpose"
2020-09-02,3,"Our VW Golf GTD had a minor Warranty fault back in February, went into VW Swindon (Inchcape) and was stuck there for nearly 3 months during Covid.
Whilst this should have been avoidable (it only needed a new battery), our biggest grievance has been the absolute failure to respond to any of our requests for an explanation.
Emails, Phone Calls, Letters - all unanswered.
The day I was eventually able to collect the car, I asked to speak with someone about it - and was told they weren't available but promised they would definitely contact me - never did.
Wrote to VW UK. They apologised and said that VW Swindon would be in touch - never heard a thing.
As a customer, it is rude and makes you feel worthless.
They are a big company, process a lot of cars, and based on my experience, the Customer Care Department really don't care.
They had 10 opportunities to deal with this but never did.
It has damaged not only our impression of VW Swindon, but also tarnished VW, which is a great shame.
Fortunately Trustpilot gives unhappy customers the opportunity to be heard and warn others.

UPDATE
I've now seen Inchcape's response below.
Very 'generic' and still no offer to assist with our grievance.
If Inchcape VW really are serious about 'customer care', who is the specific individual we should contact ?
UPDATE 2
Thanks to David Clements, the Service Manager, my confidence has been partially restored - so I have uplifted my review from 1 Star to 3 Stars.
Much better effort, after the earier debacle."
2020-09-01,1,Waste of time as was told the juddering in reverse is ‘normal’ on e-pace and their way of wrongly adjusting wing mirror in reverse was to switch feature off. Didn’t get an update on day or told car ready I just turned up at closing time.
2020-09-01,5,Commendable and efficient service with respect to the fitting of the front and rear dashboard Cameras.
2020-09-01,2,"Considering the price of the annual service, the car was poorly cleaned and valeted (boot hadn't been touched). This really isn't consistent with that of a premium dealership, marque and price. Big lack of communication between Southport and Liverpool dealerships in terms of vehicle sale/service, age and car features, considering it's the same group. Confusion over MercedesMe which still hasn't been resolved."
2020-09-01,5,"The lad I dealt with Jake, provided a brilliant service from the start. Very knowledgeable, sorted me out with the best deal and I had the car within a week. Absolutely no faults and would recommend to anyone."
2020-08-31,5,"I would rate minus if this was based on the treatment I receive from Paul Antrobus, but thanks to Calum and Brandon I rate 5 stars. They both went out of their way to help me and rectify Mercedes mistake that could have caused a fatality on the motorway. Paul’s attitude was dismissive, rude and absolutely disgusting. Thank you so much to Calum and Brendon myself and my family look forward to many more years of cars from Mercedes Warrington"
2020-08-31,3,I asked 2 questions about the car we purchased and the salesman answered positively. The answers given were wrong as we found out after we bought the car. When questioning the salesman about this he kind of joked it off. Also after spending on a new car I thought we would be shown round the car. Nope. Also not even an air freshener was included. Poor. This nothing to do with Covid. Just poor salesmanship.
2020-08-31,5,Very helpful staff in a safe environment with a good choice of cars to choose from. All the staff were very helpful and knowledgeable which made the whole experience very easy
2020-08-27,5,"Once again I can't fault the service that I received from Inchcale Ford, Farnborough. In particular, Martyn Laird, who always manages to find me the best cars and makes the process of purchasing a new car, so easy and hassle free."
2020-08-27,2,Disappointed that my car went in for an update to the car play software. I was told it had been updated and was all ok. Picked up my car and told someone would contact me to check all was ok. I did not receive a call and the car is exactly the same as it was when it went in - not solved.
2020-08-26,1,"Minus 10 really but have to give 1 star to get a review. DO NOT BUY FROM INCHCAPE, bought a £18k Evoque from Burton On Trent which has so far cost £1400 to make safe and been offered £300 compensation, extended warranty I purchased invalid because they had not completed the correct timing belt change prior to handing over the vehicle. Reviews are asked whilst they complete the purchase whilst inside the showroom so positive reviews are high (how do you feel when buying a car at the time?) GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I am taking legal action and feel very stressed that this is the way a large company deals with customers. Vehicle purchased March faults reported on my way home now end of august. BE AWARE."
2020-08-24,1,"My wife has always used Inchscape Swindon VW to purchase her cars over the last 25 years and last June took delivery of a new Polo. She only drives the car locally so does not clock up a large mileage but we noticed that the windscreen wipers were making a scraping noise whenever we had rain or used the washers. I contacted Inchscape Swindon and asked if the windscreen had any wax on it from delivery as we were getting this noise and was told perhaps if I washed the screen with washing up liquid it may clear the problem. I did so but as we had not used the car for a while noticed that when we did use it again the wipers were no better. In January of 2020 my wife contacted Inchscape once again only to be told to leave it till the car came in for its first service. Little did we realise that Covid would approach and whenever we rang to book a service found the garage was closed. Eventually on 15 June the car had its first service after 3 months of lockdown - the car had not been driven prior to this service due to shielding. We were told when collecting the car that the wipers were fine but as soon as we got into the car and used the washer and put the wipers on the noise was still there. At no time prior to or after the service were we told that the wipers were not under warranty nor did the garage indicate to us at any time when we mentioned the wipers to them that they were not under warranty. We came home and rang the garage once again to ask if the wipers could be looked at. The car was booked in for today 24 August. My wife arrived and explained the situation to Service Reception - she was told that new wipers could be fitted for £45 - that as the car had been on the road for over a year the wipers were general wear and tear and could not be replaced without charge. My wife asked why she had been led to believe over the last few months that the matter could be resolved by returning the vehicle to inchscape to look at them and on each occasion had never been told that they were not under warranty - the car has just over 3000 miles on the clock since new - we buy new cars every 2 years and have never ever had wipers that needed replacing nor made the noise that the present ones make. When I entered the premises I found my wife having to keep explaining the situation that she has found herelf in only to be told by the service receptionist that nothing could be done. She offered my wife a discount for new wipers and I told my wife not to pay a penny for them. I became rather annoyed at their stance on the matter and the woman gave the impression that we were lying about the whole thing as if we had driven the car for over a year and then said that the wipers were making a noise. I told her that she was an utter disgrace and if this is what Inchscape call ""Customer Service"", that this would be the last car we would be buying from them. I was told that I was being aggressive and the woman refused to deal with either me or my wife. I left and sat in my car and my wife asked to see the Servicing Manager. She explained to him yet again how long it had taken to get the matter resolved only to find now they would do nothing. He told her that the wipers are not under any warranty and that they harden in icy weather - ""what icy weather she asked"" - she explained that not one VW car she had owned had never had problems with the wipers and that several had gone through very icy weather with no problem. Her comments fell on deaf ears - they just didn't want to know. Having purchased 3 Polo's, 4 Golf,s and a Scirroco from this garage we will never ever go back there to purchase anything form them. They just don't care. What infuriates me even more is the fact that the previous communications we had had with them about the wipers was totally ignored and they were unwilling to accept that this vehicle just had a poor set of wipers on it and needed replacing. If I'd had the opportunity I would not have given 1* to Inchscape Swindon as they just do not listen and are totally intransigent."
2020-08-24,5,"I arrived at the scheduled time and was seen by the service representative without delay.

The safety recall work was carried out within the timescale I had been notified of in advance.

It felt like appropriate arrangements were in place to enable customers to keep safe."
2020-08-24,2,"Bad call centre - wrong information given, doesn’t know what the GDPR act is, and still waiting on one call back from 4 weeks ago and a manager call back from 5 days ago. Not very impressed.
2 stars because I got a curtesy valet, the car was brought to the door because it was raining, and covid safety."
2020-08-24,5,"Great team, always professional and courtious to deal with as well as being super competitive. Would recommend without doubt."
2020-08-22,1,"If you’re buying a luxury car with a hefty price tag, you expect good customer service. I purchased my Range Rover sport & whilst I love my car, I have not loved the customer service I have had, numerous issues & they never get it right unless you escalate it to a manager. I’d rather just have good customer service to start with. I understand mechanical things go wrong and have been patient and understanding when they have but there is no excuse for poor customer service and being lied to."
2020-08-22,4,"Hi, I have just bought a 2014 Mini Cooper hatchback.

Top team!!"
2020-08-21,5,"I recently had my car serviced on the 17/08/2020. The staff were friendly and helpful. I received a video of my car having a health check which was useful and reassuring to know only necessary work has been carried out.
I can honestly say Toyota have managed to run the service smoothly and effectively during the Covid pandemic"
2020-08-21,5,"A Great experience throughout, James was very professional and an ambassador for the Mercedes brand, very knowledgable with respect to MB products and services and was able to support every request we had during the buying process. Our first Mercedes purchase, it certainly will not be our last, we are delighted with our new car."
2020-08-19,1,Very poor communication. Very long waits to talk to service. Charging for courtesy cars. These are the norm in my experience. This time car went in at 9:45 am for a service and when I phoned At 4:30pm as I didn’t have the promised update It hadn’t even gone into the workshop!
2020-08-18,1,"The receptionist that grudgingly greeted me upon arrival was EXTREMELY rude! to the point where I asked to speak to a manager and asked for her name, which she flatly refused to give me. she then sent a colleague over to ""deal with me"" the colleage was a lot more polite and informed me that the rude woman was called Paige, and that she would send a manager over to take details of my complaint and that went ok. I then sat and waited for my MOT to be completed (I am a wheelchair user and due to a lack of drop kerbs I can't get off the lot without my car), while witing for 3 and a half hours for my car to be returned I witnessed a memer of the sales team actively telling customers, that had come in wearing masks as per the government rules for retail premises, to remove their masks while inside the dealership apparently because ""they were uncomfortable and not really needed"" (her words not mine). I also witnessed several customers coming into the dealership without masks and at no point were they asked to put them on despite the rules being very clearly advertised at the front door. As someone who spent the best part of 5 months shielding during the height of the pandemic due to underlying medical conditions I found it absolutely appalling that the staff at Inchcape were treating the health & safety of your customers, and your staff with so little respect.

I am coming to the end of my motability lease and despite no one at Inchcape appearing to be that interested in securing my future business I had planned to try and talk to someone one last time to see if anyone would be prepared to talk to me about a new motability vehicle.However seeing how uninterested the sales staff seemed and how unsafe I felt while in the dealership i decided not to bother and have now placed an order for a new vehicle with the Nissan Dealership over the road from Inchcape because when I went there the staff were only too happy to help and they were following ALL the Covid-19 safety rules allowing me to feel safe and valued as a prospective customer. I will never return to Volkswagen after my recent experiences with Inchcape."
2020-08-18,5,"Following my very public rant about Inchape Jaguar in Southampton ( a few weeks ago on Google and LinkedIn) I would like to pass on my greatest thanks to Gary Pont. Gary you are amazing! Not only did you manage to sort out what we were told was impossible a week ago, but you have not spared anything to provide us with a serious A* VIP service!!!
We went from being treated extremely poorly to being looked after like royalty. It was absolutely refreshing to be dealing with a real person, and not the usual “professional” robot who seems to lack complete empathy and problem solving skills. We very much look forward to be dealing with you in the future. Your qualities are very rare, especially in the automobile industry. We wish you the very best in your new post. We have no doubt you will turn this place around!!!

Please watch the video to see the service we got offered today (LinkedIn only)! (Picked up car at 9.00 am, got car fixed, sent us a summary video and dropped off car at 1.30 pm)."
2020-08-18,1,"Don't even deserve one star
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP AND DO NOT BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.
Inchcape Mini BMW sold me a faulty car and lied on the vehicles condition and lied about warranty cover both of which I was very specific about before purchase.
I immediately reported the car as faulty to which Inchcape denied.
Three independent reports (I paid for) noted major repairs costing thousands mainly with the transmission and this was a very low mileage car. Very difficult to get anything dealt with this company, if you get hold of them that is, you get brushed off or passed about. They had no trouble taking the car back from me that i rejected after report 3 but it's now been weeks and they still have over 13k of my money and the car and surprisingly difficult to get in touch with to get my money back.
This company tells you everything you want to hear to make the sale, after purchase the company is as good as non existent.
Warranty ties you up using inchcape's repair centres to comply with the warranty policy, only to be left paying extortionate prices as it was not covered under warranty.
Terrible communication. A very unprofessional company.
I am looking into taking legal action to get my money back and taking to as much media as i can"
2020-08-17,1,"This company takes cars in for repairs and damages them, they refuse to answer your questions. The excuses they give are so weak and feeble they refuse to answer when you explain that it just woke happen. They refuse to put anything in writing and as for final response letters which is a legal requirement this company thinks its above that.

So many questions that have been unanswered so many questions they refuse to give and even when you ask over and over to be treated correctly they shut up shop.

Breaching my terms and conditions at the minute and refusing to fix damage caused by them even though everything points to them.
This company is a joke for treating ita customers fairly id avoid it like crazy.



in response to your message
it is not possible to get in touch with them until you actually give your answers in writing so you cant change them and also actually give a final response letter. both you have refused to do. in fact all that comes out of inchcape is things that are impossible to do .
im still waiting for my final response letter AND the questions answering . discussed with general manager isnt a answer when im telling you they havent been discussed. if you think that many questions can be answered in 3 minutes is impossible

Update :
A collison report notice was sent to me while the car was in your company's possession. And after several emails and conversations with your garage and your head office you completely refuse to tell me what happened. The facts the car came back damaged and you offer no reasons to why is absolutely disgraceful.
This company provided NOTHING to say what happened so beware."

2020-08-16,1,"Customer service is worse than ZERO! Following numerous phone calls regarding buying a new Jaguar XE and trading my 1 year old E Pace. The salesman Matt left me a voicemail on Friday at 17:20. I returned the call at 17:24 and left a message with one of his colleagues to let him know I would call in over the weekend and asked for a call back which never happened. I then drove from 66 miles from Brough to York on Sunday as the salesman Matt had asked to see my car to give a trade in value before we could proceed. When I got there he was just rude and said he didn’t have time to see me I explained that I had made a special journey there, he said he still didn’t have time for me then turned his back on me and walked away. I guess customers are just an inconvenience and Inchape Jaguar actually don’t want to sell cars!"
2020-08-15,1,"Enquired about a used car. Had to wait a week for a test drive due to work being required. First attempt at test drive failed because car was still in the workshop. Only told after 60 mile round trip. Successful second attempt the following day, only to be told after the test drive that the price had increased by £700 due to the work that was required. Unsurprisingly we walked away!"
2020-08-14,1,"I was always told good things about the customer service quality, appears that was a lie. I went to your site in Leicester to view your AMG line cars, C43, A45 and C63. I first had to ring the dealership as they had made 0 contact after my initial enquiry 4 days earlier. I arrived at the dealership and was told on the phone I was able to test drive and view the car, only to then be told I’m under 25 so can’t test drive your AMG line cars?? Is this because you think Under 25s can’t afford them? What sort of crack policy is that? I went to the BMW garage ran by Sytner immediately after and was given a full ability to drive their cars and ended up purchasing an M3 competition. For a “premium” brand with “premium” service, it was a damn shame that you lost business due to your outdated policy."

2020-08-10,1,Car collected and then 2 hours later told all done all ok - payment. Car returned and then I checked paperwork and x by control panel update. So I called told will get to me - no one did 6 hours later so I called back. Told yeah not done on hold by Range Rover so couldn’t do. I asked why not sure. So when will it get done ? When next in. I didn’t like the way I was 1 not told before car came back and had to find out myself 2 just brushed off by service to get off phone. I even told them before brought in issues with sat nav - she told me well this won’t help or effect that ? So did u check No. I am not happy With the lack of care or support.
2020-08-08,1,"Toyota Auris Hybrid

A year ago my Toyota Hybrid Auris developed a blister on the car due to not being able to handle hot weather in the summer. Sounds unbelievable, but It’s true! It was a very abnormal and shocking fault from the paintwork. I tried everything I could with Toyota, initially they told me it’s a fault of the paint work and they will repair it and I was still within the 10 year warranty but then Toyota refused to repair my car. I didn’t give up, I even took it to the HQ, but in the end they fobbed me off saying they only repair perforations from within the car and not outer. Basically any excuse to make me pay for it instead despite being an international car company. I found this extremely unprofessional, disheartening, disgusting and was appalled at their service. I ended up getting depressed for months, it really had a huge effect on me mentally.

A year later, lastnight a catalytic converter was stolen from my car and before this I had no idea what that was. I then learnt that my car was one of the ones being targeted by thieves since last year and the crime rate for theft of these has gone up greatly. I’m very angry that Toyota did not bother sending a warning letter to their customers and make them aware. Apparently I have learnt you can purchase a Catloc which protects the catalytic converter and helps protect it. Why wasn’t I informed of this before? I’m furious because these cost a fortune to replace now, who is responsible?

2020-08-07,1,"Absolutely disgrace of customer service. False promises from staff including managers. Still awaiting refund for a car that miraculously disappeared for 5 days now. Still awaiting refund to buy elsewhere. How can a company keep your full
Payment for so long and not come up with the goods ?
Staff lie continually and fail to return calls. After 5 days I still have no car and am awaiting a 15k refund !!!
Go elsewhere for your car sales !!!


Further to the comment below from Inchcape Nottingham. I have only received the refund today Monday. This was over a week since I actually paid for the car. The money was promised to me Thursday after an incorrect sort code. It was guaranteed into my bank Friday morning - guess what no money. Then guaranteed Monday morning - guess what no money. I actually had to open a fraud reference with the debit card company and eventually it arrived. Inchcape had advised this was because my bank were refusing the money. After speaking to my bank considerably in detail they had never refused the amount. It was negligence with Inchcape toyota. The company are full or false promises from beginning to end !!!"
2020-08-07,5,"Land Rover Discovery Sport SE Tech (7 seat)

I had the pleasure of being looked after by Mike Rawnsley at Inchcape JLR Derby.

Mike was very welcoming and accommodating from the very first telephone conversation we had.

I was sent a personalised walk around video from Mike, this started the great experience we had of buying our car from JLR Derby.

Mike has an impeccable attention to detail and was keen to ensure our best interests were catered for when buying our car. His knowledge of what you actually need is very credible - he is there to make sure the car is right for you.

There is a few extra’s I would recommend having from JLR - paint guard (good if you have kids) and the additional extended warranty (peace of mind).

5 stars from me - thanks for a great experience!

2020-08-06,5,Excellent throughout.
2020-08-05,1,"Unfortunately I cannot give this company less than 1 star. Shocking customer service, I paid £25k for a 12 month old Mercedes from the Llandudno dealership, Once i declined to buy their ridiculous priced products like GardX and Alloy wheel cover I felt i was not regarded a valuable customer anymore, i found it difficult to get an answer on the phone, nobody replied to messages left, the car was delivered dirty and we hand no handover or explanation of what the cars functions were, nor were we offered any demonstration of the car prior to buying it. To top it all off the dealer never paid the finance off on our part exchange leaving us to do all the chasing and risk not ending up with a bad credit history. We were offered £100 to spend in their overpriced sales shop as way of an apology. I declined this as it was a total insult. Buyer beware, shop elsewhere."
2020-08-04,5,"Recently had the pleasure of using Inchcape Mercedes, brillinat experience. Most of the sale was conducted over the phone and on email and had great health and safety practices when I did pop in to store."
2020-08-04,5,Terrific service by Landrover and the car came back in brand new condition.
2020-08-03,5,"Absolutely first class service. Upon my arrival I was greeted by a handsome engineer named Lee. Apparently only my brakes were booked in but I needed a service too. Lee was happy to include this.
After the service my car has never ran so well. Its fair to say this is the best experience I have ever had with any dealership. Lee is a credit to Mercedes Benz."

Getting back to Merc Warrington in general they are good replaced 4 alloys near end of 3 year warranty, coffee exc, communication not so good at times"
2020-08-01,1,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Terrible customer service!
Visited Inchape in Swindon to test drive a car, the car was being falsely advertised, the pictures were old and the owners were incorrect. They had no service book and no booklets for the car but originally told me that they did. The sales assistant Micky was absolutely useless. The car needed some work but this was never done. A week after buying the car they had given me no update on the progress, on asking they had no answers, the car clearly had seriously issues that they were not willing to share with me. I eventually walked away from the car but it took 9 working days for my deposit to be refunded despite chasing on various occasions. Nobody cares about customer service here, once a sale was made they had no interest. Shocking service from such a reputable brand. Will not be looking to use this main dealer again."
2020-07-31,1,"I turned up to get my car serviced, now it wasn't the lady at Mercedes fault. However when we signed the PCP for the car we were told all servicing was included etc. When I phoned and booked the service I said it was on a plan it was only on arriving at Mercedes that I was told the two services had been used and I needed to pay for this one. As it was due and I was there with small child I thought I better just get it done. My car has done very little mileage and we had been shielding this year so hardly done any miles so far. I now going though my emails find that I could have waited 180days past the due date and this would still be valid. Hmmm funny how no one mentioned that!! Also when I arrived on handing my keys over my spare key was dead. They said they would put a battery in it - it doesn't work. So they didn't have tried phoning can't get through. My overall experience is that you really don't care about your customers just getting their money. I thought before that Mercedes in my mind were a good brand. I can say my overall experience is poor. It was even admitted that it was your fault that the PCP was set up wrong. If I have a car on finance it's so I don't have unexpected bills. However I just feel your communication to your customers is poor. Someone could have phoned me before the day and said it's no longer included. And now I have just read the 180days thing!!! I knew MOT's were extended- maybe I should have read my emails better but I had bigger things to worry about as did most of us. Overall just disappointed."
2020-07-31,5,Fantastic experience buying my new car with Phil Litchfield. Nothing was too much trouble. Phil took the time to understand my needs and went the extra mile at every step of the way meeting my grumpy expectations and demands with humour and a smile. I would t hesitate to recommend Phil to any friends or colleagues which is high praise for me indeed as someone notoriously hard to please. Thanks so much Phil for your help in getting my shiny new Mercedes on my driveway in super quick time. It’s been a pleasure. I hope we do more business in the future!
2020-07-30,2,Won’t ever recommend purchasing a car from Inchcape Land Rover Norwich. They’re super lovely to you until you have a problem. Putting !! In an email when you ask a polite question about a refund to me is bad manners and offensive!! If you want great customer service Norfolk people go to Ben Kemp 4x4.

2020-07-29,1,"Poor experience

Had my golf r serviced at the Swindon dealership. When I went to collect my car they had misplaced my paperwork then found it just placed on a cabinet,I’m not surprised as there were 5 or 6 other customers paperwork just left on the desk with there details clearly on display. I told the girl that’s a GDPR breach and she just laughed. Once she had my paperwork the details were wrong and stated my car had covered 50-k miles more than it’s done. Then when I paid for the service plan almost £500 I got a call the following day saying I need to pay £30 more. I explained I paid yesterday and it turned out she didn’t do the payment properly. And said she will call the following day as I didn’t have my card to pay and wanted to check my paperwork again. She also said I’d receive a contract to sign for the service plan and that didn’t happen. After checking my paperwork I saw that the service advisories said the caps for the wheel nuts were missing and I can buy some from them. I know for a fact every wheel had all the wheel nut covers on them before it went in for a service and yet now I’m missing two Of the covers on two of my alloy wheels.
Had a call 3/4 days later. I told the girl my caps were missing,she basically ignored me and just wanted the £30 payment that was her mistake.
Eventually I got her to listen to the issue of the caps,I was told I’d receive a call before they closed and didn’t. It’s clear all she wanted was to fix her mistake and didn’t care about anything else.

Very disappointed from a Vw main dealer.

Had the reply so sent my registration and contact number and never heard from the head office. POOR SERVICE"
2020-07-29,1,"Took my one year old Range Rover Sport in for it's first service to Inchcape Derby. It has done just over 6000 miles in total. I get told it has warped disc brakes and they need replacing. Obviously, I refuse to pay for this after only so few miles on a car only a year old. The car has been sat there for a week now as while they agree it isn't right for this to happen, it is apparently out of warranty! A one year old car with 6000 miles, what a joke. Anyway, I have since had the time to check with a couple of approved Land Rover mechanics who tell me that this won't be the brake discs, but a defective braking system causing the brake discs to warp so something a lot more serious than just discs. Inchcape wanted me to drive this away and have me sort this out myself which I would say is very negligent. Currently talking to legal people about the situation while the car continues to sit in Derby...."

2020-07-27,3,"I took my car in for some repair which was carried out. The dealership had cleaned the car in & out which is a nice touch. However, when I returned home I noticed that they had dented both of the doors.
I am fastidious about my car and i had cleaned it before taking to the dealership. It had also not been used to go anywhere for at least 3 months due to covid prior to my cleaning it and taking to the dealership. I am so disappointed."
2020-07-26,5,"I registered my interest online with Mercedes-Benz dealer based in Nottingham and was contacted by Phil who arranged an appointment with me,i explained i did not want to rush into anything, his reply 'if you are happy with how I handle your interest i am sure you will change you mind'.
On arrival i was very excited, he introduced himself and sat me down. We went through the list that i was interested in.
Phil was amazing, being on my own he did not rush me, but as soon as i looked at the first vehicle in the showroom, i knew this was the one, (i had already researced) engrained in my thoughts my interest was to purchase a 'White' (My favourite colour) vehicle, we looked at all the colours, the silver for me outweighed and it was the first car I had looked at.
We were not able to test drive because of Covid-19. Phil proceeded to talk me through everything, and i was totally blown away with my choice of vehicle.
We sat down again Phil asked my thoughts and he then went through with me the next process.
Phil made me feel so comfortable to the point i was able to explain how i suffered with mental health and have done for many, many years. This is how safe and comfortable Phil made me feel, this is a biggie for me because i was not judged with my diaclosure and have never spoke out to anyone that does not know me.
Phil was so amazing, professional but also warm and friendly.
We placed my order and Phil kept me in contact by phone throughout.
I went to collect my vehicle on Friday 24th July 2020. On arrival i was nervous and full of Anxc through out the whole process, of which he picked up on straight away. His approach was very sensitive and calming. He went through all of the paperwork and then through all of the technical features, did not rush me, but it was too much information for me to take in and pricess. So he said that i could make another appointment once i had settled down with my new Merc.
Overall;
Professional service 100%
Experienced in the process and handling of the sale 100%
Awareness and Assertiveness 100%
Customer service and customer care 100%
Listening and engaging 100%

Carl the branch manager was very professional and helpful in the way he set my fiance up. I would highly recommend them and I personally would go back for another car eventually.

2020-07-24,5,"Been looking for a Vauxhall Adam for a while and found one online from this company and immediately fell in love. Went to the Burton branch and was helped out by Joseph Hind, he was absolutely amazing, made me feel comfortable and not pressured about anything. All the other team members were all very lovely and seemed to also give great service to their customers! Joe was so helpful and went through all my options and was very professional about it whilst also having chit chat and a good laugh. It was my birthday on the day I looked at the car and they went out their way to buy me some flowers and a card not only for my birthday but to apologise that I was waiting around for the finance to go through which I didn’t mind at all; they didn’t have to do this at all yet they went that extra step further; i think I had a happy birthday from every member of the team!! Test drove it and took it away the same day. Only one tiny scratch on the car which I’m not fussed on since it was such a great deal and the car is used. Absolutely amazing customer service from all members and will definitely be back in the future, will not go anywhere else!! One very happy customer!!"
2020-07-24,5,Staff were very polite and thorough. Really happy with the service.
2020-07-23,1,GOLF GTI- Inchcape have no interest in customer care or service after sale. The car had a fault on the dash on collection. Had to take car to VW 3 times in 10 days first to fix the original problem then for a new radiator as found to be leaking after “being service and approved checks”. When asked for a form of compensation for time and hassle after less than 2 weeks - They have no interest and that I can return the car at my own cost of 42p per mile used. Hardly a main dealer standard...
2020-07-22,5,"Today I took delivery of my new Mercedes from the Nottingham Mercedes branch and I was extremely happy with the service I received from Phil Litchfield who handles my new car purchase.

Firstly I have to say this garage took fantastic measures as regards the Covid situation . There was clearly marked floor spacing and protective screens at the sales desks and other measures in place as regards protecting the client whilst in the showroom.

Phil was extremely helpful and after discussing the car I wanted nothing was too much trouble with regard to sourcing the exact model and colour of Mercedes That I wanted . Once a car had been located Phil handled all the paperwork and sorted out my private plate transfer. I had my new car within 8 days and was always contacted very quickly when I called with any questions I had .

I would definately recommend this garage and Phil in particular as he made buying my new car a pleasant and straightforward experience."
2020-07-22,5,What can I say.. Professional professional professional! Pricing is bang on and you know you're getting the right work done. The team over in Guildford really do go the extra mile to make sure both you AND your vehicle are looked after. Excellent communication and friendly with it too. Will not be looking to go elsewhere any time soon!
2020-07-21,1,"Went to Oldham Inchcape to buy a Polo GTI The screen price was inflated by £2k more than the advertised price on the VW UK website. A second option had a similar issue but by £1k.

Shocking"
2020-07-21,1,"I booked a test drive at the end of May for the first day back open after the C-19 shutdown and paid my 99£ reservation fee.

When I got there a bit earlier I had a look at the car and found that there were scratches and had covered up dents on the back bumper, a huge crack in the front bumper and all 4 tyres had seen better days too. I know it is used car but this one didn't even look road save, but they still asked for almost 15k, with now room to make any adjustments to the price.
I decided not even to go for the test drive as it didn't feel save and asked for my deposit back.
I was told that obviously this is a new process and nobody really knows how it works, so it may take some time.

Long story short, eventually after 7 weeks of constant calling and emailing with the car dealer, headquarter and customer support, I finally got my 99£ back and didn't even get the interest that they got on it while keeping my money on their account."
2020-07-20,5,"My car was due for a brake fluid change and the major service was due in the not-to-distant future so I though I might as well get it all out of the way in one go. I visited the branch to drop the car off and all social distancing and extra hygiene measures were reassuringly in place.
The member of staff on the service desk was polite, friendly and knowledgeable. The courtesy car was clean and a model close to my own vehicle. All the work was carried out and, even with some extra work that needed to be carried out, the car was ready to pick up in the early afternoon. My car was clean inside and out and I am confident that the work carried out was done to a high standard."

I cannot praise these people highly enough."
2020-07-17,4,"Due to current circumstances had to book appt to view, then another appt to pick up, couldn't do it on the first day, which was a little annoying as it was a fair trip. Sale went smooth after that. Was promised mats and seat covering as part of deal, but they took 3 wks to materialise when promised a few days. A few phone calls did not do the job, so emailed the manager of the garage. It was then sorted and received in a few days. Thank you for that. Overall a good garage to deal with, just marked down because of the promised items."
2020-07-17,5,"I brought in my BMW X1 for its service to Cooper BMW at Durham and as always, the service was impeccable.
On arrival i was greeted by a member of the team and shown to the associate that was dealing with my car, she was friendy, professional and explaied what needed doing and that it should only take a few hours, she checked my details and said that my car would be washed and vacuumed when the work was completed.
I was shown to a new X1 Msport as a courtesy car which is perfect for me as I'm a disabled driver and the height of the car makes it easier and less painful for me to enter and exit.
I recieved a call a few hours later to say my car was ready for collection and that no faults had been found but they had updated my satnav for me.
All in all a very professional and thorough service carried out without issues at what can still be called a very strange time with the COVID19 restrictions still in place."

Original review - I bought my vehicle from Inchcape Preston December 2018, the paint on the front bumper has started to peel away only 18 months later. I took my vehicle in for photographs to be taken nearly three weeks ago to check whether the work to be carried out under warranty, I have contacted the dealership 4 times since and have been promised a phone call back on the same day. I am still awaiting any update or phone call, very frustrating and very poor customer service."
2020-07-15,5,"I have had a such a great customer service and sales experience at Inchacape Mercedes Nottingham NG2 that i had to share my feelings.
I have just bought a brand new Mercedes E220d SE from Philip Litchfield.
He has been so helpful with my requirements for the car which included price, colour, spec and delivered my expectations in a very timely manner.
The handover was seem less and painless. It was done in a very courteous and professional and enjoyable manner and Phil respected the social distancing from the start to the end.
He has been always available on the end of the phone if had any queries pre & post sales.
I am already looking forward to my after sales & service experience going forward and I am sure that I will experience the same experience with team.
I would strongly recommend anyone buy a new car from Phil
Good Job - Nottingham Mercedes"

2020-07-14,1,"I would like to make a complaint about the service i received from the Guildford Branch. I feel I can now deal with the complaint after my worrying experience. Thinking i was buying a car from a reputable company and dealerahip that guarantees customer satisfaction I bought the car on line, paid the full amount £24.142.00 and a £20 bank transfer. I travelled 4 hrs to collect the car, £60 in fuel. When the vehicle was presented to say i was shocked is an understatement. The car had apparently just recived a new MOT, a number of MOT advisory issues had not been resolved as discussed with staff, the car was not prepared or valeted, it had food and dirt on the seats and upolstery, a cracked rear light cluster, a cut in the rear tyre, rips and stains on the leather seats a Cracked speaker, at this point i had to stop looking at the car to gather my thoughts. The fact that l had paid for the vehicle in full, it was not in a satisfactory condition , i had travlled 4 hrs to collect the vehicle left me with the impression the team thought i would just accept it and take the vehicle home. The video i was sent made no effort to mention all the other issues and the promises had not happened. I cancelled the order and travelled 4 hrs back home. I left with the promise of an immediate refund. From my initial payment I had to wait 10 days to get any money back and this was only due to my persistence calling the Guildford branch trying to sort out the refund. During this time waiting for the refund i received the vehcle docs and i was nearly sick at my work thinking the vehicle would arrive on my drive because the refund was taking so long and the lack of communication from the Branch. I feel that the Inchcape customer satisfaction guarantee needs to be addressed , buying a car for £24,000 or £150,000 we are still customers paying for goods and a service. I was made to feel like a second class citezen whether on purpose or through in competence of staff . I am out of pocket £80 for costs, I have lost a days work and feel distrustfull, anxious of Inchcape representation as an approved car dealership. A positive experience was finaly receiving the refund through contact with Brett Wigins.
Personally I would like to be reimbursed £80 my incurred cost, not much in the scheme of things but its still my loss from something that could of been avoided if as stated, customer service guarantee was at the forefront of all the Guildford Team.

2020-07-14,5,"I have had a Mercedes for just over 2 years and purchased it from Inchcape Mercedes - Nottingham after being ignored at my local Mercedes retailer.

Nottingham were welcoming and I was lucky enough to have Phil Litchfield deal with me and sell me my current car. From day one Phil has been an absolute star and someone I believed I could trust. He has kept in touch on a regular basis long after picking up my car.

Having recently returned to Mercedes for some W arranty work I have been seriously impressed by the customer service skills of all the staff on site. Even during the current COVID-19 issues I have felt safe and welcomed on site.

In particular a shout out to both Yolanta and Louise. Both have been excellent in dealing with my issues and ensuring I am fully informed of what is happening. In particular Louise is so bubbly and friendly that I can away with a smile on my face and feeling that I wanted her to deal with me again.

On this last visit I was very surprised to learn, on arrival, that they had managed to source a loan car for me even though I had not specifically booked one.

Every time I have dealt with Inchcape Nottingham they have exceeded my expectations and I will be back soon to see if I can get a deal on my next car.

Many thanks to all involved."

2020-07-13,1,"I booked the first service for my Mercedes C Class at the Inchcape Derby dealership, Inchcape couldn't honour the booking so I was forced to cancel. After a month and numerous emails / calls I have yet to be reimbursed. No one has even bothered to call me back. The service is dreadful and this has tarnished the brand for me."

2020-07-11,5,"I have just picked up my brand new Mercedes GLB 220 from Mercedes benz Nottingham. After a long hard slog with many months debating (sorry Phil) I have finally got the keys to my first Mercedes car. I have to say Phil Lichfield is an outstanding sales person and a credit to Mercedes i have got to know him over what seems quite a long time, we have almost become good mates. I can't fault his patience and understanding over what has become a very trying period in life for me personally but even on his days off, evenings, he has always responded to my calls or messages nothing seemed to be too much of a problem, it probably was but he didn't show it. Like it or not Phil, mate, when it comes to my next Merc, as long as you are there I will make sure you do the deal. Sorry to be a pain but thats the way it is. If you want a Mercedes in Nottingham ask for Phil Lichfield. I am sure he will sort you out. Shout out for the girls on reception too. oh not to mention Craig who reminded me of Fred Elliot. Sorry mate. Great service great cars. Very nice people."

When purchasing a brand new car (with lots of challenges sales & mechanical) from Inchcape Southampton I was sold a 3 years car care plan insurance by the sales men and only after 18 months made a claim for 2 small paint scratches on the front doors! Sent all necessary photos but in spite of many follow ups no response was ever received from this company. Contacted Inchcape as they should also be assisting being brokers & there again no response. Appalling customer service & a complete waste of £ 500! Don't subscribe!"

I drove into the garage - was welcomed and given clear instructions.
Payment was taken by a card machine brought to me by a member of the team wearing a mask & gloves (PPE).
I didn't need to leave the car or burst a bubble.
The whole experience was smooth and took less time than usual.
Thank you."
2020-07-09,1,"Dreadful. July 2020. I visited the Swindon Inchcape VW Dealership which was 100 mile return journey and agreed a specific time to view a 24k used VW Tiguan R Line with 27000 miles. To my disappointement, the battery was flat, one tyre was flat, there were cobwebs in the wheel arches and wing mirrors, and plant life and moss cultivating in the windscreen tray. The car appeared to have sat in the same place for circa 4 months with multiple scratches and stone chips. I appreciate we have been in lockdown but why did they agree for me to view the car in such a state without warning me of the condition.The online pictures were obviously taken before lockdown. I was excited before hand, ready to buy a car, and moved funds to do so. I was totally put off after seeing the car in such a poor condition with the Salesperson almost giving me the impression that it was no big deal. I was encouraged by a Manager to give the Dealership a second chance whilst they ‘prepped’ the car – which I was prepared to do, however this ended up as a further waste of my time, waiting for someone to contact me. Whilst I was waiting for a response the car which I had paid £99 to hold became available for anyone else to secure – good luck. I appreciate lockdown has changed the way we do things, however this is an example of poor practice and standards one would not expect from as VW Dealership. No I will not be visiting Inchcape VW Swindon again."

2020-07-07,1,"Customer service at Cooper was terrible. I booked four weeks in advance because I knew they would be busy. Despite doing so my service was postponed to the following week. I specifically requested a software update when handing the bike in and was assured it would be done, they had my bike for three days, so plenty of time to get it done. On collecting the bike I asked, and was assured it had been done. When I got home I found it had not. Cooper staff are cynical and untruthful."
2020-07-06,1,"Although we are a cash buyer the salesman insisted that we, and he, would benefit most from their finance package...he said he could only offer us the extra 1 year warranty, breakdown cover and two services - 1 major and 1 minor service - if we took their finance package and thus he made his commission. He then said we could pay it off straight away without incurring much interest. Which he couldn’t prove by showing us the Terms and conditions of the finance, they were not available for me to read in advance. He said I would receive them after i had signed the agreement and could not find them to email them to me or even provide a copy to read through while on site. I have read VW finance reviews on trust pilot... I suggest you check for yourself. The salesman needed us to sign up for the finance deal to get his commission."
2020-07-06,1,"1. Comms : Poor; cannot call salesman, who seems to be either with a customer (i am a customer!) or across the other side of the site (Jag-Landrover split is silly)
2. You may get a call after hours, the salesman telling you that he is doing you a favour calling you then
3. Test drive, fine, all ok
4. 34deg C, ineffective aircon, but not a drink to be had for 4hours i was on site; they could find water to drizzle over the test sample fabrics to sell you some scotchguard or similar but not to drink - pathetic to be honest, irrespective of social distance. you can buy drinks in a shop but not get a drink of water when buying a jag in guildford
5. Buying process, gosh where to start. I am payign cash, an easy buy, why i have to sit for 3 hours waiting while sales ""executive"" runs back n forth to the actual decision maker (salesmaner??) i cannot fathom, add on service packages, car treatments at price points that offer no value, i dont want them thank you; i'll have to tell the sales manager - well bring him here, i will tell him and we can buy the car and leave! gosh it was ridiculous
6. Delivery - ha!
7. Once delivered, same issue with comms - its cos we are busy - not my problem. i bought a car from you, give me some respect
8. Data Protection and use of personal information. A complete joke. No matter how many times you tell them the number to call on they go to a different one.
9. Cash purchase - i do not want finance, so why do you give me quotes for me to consider. that is hard sell and am minded to report to the FCA/FSA or whomever

Summary : great fantastic car; organisation needs remedial work and the maladministration needs addressing. Comms is pathetic, if I ran my business this way id not be able to buy a car."
2020-07-05,1,"Southampton Land Rover. Once again I am shocked by the dreadful service department.

Air conditioning broke on our RR sport after it was in for two days getting fixed last year. However they had no record of it being in so I was told that it was not covered to get fixed under their warranty. £180 just to look at it."

2020-07-03,1,I recently bought a new Golf from Inchacape. I have now discovered that the functionality for voice activation to my calls requires a code that will cost £294. Incidently my previous car a Hyundai i30 had this funtion. I should have been told about this. When I suggested that I would have haggled for this basic funtion I was told that I had a decent discount anyway. This is totally irrelevent and I feel dishonest in its sales techniques. I was then offered to pay £234 cost price for this function. I have spoken to another deslership who couldnt comment but said thst they were honest about telling people the addional cost of this feature. If you want an honest purchase then my advice is dont buy from Inchape unless you have all the details. Dont expect them to tell you anything. They just want a sale!

Overall poor experience. Very quick to persuade and convince you to leave a £99 deposit however best of luck to anyone who has a change of heart on the vehicle and would like their deposit back as it’s near enough IMPOSSIBLE. Constantly being fobbed off, emails ignored until you CC in the general manager. Usually refunds take 3-5 days, I’ve been waiting over 2 weeks now and I have still not received my money back.

2020-06-23,1,"I handed this letter of complaint to the service department, addressed to the Business Manager, Richard Skinner and was assured he would get in touch to address my concerns. I've heard nothing, which just goes to show what a lousy, poorly-managed company this is, and that you had best avoid them at all costs. Customer care is NOT their priority.

17th June 2020

I wish to complain about the poor service that I received from the dealership when I brought my car in for some work. I had requested a diagnostics check, an oil service, and an MOT, in that order.
The car is a 2006 M3 convertible model. The reason for the diagnostics check was that the DSC light intermittently illuminated on the dash, in orange, suggesting that the fault was not with the ABS braking itself, but more that the sensor was faulty.
I brought the car into the dealership at 09.00 on 16th June and left it there for the day. I received a phone call at 16.42 that day to advise that following the diagnostics test the mechanic was advising that the ABS sensors be replaced or else the car would fail its MOT test. During the call, I established the cost of the 2 sensors was going to be around £500, plus labour, plus I would require a brake fluid change. I was told that the order had to be placed for the sensors within ten minutes or else the spare parts distributor would have closed.
Quite aside from the astronomical price for the sensors, and the whole issue about electronics failing in a car that has done just 60,000 miles, what I do feel strongly about is that the dealership should have called me as soon as the diagnostics were performed, along with the accompanying fault codes. Assumedly, since my car was one of the first booked in, that call should have been in the morning, and that would have given me time to consider my options. As it was, I had 10 minutes to agree to the work or not. Clearly, the MOT had not been carried out, and it is debatable whether the oil service had been done, meaning that the car had been with you for seven hours without anything done to it. Had the phone call been earlier in the morning, I would not have needed to leave my car unnecessarily for a second day at the dealership. I might even have considered tracking down a cheaper solution.
To be fair to Wendy, she was able to obtain a discount on the sensors for me after I protested at the cost, along with a reduced labour charge. However, I do have the feeling that that the whole aim of calling me so late was to enable the dealership to secure the job of replacing the sensors, and in this I feel that I have been ripped off.

What also hurts is that in performing the job of bleeding the brake fluid, the mechanic managed to sheer off one of the retaining nipples. When I queried today whether it would need a replacement, Wendy enquired if I should like her to obtain a price for me. Frankly, I am astounded. You have a duty of care to look after any vehicle that is submitted for service yet should your mechanic break anything then the dealership absolves itself from replacing the broken item. I have no idea of the cost involved here, but I do expect the dealership to pay for a replacement when I choose to have it replaced, whether at your dealership or elsewhere.
I will settle the bill when I pick up the car later today, but I do so under protest. It has been my first visit to Cooper BMW in Durham and it will be my last. I bought my car new from Mill BMW, and was very satisfied with the work they did. I then tended to use Lloyd BMW in Newcastle, but since they were closed at the time of booking due to covid, I chose to visit Durham. I am not happy, and this will be reflected in my online reviews about the dealership.

I did in fact leave a poor review on the company website, but unsurprisingly it has been removed."
2020-06-23,1,"Purchased an approved used car from Cooper Colchester. The car was delivered with numerous faults, car wouldn't stay locked with the comfort access, needed a replacement door handle. There was overspray all down the side of the car from a poor paint repair and the rear bumper had damage to the paint meaning that I had to get it resprayed and the car polished to remove the overspray, the dealer only contributed £100 of the cost of this. The battery now also needs to be replaced. The alloy wheels were refurbished before I purhcased the car and now one of the wheels is cracking all over the face! Cooper colchester will not help at all with this and say its not their responsibility... The car was also delivered with fauly air conditioning which they also wont cover and is not covered under warranty, leaving me with an additional £1000 bill. The sales experience was great, very helpful at the point of me purchasing the car, although after sales service is awful!!! Having spoken to a manager, initials M.B, over christmas period he showed no interest in helping me to resolve any of these issues, wouldn't even help me to obtain the v5 document number that I needed to mark my old car as sold, everything was too much hassle. A manager named Darren again showed no willingness to help with the issues with the car, and got argumentative. I wouldn't recommend this dealership for an approved used car. Having spoken to my local dealership about these issues, they certainly wouldn't have even provided the car in this condition!"
2020-06-23,1,"I have been so very disappointed with the sales service given by Inchcape Swindon when I had a query about a refund due to me. It was only when the managing director finally got involved , four months after lockdown that my query was addressed and resolved."

2020-06-19,5,"I’ve had issues with my newly purchased BMW 1 series. Initially it was challenging however, your Aftersales manager David, took over and this man has done everything for me, credit where credit is due.

I haven’t been an easy customer to please, and I’m not when things go wrong - more so with a brand new car! But David, has went above and beyond, with updates, feedback.

The car is still been looked at but, I have absolute faith it will be sorted either way.

Top marks David.

Please ensure feedback is passed over to David’s line manager at the dealership!"
2020-06-18,1,"I took my Range Rover Evoque to the Preston branch for the N220 recall. My keys were taken from me by a charmimg young lady (E) who told me this particular upgrade consisted of an oil change and upgraded filter! Fine I thought as I hadn't actually checked it myself. Before I got my car back later that day, I was sent via email, a video showing the tread on my tyres was ok and on collection, the car had been washed and valeted. Lovely I thought. Silly me.

Driving home I noticed that the date and time showing was incorrect, but more irritatingly, the Auto off/on function had somehow been reversed. Now when the light was on, the function was off and with no light, it was on!

A couple of days later when I had the time, I went back to the dealership and again spoke to (E), and asked why the battery had seemingly been disconnected just for an oil change. She couldn't answer that but went away and came back saying she had rung the workshop but that the supervisor wasn't available but she would send him an email and get back to me. I departed but on returning home, I checked what recall N220 involved and it was an engine emissions upgrade to the car's hardware/software. So little wonder it had affected the electronics. Nothing at all to do with an oil change (E)!

Over a week later and not having heard anything further, I again went back to Inchcape, asked for (E) who told me she hadn't had a response as yet from the supervisor, but that she would go to the workshop to see if he was available. She came back shortly afterwards with a guy who said as he passed me, he would be with me shortly. About 5 minutes later, a totally different guy came out and asked me where my car was. I told him and gave him the keys. He then told me it would be about an hour but that due to Covid restrictions, I wasn't allowed to wait inside. Strange thought I given this was the day that non-essential shops had been allowed to open and there was plenty of customers already sitting around but hey ho. I didn't bother as I wanted to have a look around the cars for sale outside anyway. After about an hour though, I decided I had had enough and wandered back inside and found a seat. I sat there for another 30 or so minutes without anybody telling me I shouldn't be there. Indeed, when (E) brought back my keys, she didn't say a word either, other than to say that the software had been upgraded again and the problem had been fixed.

Hurray I thought….. until I hit the road again and found exactly the same problem. The Autostop function was off when the light was illuminated and on when it was not. So it had not been fixed and had anybody bothered to check, they would have seen it was not fixed!

Yes this is a minor problem in the greater scheme of things, but to my mind, any company that is more interested in the grand gestures (videos and valeting) rather than getting the little things right, does not deserve my patronage and certainly will not be getting it again.

I love my Evogue and will probably buy a Range Rover again, but I won't be getting it from Inchcape, Preston; a typical 'fur coat and no knickers' dealership."
2020-06-18,1,"I would not bother with Inchcape - they clearly don't need the money from selling cars - go elsewhere.

We were trying to buy a brand new Land Rover (so not cheap); made an appointment to visit Inchcape in York. Just over an hour before the appointment, the salesman rang and left a message saying that they now had an internal meeting at that time (internal meeting rather than a sales meeting??!!) and could we do later that day. I rang back immediately, left a message with the receptionist - that was a week ago and no one has rung me back.

We have since bought a lovely new LR from Hatfields in Pickering."

I’ve only given 4 stars as as I was sat waiting for a new tyre fitted I noticed one of the sales men chatting to a customer despite plastic screens and social distance measures in place both the member of staff and the customer where stood far too close, I mentioned this to the receptionist that acknowledged what I was observing but gave the impression she was powerless to do anything.

As an employee of the NHS I’m very disappointed that I observed such behaviour during such an extreme pandemic."

I was assured my vehicle would be the first booking of the day for a routine first service which would take between one and a half and two hours. I arrived at 8.00am as agreed. It is now approaching 11.00 am and still not finished. Fobbed off and avoided when trying to establish the status of the job. If you can go somewhere else, then I strongly recommend you do."
2020-06-08,5,"The Range Rover Evoque is an excellent 4 wheel drive car drives like a dream I have had a Range Rover for over 20 years from Hunters Southampton to use in my Business.
Here's to another 20 years trouble free motoring."
2020-06-06,5,"I just wanted to leave a review for Inchcape Jaguar Land Rover and in particular Darren and Craig.

Darren took my call during lockdown and has kept me updated on the restrictions in place, until they were eased.

I was able to pick up my Range Rover yesterday from Derby.
All relevant information was sent beforehand.

Myself and my wife felt safe in the environment provided by Inchcape during the handover.

The handover was professional and everything explained.
Both Darren and Craig explained everything about the car with the enthusiasm as if it was their first car sale.

This was followed up this morning by a follow up call from Darren to see if everything was okay.

I am a bit long in the tooth, but in this present day, you just do not get customer service like this any more.

This is the first review I have written, but I felt I must I must credit certain people when they actually care about something.

Pete."
2020-06-05,1,"Poor customer service. Just called the Inchcape service booking line. Spoke to a very unhelpful individual who quoted a higher price than on line and refused to match the online price. He then told me they'd surcharge me for paying with an Amex card. Finally, he told me I live too far away to arrange a collection. I bought my Range Rover from them but I won't be buying another from them. Dreadful service and lousy attitude."
2020-06-04,5,Bought a new car from VW Manchester. Excellent service provided by Paul who was very knowledgeable. Would highly recommend.
2020-06-03,5,"I just wanted to leave a review for Mercedes Benz Liverpool and Martin in particular.
I had excellent service from start to finish when ordering my new car.
Delivery was quicker than anticipated.
Just 8 weeks instead of 12.
I have had the car for 9 months now and have had absolutely no problems at all, which is a refreshing change from the garage who supplied my last vehicle which turned out to be a lemon and was recalled after a very serious incident.
Before lockdown and now some restrictions have been eased I have been kept fully updated and given a phone number and email to contact the dealership if I required assistance.
Extremely professional and a first class service.
I will definitely be a return customer.
As the parent of a severely disabled child it is so important to me to have a reliable and safe car and a dealership that I can trust.
Thank you"
2020-05-29,1,"Purchased used RR sport 12mth ago which was supplied with 2yr LR warranty.
At time of purchase I was convinced to purchase an additional 2yr warranty totalling 4yr.
After owning the vehicle approx 5mth I discovered the additional 2yr I purchased at a cost of almost £1300 was not actually LR warranty but Inchcape warranty.
I believe this was mis-sold as it was not explained when purchased plus I never received any details of what Inchcape warranty covers.
I have since spoken to numerous sales & service personnel at the York branch face to face whom have noted down my concerns and assured me someone would be in touch.
I have done this 4 times and still no-one has contacted me, I even had the vehicle serviced there 2 months ago at a cost of over £1000 and still no-one was interested in speaking with me about my concerns.
They were quick to take my money but don’t want to know me now!
I will not use Inchcape again for any vehicle purchases....I would highly recommend that people buy from main dealership and avoid these poor managed franchise groups."
2020-05-26,1,"Inchcape Preston has appalling after sales service. Booked vehicle in for service and confirmed courtesy car available. Recontacted a week later to say the courtesy car is no longer available with no explanation. 2 further phone calls and email request for service manager to contact me to discuss the issues still not recontact 2 weeks later. Very disappointed, I might have expected this from other retailers I thought Inchscape Preston would be different!!"
2020-05-07,1,"Called am 7.5.20 and lady who answered phone sounded like she was half asleep, i was promised a call back to book vehicle in for June but no call, i appreciate it is difficult circumstances but no excuse, not the first time i have received poor service from this dealership.
**And still no call as of the 12.5.20**"
2020-04-25,1,"I purchased a 3 year-old Land Rover Discovery First Edition with under 10k miles on the clock from the Southampton branch on the 13th of March 2020. Within 2 weeks I discovered clear and extensive rodent damage to the vehicle under the bonnet, along with crackling speakers and an unpleasant smell. There is no way that the 165 point check had been completed on this car as promised. I rejected the vehicle but was told that I could not return it due to the Covid lockdown, nor could I have my money back! This left me without a vehicle as a key worker. Inchcape are more than happy to keep taking deposits from people but apparently could not process my refund! I was forced to gain the support of the finance company and threaten a smalls claims court application in order to get my money back, this was an incredibly difficult task to achieve. No apologies have been offered, no support or solution put forward to keep me on the road in a safe and roadworthy vehicle, just the most abysmal customer service that I have ever received. The car is back on their forecourt right now so beware of buying the low mileage 3 year-old Discovery. You have been warned."
2020-04-21,1,"Got a brand new Jaguar XF on a lease through my small business, paid for it in full for a 3 year term, only actually had the car a few months as went in and out of garage 15 times! Couldn’t fix the dangerous steering fault. Terrible customer service, poor car quality, and they trespassed on my property in the middle of the night to remove a courtesy car (containing all my newborn baby’s items) without any advance warning. They never returned my baby’s items. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE."
2020-04-10,1,"I have already left a review on Google in January and disappointingly, no word back from the dealership to put matters right. First service on my Range Rover Vogue and my one major concern was ignored (battery losing charge after 2 days). During the service they simply re-charged the battery (partially) despite I explained there was an underlying issue but it was not investigated at all. Add blue tank cap was unscrewed and left loose under the bonnet and no fluid added. I left wondering what else had not been done. Very poor and would not recommend as I have already reviewed and no one bothered to call me to put matters right. I expected much more when I paid so much for a new Range Rover and the servicing costs."
2020-04-08,5,"I would like to personally thank Jamie and his team for all of their help and support during the COVID period. I am a nurse on the Wirral and contacted Jamie as i needed an oil change. I received a call back within 10 minutes and was booked In for the next day, I was provided with advice on the social distancing arrangements to expect on my arrival which provided assurance. On my arrival I was taken to a waiting area and was able to wait whilst the team carried out the necessary work on my car to ensure I am able to keep going to work.
I have to say the service provided by Jamie and his team was A star and I was left feeling completely humbled when Jamie told me to put my credit card away and that it was on them. What a fabulous team and I will be ever grateful, il be sure to clap for them on Thursday and the team for their hard work to ensure that we are kept on the road.
A BIG BIG THANK YOU YOU IT REALLY MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERNCE 🌈🙏🌈🙏"
2020-03-31,1,"Due to a combination of a poorly designed vehicle and abject customer service on behalf of Inchcape Land Rover Southampton I am owed the sum of £149.97 as reimbursement for a hire car I had to pay for while my vehicle was being repaired with a steering rack fault which caused the bolts holding the motor onto the steering rack to shear off.

Despite the JLR Customer Experience team requesting that I was provided with a courtesy there were none available at the dealership. An attempt was made by Inchcape Land Rover Southampton to source a hire car through Enterprise; however, this could not be provided as they had not updated their address details on their Enterprise account following the move to their new multi-million pound premises in November 2018. I paid for the hire car myself on the understanding that I would be reimbursed for the costs up to £50 per day.

The invoice for three days car hire was submitted on 10 March and I provided my bank account details to the Customer Experience Manager at Inchcape Land Rover Southampton on 12 March. Despite chasing I still have not received the money I am owed 3 weeks later. I am well aware that their operations have been impacted by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic; however we are living in an age when, with little more than a computer and an internet connection, money can be transferred between accounts with the click of a few buttons.

While our vehicle was in for repair an attempt was made to defraud me of money by the service department fabricating work required to our vehicle. A vehicle health check was performed on 05 March and the tyre tread depths were flagged as ‘Red – Urgent’ as they were worn to between 1.6mm and 2.5mm. On the Inchcape Land Rover Southampton website a Red category is defined as ‘Due to safety reasons, a repair needs to be completed urgently.’ The website further states that ‘We would suggest that you do not drive your vehicle if you get a Red result as it means we deem it unsafe’. A second vehicle health check was performed on 09 March and the tyre tread depths were recorded as ‘Amber – Advisory’ items and the level of tread remaining on each tyre had increased to between 3.0mm and 3.5mm. I checked the tyres prior to leaving the vehicle with the dealership and all tread depths were above 3.0mm.

I know that Service Advisors at the dealership are on an incentive-based scheme for sale of parts/work, so this is a clear attempt to extort money from me.

The whole ownership experience with our vehicle has been a catalogue of poor customer service from Inchcape Land Rover Southampton with faults that should have been picked up during its multi-point inspection (reversing sensors not working, Land Rover InControl not working, boot light not working) and supplying the car with mats for a left hand drive model which dangerously obstructed the accelerator and brake pedals.

I know people will be seduced by the new luxury showroom but I would sincerely urge you to avoid Inchcape Land Rover Southampton at all costs if you value honesty and good customer service.

UPDATE 01 April 2020 (following the reply from Inchcape Retail UK):
I know its April Fools day but are you seriously suggesting that there is no-one in your whole organisation who has access to a computer and the internet to electronically transfer the money I am owed to my bank account?

Perhaps I'll try that excuse with my mortgage company, energy company and internet provider to see if i can avoid paying my bills like Inchcape do!"
2020-03-29,1,"If you want to buy a car blind, with no spec, get a poor deal and spend almost 10 hours in the showroom then buy a VW At Inchcape. Sorry but I do not trust you. You seem to have adopted the US practice of dragging it out to sell more add-ons. I wanted a 2 litre manual diesel. My previous brand only produced automatics. VW drivers mock Peugeot drivers. All I can say is when I have bought one I knew what I was buying. No hidden surprises and not a long list of extras. The Car is well built and drives well but not worth the ‘brand’ tax. After all most of it is made outside of Germany. Cruise / Speed limit a hazard. You have to take your eyes off the and go thro 3-4 control options. Breaks come on when going down hill in cruise. No control over mileage trips. Automatically reset when refueling / stopped for more than a short time. They have pandered to the Smart phone brigade encouraging drivers to spend more fiddling in the car than concentrating on the road ahead. To finish website designed to drive you to showroom rather than allow constructive research. Forgot to mention folding door mirror heaters not part of rear screen heating!!!
Inchcape’s does acknowledge the issues. Most of it is in the hands of the local manager. If it is VW policy not produce brochures then sales staff should be provided a spec folder with each model with a tick sheet for comparison between different model variants am list of optional extras. It is not expensive and not rocket science, your sneered at competitors do it. you could get rid of half the sales staff as customers would not be spending up to four in the showroom on each visit. I run a business. Customer want transparency and honesty not smoke screens."

2020-03-26,1,"My son recently had a service and mot done at the Trafford Park depot, they failed it and told him he couldn’t drive the vehicle away, even though there was 3 weeks left on the existing MOT certificate
They wanted to charge him over £600 for the work. He came home without the van but checked their “facts”
Of course it was a pack of lies, he then had to go back and get the van. He eventually got the work done plus the MOT for less than half price from another garage
You would think that a main dealer would stand for honesty, trust and integrity, not this lot
Stay well away, Don’t trust them"
2020-03-25,5,Excellent service despite the difficult times. I was lucky to get it done on the last open day
2020-03-20,1,"My elderly mother took her car into VW telford on Wednesday morning for a minor repair to a headlight bracket. She has only ever purchased VW's and had finally saved up her retirement money for a brand new car in September 2019. It was her pride and joy. On arrival, staff at the dealership were unhelpful from the onset. My mother enquired about her service intervals and when her first service was due. The female staff member told her to ""look in your service book"", which wasn't particularly helpful or courteous. it was a simple question, and one they could easily have advised on.

Little more than a couple of hours later my mother received a phone call from the dealership, to inform her that whilst on a 'test drive' the engineer has been involved in a collision in her car. There was some damage to the rear of her vehicle. They neither apologised or offered a courtesy vehicle, as smugly indicated, they didn't have any!

Following the call, my mother was extremely upset and distressed, so I immediately took her to the garage. Again no one apologised, but instead she was made to feel like she was over reacting by even being upset. They reiterated that there were no courtesy cars available, and she would have to liaise with their insurance company directly. She advised that garage manager that she was not happy to have the repairs done, as had purchased a new car with the knowledge that it had not been in any accident. The accident would also affect the resale value of the car. She asked if she could swap the car for an identical model of the same mileage and age. They just laughed and said no. They did not even offer to consider this as an option, despite her obvious distress.

She left the garage in floods of tears; still without a car and with the additional inconvenience of having to arrange this herself with Inchcape insurers. Several phone calls ensued between herself and head office, but they declined to even consider allowing her to swap her car or assist with the provision of a courtesy car. This is despite the fact that she is 70 years of age and recently recovered from cancer treatment. She is also extremely vulnerable given the current Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent restrictions. I am completely appalled.

I contacted VW head office UK for advice, as wasn't sure why the car was being driven by the engineer following the replacement of a headlight bracket. Is this usual practice? My mother has always purchased VW cars, but this experience has been so appalling, she would never want such an experience again. I realise that the dealership are a franchise - which wasn't clear when she purchased the car. The brand VW is synonymous with quality and excellent customer satisfaction; but I fear this dealership (Inchcape) are in danger of irrevocably damaging this perception.

Upon collecting the vehicle to take to the body repair shop, my mother was issues with a £272 bill foe a headlight bracket. She declined to pay, until the damage to her car (caused by their technician) had been rectified. They then called the police and emailed myself whilst at work, threatening me for taking the car and not paying MY. Again they informed myself that they had informed the police as I had not paid the bill. I have confirm I has enough nor ever will be a customer of Inchcape, and I cannot comprehend why I was threatened in this manner. The incident has been completely abhorrent, unprofessional, and immoral.

I would give this company a very wide berth and steer clear of them. There are many reputable car companies including Listers and Pendragon. This company is full of deceitful charlatans. I sincerely hope the current economic climate hits them hard."

2020-03-11,1,"Shocking, bought a cooper s advertised at 23K on the clock and all paper work said 23K, after handover and all paper work completed a few weeks later I noticed the miles look high and I looked at the paper work and it was over 10K miles extra.
I mentioned it to the sales people and they blamed me for not checking, which put my back right up, so I asked for a full refund or to let me put more money in towards a new car. It felt like they laughter at me when I mentioned that and they said “we will of you £250 good will
gesture”, which I turned down. I told them I’m taking them to court as I’ve got all the paperwork of miles advertised and I phoned Inchcape and they confirmed it was advertised at 23k on the clock.
After a huge fight they refunded me the money to put me in a newer car, but the stares and they way they all gang together made me feel Intimidated and bullied.
Also telling people like the manager and sales person told me “make sure you give us a 5 star review as you have got a good deal, if not don’t write a review” I s disgusting behaviour, which creates fake reviews in Chelmsford Mini

So today 7/3/22 I called them at mid-day and talked to
Gill who arranged for Harry to call me and that never happened !! So an hour later I called Gill again and she passed me to Adrian Day the sales manager who told me to come to the show room and he will get one of the guys to see us.
After 1 hour and 20 min travel we got there and met up with Adrian and then Gareth, we chatted for a while and he arranged for us to do a Test drive and then all went quiet and could see them arguing in the office and finally Gareth came out to tell us that we cannot do a Test Drive as the car is flat and they cannot even open the doors.
This was so annoying as we have traveled afar and our day was wasted. Such an unprofessional behavior from VW.

2020-03-04,2,"I took my car back because an alloy was damaged by the dealership before I collected it when bought. There were 2 other issues with the car that became present less than 10 days after collecting the car (SatNav SD card not working and Start&stop feature stopped working). I live in Nottingham and I was told that to have the alloy fixed for free (as they damaged it), I had to take my car to Leicester (in an email they promised they would put fuel in my car to compensate for the trip). The sales representative that sold me the car went to work for another company and whenever I called to organise this I was promised by reception a call back, which never happened. Eventually, and after 2 emails, the last one asking about the complaints procedure, I received a call and booked the car in. Among other things, I was surprised to be told that I had to pay £15 if I wanted to have a loan car with a reduced insurance excess instead of £1,000 (it was the dealership's fault I had to travel to Leicester from Nottingham, as they damaged the car). When I arrived, the person in charge of my appointment didn't even know that I needed to have the alloy fixed, and only had noted the other two issues. They promised they would do a free health check, polish another alloy that had some scuffs and give me a tyre cap dust cover as one was missing. I was told they would do it on the day, so I decided to wait there and work from the dealership on my laptop. They fixed the alloy (none of the other things promised were done), replaced the Satnav SD card because they didn't know what happened with it, and told me that they hadn't checked the start&stop problem but that I would have to leave the car overnight at a Mercedes garage as they would need to probably recharge the auxiliary battery. Needless to say, they didn't put any fuel in my car as promised or even apologised for damaging the alloy in the first place and not having done any of the other things they said they would do. Luckily, I don't live in Leicester, and although I bought the car there I won't be going back to that dealership unless this is completely unavoidable. I only hope the dealership in Nottingham is better, although it is managed also by Inchcape."
2020-03-03,5,Been having my car serviced here for the past three years excellent service and staff would definitely recommend.
2020-03-03,2,I have given 2 stars because of the way my case was dealt with in the Service department. I was never updated and I always had to chase for an update every single day. Even to the point of the courtesy car which was not a like for like car. This was my first time dealing with the Service department and I am so far not impressed.
2020-03-03,5,"Having recently bought a Discovery Sport from Inchcape Land Rover York, I would highly recommend sales consultant Matthew Downing.
His product knowledge, patience, efficiency and assistance during the sales process was exemplary.
Flawless and professional service despite a little hiccup during the process.
Thank you and you made the beginning of my Land Rover Experience a real pleasure."
2020-03-02,1,"This is the response I got when I was told my case would be fully investigated! I was meant to have known at the point of sale that I was lied to?! Again proving that it is ok and accepted for BMW employees to lie to their customers to induce a sale. I sent photographic and video evidence that supports what I am saying and still that it is ignored.

Good Afternoon Mrs A

Thank you for your recent correspondence, documentation provided, after our investigations directly with the Croydon BMW Retailer, at your time of purchase you will have signed the order form, Invoice and finance documents to state you have agreed to the terms and conditions, at any time should you have had any doubts regarding the vehicle you were purchasing, it would be the buyers decision to decline the sale as with all purchases made.

As you agreed and signed the relevant documentation 2 years ago, our findings are that this would not be a case of the vehicle being mis-sold, should you still feel your issue is unresolved, you can contact the Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure operated by National Conciliation Service, further details are obtainable from their website,

UPDATE: Just got a call from the ‘investigator’ who confirmed that despite hearing the recorded telephone conversations I sent in, where the sales consultant confirms he gave false and misleading information and where the investigator at the time said he was ‘miffed’ I raised a complaint, that it is ok for BMW employees to lie to customers to get a sale. And there is nothing that I can do about it! But if I stop making the monthly payments let’s see how they would not be so forgiving."
2020-03-02,1,"Never again.

The salesman at Inchcape Mercedes Benz Coventry was our 'best friend' when he wanted to sell us a car but the minute he had our money, the customer service stopped.

When we went to collect the car, the satnav didn't work, the tyres were extremely borderline (our reliable tyre company said the car should never have been sold with those tyres on), there was masking tape around the grill even though the car had supposedly been through the valet department, there were marks on the body work that I had to polish off (I'm pretty sure this car never even saw the valet department). I could go on and on, and as for the lack of communication, well, when they promise to ring you back, take it with a very large pinch of salt... I think they only have an incoming line, not an outgoing line!

I have bought several Merecedes over the years from other garages and I have always been really pleased with them but it's safe to say that I will never be going back to Merecedes Benz Coventry (Inchcape) and I will also be warning my friends, several of whom also have Mercedes cars."
2020-03-01,1,"Put a £1,000 deposit down for a new I-PACE before it’s launch at Jaguar in Chester. Had absolutely no contact from them whatsoever and subsequently found out that the salesman had left and no one else seemed particularly interested.
My desire for the car had waned and the thought of paying over £70,000 to a dealership that I felt hadn’t valued my custom decided to ask for my deposit back.
That was early 2019. This was followed by telephone calls, recorded delivery letters sent in June and October and promises that someone would get back to me and the deposit would be refunded...but nothing.
Eventually, and only because someone in accounts (not sales) took ownership of the situation have we just had it repaid. Absolutely dire service. If I ran my business like this I’d go bust.
No apology either!
I’d previously purchased a new Evoque from JLR but they’ve now lost me to the brand which is sad because I do like their products even though the buying and servicing experience was average at best.
If you’re thinking of buying from JLR in Chester and you put a deposit down and don’t go ahead just be ready for a scrap to get it back.
No wonder JLR are struggling at the moment."
2020-02-29,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would without hesitation!!!

Had to employ DCBL (can’t pay take it away) debt recovery agency to get back my £2000 deposit on a car ( new F type) that I rejected because they couldn’t get it right, they never answer the phone when they eventually do here is the list of excuses.
1. He’s on annual leave
2. He’s away from his desk he will call you back ( never happened)
3. It’s his day off
4. He is on a training course
5. I can’t locate him at the moment
6. He’s in a sales meeting (5 hours long)
7. He’s out a test drive
8. He’s currently with another customer ( all day)

Customer service is a Joke!!! And they really do lie to you!!! If they put as much effort into their customer service as they do into the lies and excuses the dealership may actually be worth using.

Even lodging the complaint with Jaguar uk they didn’t want to know despite their claim to strive 100% customer satisfaction!!

Honestly this place is a circus, be extremely careful when buying form Jaguar Chester but if you are looking to buy a Jaguar look elsewhere"
2020-02-28,5,"Excellent service from Inchcape. They made sure that we were able to make an informed choice by giving us a very adequate test drive on several vehicles.Once our model choice was made they transferred our vehicle from another branch for us to view and try.

2020-02-27,1,"Inchcape Volkswagon Swindon.
Bought a used Skoda Octavia from Travis back at the end of August 2019 and have spent subsequent months trying to get various issues sorted to no avail. Here are the issues:
◾️As we live a long drive from Swindon requested a video and description of paintwork condition of car. Salesman told me there wasn’t a mark on it, in actual fact there were scuffs down one side and a number of paint chips on the front bumper which had badly been touched in.
◾️Within 5mins of driving car off the forecourt a warning light appeared on dash saying I had a flat tyre. Took it to the local garage at home and turns out I had an outer wall puncture so had to buy a new tyre for £90. Tyre was going down fast so dealer must have known about it
◾️10mm crack and two chips on the windscreen
◾️On autotrader listing car listed with CD player in two places, it doesn’t have one!
◾️Despite being sold with full service history I wasn’t supplied with anything documenting this. After a lot of asking I was sent a very faded print out which was barely legible. Printer running out of ink?
I reported the above to the salesman straight away and agreed I’d bring it in the following week to be dealt with, conveniently the salesman was then on holiday the following week which was extremely annoying for me as I was returning to work after mat leave the week after. After months of backwards and forwards emails, Travis went quiet. Having picked up again on this this new year, I have been told Travis has left the company and I was to deal with the manager Adrian Day. Initial call on the phone sounded promising, we agreed I’d bring the car in the following week, for a new windscreen fitting and to deal with other issues. I booked a day off and set off on my long drive up the M4, calling the dealership on my way to check the plan. Only to be told Adrian was off- maybe- they weren’t too sure. Promised a phone call back which never happened. Mighty annoying.
I’m still chasing Adrian now, he believe it or not has even worse customer service skills than Travis. He’s asked me to claim the windscreen on my insurance and they’ll reimburse me my excess, but as I’m still £90 out of pocket for the flat tyre 6months ago I’m not banking on it. He also tells me they can’t do anything about the lack of CD player the car was advertised with!! No explanation why so far. The amount of time I have wasted on this is ridiculous. I went to a main dealership to buy a used car for good customer service and after sales and avoid bad service like everything described above. Sort it out Adrian I’ve waited long enough!!!!!!"

Visited Mercedes later that day and the service was second to none and I'm sure they were happy with my 45k order. Can't wait to pick up my new GLC. So disappointed with the whole BMW experience 👎

2020-02-24,2,"Purchased a Vauxhall Corsa from Inchcape Shrewbury, initial sales over the telephone / internet was good, video sent and car looked in very good condition. Travelled a distance via train to collect the car, all was going well and was picked up kindly by the garage. Then when I arrived the car was not in a satisfactory condition, drivers front tyre bald, how it passed its MOT god only knows. Outside front of car very dirty, obviously been missed or rushed. The car had been valeted inside to a very high standard. Odd stone chips here and there, but overall in very good condition.

This is where my main problem lies, after much discussion the garage agreed to replace the bald tyre and rectify the cleaning of the car, which they did. They made we wait round all day for the tyre to come in, why would you not go and get the tyre from another garage or supplier, why make a customer wait around all day in Shrewsbury?

Eventually the car was ready around 3.30PM after arriving at 10am. To be honest no explanantion why they made we wait in Shrewsbury for nearly 6 hours, no real excuse really because if you have been to Inchcape Shrewsbury its surrounded by many different car dealerships and garages. I can only imagine it was due to the faults I picked up on, so lets make him wait an eternity when really I should have been treated with some sympathy considering the distance I had travelled to find the car in a unsatisfacory condition.

Would I have treated a customer like that who was paying nearly £7000, no way, but you live and learn.

Plus nearly a month on we are still waiting on the follow up call to see if everything is o.k. with the car as promised by the car salesman, would i recommend this garage on my experience probably not.

I have tried to be fair somethings they did well and other things they did very poorly. My advise treat your customers with more respect when you have failed them when they are they are paying you a significant amount of money to purchase a car.

I wanted to mark the garage 2.5 stars, but this is not an option."
2020-02-20,5,"I purchased a new pre-reg BMW-X1 at the end of January, from Coopers Sunderland, the dealership
couldn't be more helpful, my sale advisor Craig Hunter was so amazing, we travelled down from Stirlingshire with 2x cars to trade and pick up our new X1,we were treated with professional and informed mannerism throughout.
The price we paid for our new car was,well worth the travel and the overnight stay at a nearby hotel.
Making our weekend even more enjoyable.
We must thank Coopers, from the girls at reception, sales advisor's, and management for all their help.
Kind Regards,

2020-02-19,5,I needed some help with a rare Toyota Hiace headlamp unit. Jessica Clark at Basingstoke went above and beyond in helpfulness and was an absolute pleasure to talk with. I could not have been more pleased with the friendly and professional Inchcape service I received!

2020-02-14,4,"Unfortunately we had a few sales advisors throughout the purchase process and hadn't been advised that we could track the progress of our vehicle through My Toyota, so feel a wee bit more communication would have been helpful and would have saved us calling the dealership. Obviously you can't help staff leaving, we fully understand that. We also raised the question as to why there could not be the offer of added lumbar support for a passenger and was speedily contacted by customer services and the dealership who said they would send through as a customer feedback to head office"

2020-02-09,5,I bought my car from Inchcape Volkswagen Chester. Ben was extremely helpful and friendly. Best service I have had from a dealer. Worth travelling nearly 140 miles to pick up the car. My brother had bought from Ben before which I didn't realise straight away and he too said Ben was really good. Really happy with the deal that I got and we will consider coming to this dealer again when we need a new car for my husband. Thanks very much for all your help!!
2020-02-07,5,kept informed throughout... Damian was excellent in answering my numerous questions around servicing and contract and sorting things for me. waited in comfortable surroundings. the best thing is the video sent on email talking you through the actual service and giving you facts and figures to keep. extremely impressed
2020-02-06,5,"Volkswagen Inchcape Stockport - Kurt has dealt with me professionally, efficiently and always with a smile and with great understanding of my personal needs. Amazing customer service - he kept me informed from the moment we chose a vehicle to the moment we drove of the forecourt. The man is a credit to the company and is likely the reason we will be back and recommending to friends and family. I hope he gets to see this as he deserves all the recognition. Thank you."
2020-02-05,1,"I have been trying to buy a car, pen poised over chequebook. To sell me a car would be like shooting fish in a barre, both myself and my wife already own VW's. I have spoken to three salesmen. I rang the first And said I would be within him in 10 minutes and when I got there he has gone. I responded to company emails offering 48 hour test drives, nothing happened. I made an appointment for a test drive whichmgot cancelled. He then went on holiday and told me he could pass on my details to a colleague but I heard nothing. I contacted second salesmen who nver returned calls, so I went onto third salesmen who organised 30 min test drive but when I returned not interested in talking me through buying one. Recently responded to an email about a sales event this weekend. Fourth time lucky? Maybe not because no appointment yet received."
2020-02-03,5,"Excellent service and brilliant product.
The salesman Rick couldnt have been more helpful and there was no hard sell, which i always worry about. Our budget was listened to and we ended up getting a better car than we thought possible.

I would recommend highly"

2020-02-03,2,"I challenged the original quote I was given for some work, and it was immediately dropped by around 20%. Why couldn't this 'best price' have been offered from the start, it doesn't fill me with confidence. I was told a piece of unexpected work needed doing, but given no explanation why, even when asking - I just have to hope this was truthful and the work actually needed doing. Given my experience with the price change mentioned earlier, I can't help but feel doubtful. I also asked to be emailed the final price for the work that needed doing, which ended up being £99 more expensive as a diagnosis fee hadn't been added. I have had to spend over £2.5k on the car in the last month and can't help but feel I have been overcharged and maybe for work that didn't need doing."
2020-02-03,1,If there was the option to award 0 stars I would - after sales is appalling. We purchased a vehicle from InchCape Toyota Sandhurst a couple of weeks ago and there are a couple of issues with it. We have contacted the dealership numerous times by email and phone and not been able to get through to the person we dealt with. I was also provided with the direct number of the person we were dealing with and he has been unresponsive. AVOID THIS DEALER!

2020-02-02,2,"Well that's a first, charged for fuel a dealership put in the car two months prior to my purchase, fuel I was informed afterwards was put in the car in order for there to be enough for test drives and the purchaser to drive away in, also an unexplained set of miles done in the car from fuelling to then being put on the forecourt. So, thank you for letting me pay for the portion of fuel your company used and I and others used on test drives prior to my purchase, thank you for a non advertised charge for the fuel in the car in addition to the purchase price. It's the little things that make a purchase, it's the little things that can also leave a sour taste, Inchcape Mini Teesside. Foolish me for signing before clarifying and taking the keys. That's my honest experience and review. Quality car, be prepared for the fuel charge."
2020-02-02,5,"Just visited Jaguar Chester to test drive the new i-pace with Jana Belickova.
What a fantastic car, we were blown away.....but more importantly we were very impressed with Jana‘s refreshingly non pushy sales approach, her honesty and knowledge of the car. Hopefully if the deal figures add up we will see Jana again soon!"

2020-01-31,4,"Returned my car for a warranty repair as the red laquer was peeling on the roof and boot. Inchcape dealt with the whole claim and over £2000 of respray was completed after around 10 days.
I returned the car as one door stands out as being more orange than the surrounding panels.
They inspected the car and agreed (and also pointed out a difference between the boot and wing), but are unwilling to rectify the problem.
Every panel on the car when it went in matched perfectly. Now it does not and they will not remedy the problem. They stated a solution of between £600-£700 to blend the panels.

EDIT Update - resolved satisfactorily, but after many difficulties."
2020-01-31,3,"The good news is that the initial fault I reported was rectified under warranty and the staff were professional and courteous. However, the car was returned to me dirty, with damage caused to the rear bumper. It was not recorded on the drop off sheet, but accepted by the dealer to be rectified. Not a pleasant experience, but ultimately corrected. Thank you."
2020-01-30,1,"I bought an electric Audi from Inchcape in Stockport , the car has been in and out of the garage for the last 4 months ; gave the dealership a notice to refund my money within 30 days from purchase ; they are not interested, great customer service !!"
2020-01-30,1,"Norwich inscape Land Rover Stay clear they really don’t care once they’ve had your money for your car and you have a problem they’re really not interested
Takes two months to book your car in to have it fixed which l was told that you will be given a courtesy car The day before you are due to drop your car off they will call you and tell you there are no courtesy car is available
Also had a problem with the touchscreen with it overheating still not fixed and they say they won’t fix it until either burns out or stopped working altogether even though their own mechanics were shocked at the temperature it got to
Now have a problem with the door locks it will not lock itself all the time and I’ve had to wait two months for this
Every time I have to go to this garage it takes me an hour to get there an hour to get home and the problems are never really sorted"
2020-01-30,1,"the Southampton rover dealership. Refused to give a refund after not providing the service they agreed to.. after ordering a key which they said must be pre-ordered. They failed to get the car in question booked in within the timescale agreed. The key was cancelled by phone call. And then miraculously they know nothing about it. For the sake of £130.and the attitude. "" it's not our policy to give refunds"" They seem prepared to lose their good name. I would advise anyone to use any other rover dealer other than inchcrape. The customer care is atrocious. If I ran my business like this I wouldn't have any customers left."
2020-01-28,1,"I bought a 2 year old car from this dealership and within 3 months it had 4 things wrong with it! All issues that should have been checked/fixed before I bought it. After sales care from this Dealership was non-existent, they simply didn’t want to know. The bill for the repairs has just cost me £700!!! Pre-sales “checks” carried out in May, car purchased in September-4 months later! not what I would have expected from a premium brand, and will certainly never revisit or recommend this dealership to anyone"
2020-01-28,1,"Absolutely awful experience with this dealership - to start with our salesman seemed really helpful and pleasant - right up until I drove my car away. I have found several problems with my car which the dealership are refusing to fix simply because 'well it passed the MOT'. This is not good enough - you do not expect that kind of treatment from a Volkswagen place. I was told by them that my local VW authorised garage (who checked my car after purchasing) tried to pick up on problems to get more money … this is extremely unprofessional and proves how inconsistent Volkswagen are. Read other reviews before you decide to visit this particular dealership. I would avoid at all costs. I hope they hire in new people who have a basic understanding of customer service and a basic understanding of what is expected from an authorised VW garage. Clearly this is not understood here...

My car needs both rear tyres replacing, the spare key is broken, the brake pads and discs need replacing and the rear window heater is broken. And I purchased this with faith that VW would not sell a car in this state. I was clearly wrong! They expect you to bring an independent mechanic to spend a day checking the car over because they apparently only check for what is legal in their so called 142 point check. Everything in the car could be broken yet still legal??? Really good service, cheers guys!!!!"
2020-01-27,5,very helpfull
2020-01-25,5,"We bought our car from Inchcape Volkswagen in June last year. The sales service from start to finish was excellent. There were delays with Volkswagen registering the car, but the dealership were excellent at keeping me updated and had the car ready for me as soon as Volkswagen had sorted it out. Big thanks to James.

We recently had a warning light on, Inchcape checked it out and realised there was a problem. They fixed it under warranty with no issues. Again there were delays with Volkswagen sending the part, but the service team kept us updated every step of the way. Big thanks to Lauren. Once the part arrived the car was fixed and checked over. It was sparkling clean when we got it back too. Absolutely brilliant service. We wouldn’t go anywhere else now."

2020-01-23,2,Your expectations of Approved Used Minis may be disappointed. Before you decide to buy from this or any other main dealership I suggest you ask to see the full results from the pre-sales inspection. The car I bought was 18 months old and low mileage (7800 miles) yet had front brake pads worn down to just 5mm. Mini service recommends changing pads at 4mm. Despite complaints to the dealership and Mini UK there is no acceptance that this is unacceptable and the 50% goodwill discount offered for replacement brake pads is still more expensive than a comparable independent garage.
2020-01-22,1,"Put a deposit down for a used approved car (LH63ACO) which turns up not to have a FSH. No apology for the wasted day trip from Cambridge.... Car is still being advertised on multiple sites as a used approved, despite dealer stating it no longer qualifies. I've notified BMW UK, as the sale manager at Cobham is uninterested in returning my calls. The sales chap I had the misfortune to deal with was rude from the moment we arrived, and thought it appropriate to reminded me on several occasions how they don't normally sell cars of that age, and to ask me not to come to collect the vehicle when he's likely to be busy with other customers..... Needless to say, I walked away from the deal, god knows what other secrets that car might hide"

2020-01-17,5,"I purchased a new vehicle 69 plate from another manufacturer and quickly realised that it was not the one for me. Having previously had a Landrover Evoque I decided to visit the Chester branch and was welcomed by Greg. He talked me through the options available and managed to find me a vehicle in stock. Greg entered into polite conversation whilst maintaining a professional image for Landrover. Greg kept me updated throughout and the whole process was smooth and efficient. The unveiling of the vehicle came as a complete surprise and a lovely personal touch. The dealership looked well presented and exceptionally clean. The coffee machine was well used during negotiations too! The experience in your Landrover showroom was second to none, especially compared with my previous vehicle purchase elsewhere only weeks earlier. Thank you to Greg and the team behind the scenes that support the front of house staff. I'm sure I will be returning in the future."
2020-01-14,1,One star is too much. Preston Inchcape. Terrible customer service for a so called prestige brand. Land Rover you should be disappointed with these as a supplier
2020-01-14,1,"Awful, awful, awful. Purchased a car from West London Volkswagen. Which I now see Inchape no longer operate, sold to Citygate.
On handover I complained about condition of car paintwork it looked awful. There were scratches in the paintwork on the roof and wing mirrors not present when I viewed the car originally. Salesman said he would book it in to get scratches polished out. Had to drive my new car home completely dissatisfied. On the way home tyre pressure warning light came on both front tyres had been replaced. When I complained I was told technician would have inflated to correct pressure, so why were they 26 & 27psi when they should have been 36psi? When car returned a week later for paintwork to be Re polished, tyres checked and valves found to be faulty!! No apology, I sat in the showroom all day waiting for work to be done on handover in fading light in the rain I was expected to accept car. They salesman thought the paintwork was excellent! The following day in daylight the scratches were still present. I took the car to a local approved VW body shop how advised the scratches were through the lacquer and would not polish out. The only way was to re spray the parts of the car. The quote was forwarded to West London VW who disputed the findings to the point I was accused of lying. A representative came and viewed the car and stated the scratches present would be classed as normal for a car of just only 3 years old!. I was offered £500 to get the car polished, but what was the point when an approved VW body shop advised the scratches wouldn’t polish out. These SCRATCHES were not present when I originally viewed the car if they had been I would not have purchased the car. The whole experience has been awful and I am now left with a car I don’t want and West London VW staff didn’t want to help resolve the issue. It all points to staff not interested in there customers and only interested in sales targets. So Inchape what do you now suggest as your franchise is no longer in business and there is still an issue..

Thank you for your reply you certainly know how to tread you customers!!!! A real customer focused company!!! Awful"
2020-01-13,5,"My wife and I recently helped our daughter pick out her first car and visited Inchcape VW in Marsh Barton, Exeter. The salesman we dealt with was Dan Smith. Dan was so helpful and friendly, he went out of his way to make the whole experience a real pleasure. His whole manner was just so professional and we were very impressed, so much so we are planning to get ourselves a new VW and we will be making sure we deal with Dan. We would recommend Inchcape to everyone, especially if you can be dealt with by Dan Smith."
2020-01-11,1,"Agggressive staff member at Ichcape Toyota Oxford, when I queried an error by service dept. The service dept fixed their mistake but Toyota gave no compensation for wasted time, wasted journeys and hassle. I'm a nurse in the NHS and if any staff were aggressive like that then they would be suspended while investigated. The aggressive staff member was still selling cars when I went back for repairs. Cursory reply on Toyota's website. Feels as though they value their own success over the customer. Out of pocket, down on time and subjected to aggression in front of my kids. Very difficult experience."
2020-01-10,1,"In August last year I asked Inchcape Derby to repair my Freelander. It had been with another, very well respected garage (Borrowash Service Garage) who had not been able to find the fault. Realising that the car needed the expertise and specialist diagnostic assistance of a Landrover dealer, the Borrowash garage referred me to Inchcape. Borrowash said that if Inchcape found anything wrong with their work, they would re-do it under warranty. On 28 August I took the car to Inchcape. I explained the situation, and asked them to call the Borrowash garage, and find out exactly what work had been done. They didn’t. They started from scratch and, unknown to me, duplicated Borrowash’s work and charged me for it. The work took ages, and Inchape did reduce their charges because of the delay. But they had not fixed the fault. The fault recurred again within a day or two. I took the car back to Inchcape. This pattern repeated itself again and again over four and a half months. Each time the car went back, it took Inchcape weeks to do anything with the car and, when they did, the fix did not work. At the end of November, I took the car home and again the fault recurred within a day or so. When I asked to return the car, Inchcape said that they could work on it in January but not before – take it or leave it. I complained, so they took the car back – and left it in their car park, doing no work at all on it. Eventually, after I had chased and chased, they said that they had identified the fault but wanted another £481 to fix it. I agreed but said that I wanted the earlier charges refunded. A manager was supposed to phone me back that day. He didn’t. A few days later Inchcape phoned and said that they had made a mistake, and that the fix costing £481 was not worth doing because it would not work. By now it was close to Christmas. I had already had to hire a car on days when I could not do without one. I had to hire one over Christmas. I warned Inchcape every time this happened, to give them a chance to give me a loan car. I did have a loan car for the first few weeks but not after that. When I asked why no car was available, I was told that many of their courtesy cars were on long term loan. If that is true, there must be lots of dissatisfied customers like me, whose cars have been in Inchcape’s clutches for weeks or months. In the end, Inchcape offered to buy my car in part exchange for another. I agreed, subject to agreeing a price, because there was a very specific car that I wanted, and the Inchcape group had one. Inchcape Derby reserved it – and then sold it to someone else. They offered £5,650 for my car (saying, unbelievably, that they would not take money off for the final month’s depreciation – when the car had been in their possession, doing nothing, for over four months) in part exchange, while admitting that they had no suitable car to offer in exchange. When I said I would take cash instead, the offer price went down to £4,500. I am taking my car away from them tomorrow. Inchcape have offered some sort of refund of their charges, but no refund of the hire charges that I incurred. I am going to sue them.

They are an appalling company to deal with. They do not care in the slightest about their customers. The phone is often not answered at all. When it is, it is usually impossible to speak to anyone who can help. You are told repeatedly that someone will call you back. That almost never happens. It is impossible to speak to the dealership manager. He never accepts a call, and never calls back. I would suggest that anyone wanting repair work goes anywhere else on the planet. The service elsewhere might be better, and it could not possibly be worse.

I wish that I had read other online reviews before I agreed to take my car there."
2020-01-10,1,"easy and straight forward booking, part was ordered and repair carried out successfully. car was supposed to have been washed but was not washed at all, the front of car had been jet washed number plate had been jet washed and 2 letters came loose and plate had come unstuck as well on 4D number plate. nothing was mentioned. really disappointed, because apart from this would have been 5 star review."

2020-01-05,1,Bought a VW Golf GTI ex demonstrator from Swindon Inchcape VW drove 4 miles tyre pressure indicator shows puncture pulled into service station to check pressure low so pumped up and rang dealer to find out how to clear pressure indicator alarm. This kept happening eventually took car to another VW dealer for service they found nail in tyre which cost £150 to replace. Rang Swindon as nail must have been in there on delivery they denied it and then discovered on pre delivery form the technician had highlighted the nail in tyre and they had let me take it away regardless. Shoddy lazy and dishonest when confronted with the facts. Wrote to guy in charge in early Nov now Jan heard nothing... jokers
2020-01-04,5,"Many thanks to Rob and Alex. My experience here was fantastic, i felt very welcomed, not rushed into making a decision, they explained everything there was to explain regarding my finance contract.
Really happy with the choice i made. the car i bought is fantastic."
2019-12-31,1,"Put my Jag in for a warranty piece of work - the indicator stalk was turning on the main beam when I turned right - it was an intermittent fault and I explained it was. Got the car back after 1.5 days (had to order parts - no problem there). Turns out despite telling me the work would be done, it wasn’t and the excuse was “we couldn’t find the fault - no fault codes”. This kind of intermittent fault probably won’t generate a code and I explained I thought the stalk itself was faulty. Whenever I spoke to Amy at York, all she could do was “check and get back to me” so I spent time on hold. I was also told the stalk would be fixed and it wasn’t. My car now intermittently turns on high beam and is dangerous to other drivers."
2019-12-31,5,"We never had any dealings with either Volkswagen or Inchcape VW Telford prior to this.
My son was looking for a newer car and we headed off to Inchcape to see what was on offer. As soon as we arrived we were impressed by the size of the place and the number of quality used cars that were available. While browsing the vehicles on offer we were approached by Rajbir who spent a load of time with us discussing the type of car and deal my son wanted. Having a good idea now what we wanted Rajbir took us all inside the clean and airy showroom where tea and coffee was offered.
Never at any time did we find the staff pushy or too sales orientated, we genuinely felt we were really important and our satisfaction came first.
Rajbir spent a great deal of time and effort getting us the exact match for my son, and then Shaz the business manager helped us through the finance options to again find the best deal for our son.
We bought an almost new car and we still didn't feel pressurised, in fact we left feeling we had made new friends. Not only were the VW terms and warranties excellent, they also give you a 30 money back guarantee so if your not happy you can take the car back!
Raj and Shaz, thank you for excellent service, we have your personal numbers and our next car is coming from you guys too!
A real credit to their company, thank you.

In addition to the above review, I got a slow puncture in a tyre and when I attempted to take off the wheel I found out that the key for the security stud had been stripped and I Couldn't remove the wheel for repair. I Contacted the Telford garage and they took my car in immediately, removed all 4 security bolts for me and replaced them completely free of charge within 30 minutes. Now thats service! I honestly can't recommend this garage and staff highly enough!"
2019-12-28,1,"Purchase a Used Mercedes from Swindon Audi this year. Was told it would come with a “Approved used Warranty”. Few months on we had a roof fault whereby it would not operate. Got it in to Mercedes also part of the Inchcape group to be told no Inchcape warranty had been register on the car! After speaking to Swindon Audi they advised there had been an error and they would get the warranty registered so the work could be done. We are now nearly Two Months on from when it went into mercedes with the fault and we still have NO Warranty on the car! After spending weeks chasing Audi Swindon, CEO of Inchcape group and other parties Mercedes eventually just did the work and gave the car back. However we were refused a courtesy car and it meant my grandma could not get around for over 3 weeks! Not only that but affected her opening her shop and business. I have advised Audi Swindon along with the UK retail team and CEO of which no one has replied or taken ownership to be compensated or to have this warranty registered so it can be used in the future and mercedes can be paid for the work. At the time of purchase my local Mercedes garage and Audi Swindon both fought over the car sale which was very un professional. Mercedes advised any used car in the Inchcape stock should be moved to the correct dealer For example a mercedes to mercedes Inchcape and an Audi to an Audi Inchcape dealership. It’s very clear that the Inchcape group are happy to sell you a Car but not interested in after sales. Reply below from Inchcape says thanks for your comments?! Clearly haven’t taken the time to read and understand the above. The car still has no warranty registered so this is not resolved and no one has taken ownership!"
2019-12-19,5,I was very impressed with Olivia in the Service Department at Chelmsford BMW. She was extremely curtious and helpful and soon had me back on the road again. As a consequence I have booked my car in for other maintenance work even though my nearest dealer is Colchester BMW. Well done.

2019-12-16,1,"Do not buy a car! ⛔️

If you expect any level of after care or help with anything once you’ve bought a car do not use this dealer. I’d bought a car in October 2018 and been told several things that were either untrue or then added to my agreement when I was told they would be free. To make things even worse the staff who have dealt with my complaint at Inchapes head office have been extremely poor Emma and Victoria have fabricated several pieces of information that they can in no way back up with any paperwork or call recordings. To be told I had a payment taken on the day of purchase for the deposit. To then check and it was taken 3 days later! I was told on the 2nd October that I’d get a response after my SARS request was processed and this again showed the lack of care from head office for a customer as conversations I’d had were not noted on my account either so they clearly had no intention of dealing with it professionally. That shows in the fact things have been missed in the final response from them. How did they store my card details so be careful when giving them personal information. I was told this was due to me cancelling my order and then placing it again within 3 days but yet they only have a cancelled order to show this on their system but no correspondence from myself. I have been told Guardx was applied to the car but never received a warranty document or an actual pack so make sure they don’t try and scam you out of that money as well! All in all it’s been a terrible experience with a brand you would expect a lot better from. I’ll make sure to never give them any business in the future and I’d hope you’d make sure to read the reviews on this page about the service others have received which is something I wish I’d done. I’d have never have purchased the car if this was going to be how I was treat as a customer to basically feel like you’re business or custom isn’t wanted once they have your money. They don’t keep records of anything which is shown in the information which I have received from them on my account and don’t really seem to care about that fact either just simply saying it’s an oversight or it isn’t something they can see or prove as they don’t keep records of anything up to date. They also let employees use personal devices to contact you which again they have no control or record of any dealings with them via those methods so why allow it?

All in all a very bad experience and not something I’ll be leaving at the poor final response letter I have received I’ll be calling up the finance company in the morning to male sure they’re aware how incompetent the people are who are selling there product at keeping basic information either secure or up to date. Don’t expect a response of any kind either just some generic rubbish to make it look like they’re doing something about bad reviews!"

Picked car up and discs not changed note on work sheet “couldn’t contact customer” – lie no1. No apology must have been my fault!
Identified two oil leaks car booked in for day.

2. Returned car for a further day, Picked car up only one oil leak fixed other wrongly identified need to rebook car in again! No apology must have been my fault again!

3. Brought car in again for oil leak and brake fluid change, notified at 2.30pm car not started and won’t be completed today, asked to speak to manager after service advisor took Umbridge to me asking to speak to somebody important (definitely my fault) no response.
Later rang to speak to service advisor said they would return my call didn’t lie no2

Service guy then said actually the oil sprayed out whilst removing sump plug, probably Lie no4.
Given tin of brake cleaner to clean my drive, at my hourly consultancy rate of £108 I believe you have some amendment to make on my invoice. For all the inconvenience, time wasted, my cleaning duties and poor customer service.

At this point service manager offered me £250 for my inconvenience, which I reluctantly accepted.

Arrive at showroom to be told car will be about 15 mins. Then 30mins later told just completing then 1hour later I asked if I could be truthfully told what was happening with my car at which the service desk staff took Umbridge to me showing my pent up displeasure (purely factual not aggressive or rude), one actually stated he didn’t want to hear it.
At this point the service manager intervened and gave a list of excuses why their service was so bad.
I suggested I would probably be using the independent BMW service centre locally in future and his response was “ it hurts me to say but you will probably receive better service”
Please don’t be swayed by this review form your own opinion.
Also strange I have not been asked to submit a review.

2019-12-10,1,"Genuinely the worst customer experience of my life at Cooper Croydon (part of Inchcape PLC). The full list of failures is too long so I'll summarise:
- Purchased a used BMW (less than 18 months old)
- All fine up until I parted with my cash...then it quickly went downhill
- Noticed a transmission fault within a week of driving it
- Took the car in for repair. They told me they had done a transmission reset. Absolutely nothing had changed
- I asked for a refund or exchange. They said no, and that I was legally obliged to give them a second chance to repair the fault before they would consider this (this is completely untrue under the Consumer Right Act)
- I gave them that chance. After a few days, they told me they replaced a faulty component. Same problems persisted almost immediately.
- Asked again for a refund or exchange. They agreed to an exchange.
- Spent 2 weeks going back and forth with sales looking at different options. Agreed on one, which they promised to order for me.
- After agreeing this, was told a week later that they are no longer willing to replace the car and only willing to repair it (contrary to my statutory rights) with absolutely no explanation or apology
- All this on top of over 50 calls (they never pick up) and 30 emails (they never respond) to try and get it resolved

I've been forced to raise a legal dispute to get my money back.

Seriously, save your time, money and sanity and go somewhere else. It's not worth it."
2019-12-09,1,"The worst customer service I have ever received: Chester Land Rover.

I am adding a review in addition to my husbands overall review, as this one is specific to my experience and my vehicle.

We have two Range Rover’s, purchased from Land Rover in Chester and we have had nothing but poor service from start to finish. I wish I had trusted my intuition and never bought from them as it grieves me to pay a premium price for terrible service.

Now, as a person who considers themselves fair, I have loved my vehicle even with the ongoing issues and faults. However, some of the faults reported to Land Rover have not been dealt with or repaired over the last three years, such as the continued sluggish gears when pulling off from stationary, in fact, the engineer at my most recent visit (last week) told me all engines and gear boxes will be slightly different and will respond differently, some being slower than others. You see, we have two identical 2016 Range Rover Evokes with the same engine etc., so I know that my car is much less responsive when compared to the other. It is just baffling to hear that this fault can’t be repaired (after multiple visits) and we just have to accept that one of our two identical cars will only be identical If you ignore the differences with the way it drives and responds. I don’t ever remember being told to test drive several identical specification vehicles as it’s a roulette as to which one drives best?

What’s more, my vehicle has had ongoing issues with tyres deflating due to what a tyre fitter at a different garage suggests is due to warping of the alloy wheel paint, which impacts on the tyre fit. I am still waiting for a phone call from June 2019 to rectify this, given I am covered for this to be rectified. I have raised this again at a recent visit, but unsurprisingly, I’m waiting for that call again.. In fact, there is a common issue and culture (in my opinion) at Land Rover which annoys me the most, that’s the promise of a call back, but one never seems to materialise. You get promised all sorts on the phone, “We will call you back later today”.. but it simply never happens! Please, stop promising to deliver something if you cannot action it, integrity and honesty should be your foundations as if you can’t deliver these fundamentals, your business is flawed and you expose yourselves as what can only be described as compulsive liars, who try to ‘blag’, rather than being open and honest. I realise all staff are genuinely nice people, who most certainly do not intent to be deceitful, but in my opinion, there is clearly a culture here which promotes ‘blagging’ at any cost. Customers are intuitive beings who often know when they are being lied to, please review this inherent culture and simply be honest and manage expectation, you will get far more respect in return.

Also, in addition to the above, I have found the servicing to be poor, often waiting in excess of the agreed one day, for the car to be returned. While I understand there are times where a car will need extra time in the garage, this tends to be a common experience, often leaving the car for days when it was originally agreed to be a ‘day case’.

I would never buy from Chester Land Rover again and can only hope this poor experience is limited to the Chester branch. I do hope that this British Brand pulls it’s socks up and starts acting more professionally. While I am only a small fish in your very large pool, It is a real shame to have such a distaste and lack of compulsion to buy again from Land Rover."
2019-12-08,1,"Range Rover INCHCAPE Chester

What can I say about the terrible service that this garage offers. It goes from bad to worse to terrible.

Booked my two Range Rover Evoques into the garage for a service. Cars are only just 3 years old. Couldn't offer me a car to use, but happy enough as I have two cars.

CAR ONE

First one booked in Tuesday. Arrived 8am and told would be ready at the end of the day. About 4pm heard nothing, so thought I better telephone, after leaving 4 messages to be phoned back, I telephoned a 5th time, saying that the car definitely wouldn't be ready, and the woman on the phone said why would it be! I was told to phone the next day about dinnertime. Phoned Wednesday at the time specified, again this time only left three messages. I get a phone call at 5pm, saying your car won't be ready. Thursday I get a phone call saying that the car needs replacing at a cost of £1200. The part that has been rattling for the last 3 visits to the garage, but now its out of warranty they want me to pay for it. The car has now been with them 3 days until they find the problem. The fourth day, Friday I get a phone call to say the car is ready. Arrive at the garage at 5pm and wait until 6:30pm whilst they 'get the car'. I didn't end up paying the £1200 as on the car records it stated I have been in with the same problem during the last 3 visits.

CAR TWO

Thinking it cant get any worse, I leave my second car at the time I dropped the first, thinking it will be ready for the service booked for Monday. Monday about 4pm I call the garage. Left 3 messages to be called back. No response. Fourth call, m I am told that the software update on the car is taking longer than planned. Will need to keep the car overnight. I explained that I need the car for a trip to Cardiff and London this week. ""I cant help you there, you collect your car and rebook"", thinking they already have my car, I make alternative arrangements (pay for train tickets!). Tuesday (day 2), no call all day, I telephone at 4pm, I was told they were about to phone me, telling me the car won't be ready due to a software update. Wednesday (day 3) Hear nothing all day. Thursday 9day 4) told that the car is having a software update...the software update has now been going on for 3 day (dial up internet I feel rather than fibre broadband). Friday (day 5), a phone call to say that the car is ready.Told that I won't be able to collect, but can the car be dropped off. ""Yes"" I was told ""at your home?"". I thought brilliant. No car Friday delivered, No car on Saturday delivered, No car on Sunday delivered. Its Monday tomorrow and Land Rover Chester has now had my second car for 10 days for a service.

I asked the representative for the Service Manager and General manager to call me. Guess what...still waiting.

This is the worse service from any garage I have ever attended in my whole life. I would never recommend. I will never buy a Land Rover again. They are very happy to take your money when buying a car but not happy when you need a car serving and after sales.

Not one car but two cars.

New garage built, but the most horrible customer service I have ever received from any shop, hotel, staff member.

Terrible, horrific service, rude staff.

You have lost me forever!"
2019-12-05,1,"Inchcape Land Rover Guildford have continuously let me down, time after time. Paint issues on a Range Rover they were very reluctant to fix but eventually did at a Ford dealership!! Then they sold me a car which conked out before I got it home and said it needed a new engine (I rejected the car and they reluctantly refunded me - but didn’t compensate me for my time and made no effort to source a different car, it was my problem and that was that).
They do not care about customers one iota. The most recent issue is with a Disco 4 I bought which is under LR used car warranty. The car has a suspension and brake fault yet they refused to see the car for another 5 weeks - or 7 weeks if I want a courtesy car! Appalling. They expect my pregnant wife to drive around in a dangerous car - which she now cannot get in or out of because the suspension is too high and basically said if I want it to be seen sooner I should call another garage!!
I wouldn’t expect this awful experience with much cheaper brands, never mind from what is supposed to be a premium brand. It really puts me off buying another JLR product; they’re unreliable and the service does not overcome the product issues adequately.
This is very disappointing Inchcape, once again.
You have lost me as a customer for life."
2019-12-03,1,"We were told our car purchase of £30,000 included two free services which the company are refusing to honour. The salesman Adam Pile did not record the details on the system and only gave us a hand written record of the service deal, which Inchape claim is not valid. Result £800 extra servicing costs.

They are liars and will promise anything to get the deal, be warned they are your typical sleazy used car company. Avoid."
2019-12-03,5,"I am on my tenth Jag all bought from whoever has been the Jag Main Dealer in Preston. When you moved everything to Bluebell Way on the outskirts of Preston my initial experience was not good and I commented as such on here. I then added an update that things were improving and I was in process of buying that 10th Jag. Yesterday I took it into Preston for its first service and was delighted to find that the 'Jaguar Experience' that has kept me loyal to Jaguar all these years is very much 'alive and well' at Preston. As soon as I arrived a young lady (Hannah) introduced herself and took me through the paper work, provided me with a coffee, and as I was waiting for my car she found me a comfortable place to do some work I had brought with me. Throughout the time I was waiting Hannah kept checking on my requirements and provided updates as to time scale etc. Once car was ready I was taken to it rather than just given my keys and left to find my car. It was good to once again leave your facility feeling that I am a valued customer."

Very disappointed with dealership and will not be returning."
2019-11-29,5,Excellent customer service from start to finish this dealership always looks after me no complaints from me this is also my 3rd Volkswagen
2019-11-28,1,"After my car developed a fault recently, my usual mechanic advised me that it would be a good idea to get the local VW dealer (in Telford) take a look to identify the precise part which was causing the problem. I explained this and was told it was £60. This was in line with what my mechanic had said it would cost, so I agreed and booked it in.

Day 1 and they can't reproduce the fault (the AA had cleared the engine's fault log) so couldn't proceed. But, they charged me anyway. So I took the car away and reproduced the problem, and dropped it back in with the warning lamp still flashing. Half an hour later they're on the phone to confirm that there is fault (!) and to inform me that now the real cost begins: an *additional* £99 (why £99?), maybe more, to now actually find out what's wrong. When I queried what the £60 was for, apparently that's just to plug something into the car to confirm the fault. £60, for 5 minutes work, or at least that's how long it took the AA guy to do the same thing. I refused to pay, presumably their business model relies on people just reluctantly agreeing to keep on shelling out. Anyway, we got nowhere and in the end they just returned the car to me.

As a ""good will gesture"" they refunded the £60 (well, let's hope so, I've just seen another review where someone says they never refunded him!).

I'm sure they're ok if you're looking to spend a lot of money with them, but for routine stuff like this then totally avoid."
2019-11-27,1,"Took my car for a service at VW West London in mid-October but then found I had been charged for what was meant to be a 'complimentary' health check (which I hadn't even requested).

Contacted Chris Pearson who I'd been dealing with, to be assured it was a mistake and I'd be refunded. After some days, nothing had appeared in my account so I queried this and was told it was with accounts and so out of his hands.

The end of the month came and went. Still no payment. Emailed Chris again for an update or contact details for the accounts team. No response. Nothing from the VW service desk email either. Contacted the 'tellusmore' Inchcape email address. Got an automated reply but no actual response. Emailed the branch manager. No reply. Tried the livechat facility and was told the branch would call me back urgently but nothing. Went back to livechat after another week and was told their customer complaints team would contact me, but nothing from them either.

Avoid like the plague.

*23RD DECEMBER UPDATE*
Although my original review on here in November suddenly garnered an email response and confirmation of the money I'm owed, I am still yet to receive anything. They apologise but are unable to provide any reason for the delay and don't take any tangible action. Comfortably the worst customer experience I have ever had."
2019-11-26,1,"I will try to complete this as fair as possible.

Good points: Graham Nicklin - helpful in getting the brand new car I wanted, delivering to me, prompt return of calls, regular updates, no hard sell. Delivery guys really friendly and explaining everything to me.
When needing to reject the car for fault - it was picked up quickly and most of my money was returned from VW.

Average points: Bent rear wiper which had to be sent back to garage and replaced. This was done on same day, so it wasn't problematic.

Bad points: Car arrived day later that was planned in discussion with used sales team (given Graham was away) even though I was asked to take delivery day before (taking time off work and waiting around all day for delivery for it not to arrive).

Major fault with car, which I explicitly asked was this particular engine effected by kangaroo issues. I was assured it wasn't, even though the VW network were fully aware of the issues. Either lack of communication between teams or dishonesty - not sure which.

Was told mistakenly that I could not receive a full refund given that I had driven the car (literally nowhere) and also wouldn't receive my service plan back (even though I hadn't used it).

I also figured out that I was charged the higher tax bracket for the car than what I should been charged. After heated discussion and going through VW head office, 4 months later my final refund came through.

The majority of my VW correspondence kept going to the wrong address. This was highlighted several times and was told that it would be rectified. Whatever happened it wasn't rectified and my pensioner neighbours had to keep walking down the road with all of my post containing important documentation.

It was a very stressful, time consuming process and not one I wish other customers to have to face. Im now without a VW Golf and on the look out for a new vehicle.

I assume that when the car is in full working order buyers are happy, but this was very tiresome and upsetting process.

Thank you."

Because we escalated the poor service we received and left a negative review previously for BMW Cooper Croydon.
They emailed us to say - quote see below

Im very sorry I cant work on your vehicle .i have been speaking to service department (management) about it and I cant take this on job.
Please feel free to get the vehicle moved onto another dealership/Bodyshop of your choice .
Again im very sorry about this .

Even BMW UK were shocked to hear of this, we have had our car moved on. Another reason not purchase from this branch as they can't take constructive criticism. A complete lack of professionalism from what is required to fly the BMW flag."
2019-11-22,1,"Paid thousands of pounds for a defective range rover sports sold by Inch Cape Land Rover Derby!
Approximately 9 months ago, I purchased my range rover sports, 65 plate from Inch Cape Land Rover in Derby. (Pride Stadium)
From a month of ownership, it has had numerous oil and filter changes and one DPF change. Constant hazard lights on saying DPF is full (without prior warning that it was nearly full - as it should- and therefore due for a long drive.) ""service required"" light is permanently on.

It has spent more time in the service room than serving us. After 5 and a half months of this, (this is the short version, major dramas -urg!) I rejected the car under the consumers act. I have written 4 formal letters before court action, Inch Cape has ignored me to date.
Upon browsing forums and reviews, it turns out I am not alone and this is a common problem!
There is clearly a latent defect with these models IMHO. I believe that Land Rover were aware of this inherent defect but yet keep selling these cars to unsuspecting customers.
The turbo no longer works, it struggles to reach 40mph and the poor car now drives like a castrated bull! Needless to say, it now languishes on the driveway!

I am in the process of engaging lawyers as they refuse to engage in conversation with me. The shame is that, up until now, I was interested in finding a solution to this amicably as I still like the range. But the love affair is now over.

Has anyone been through this with Land Rover, please share your experience!
I cannot believe a reputable dealer such as Inch Cape Land Rover Derby can treat a customer this way! This is very disappointing. Shame on you Land Rover! Big shame!
If we cannot trust Land Rover, whom we pay a hefty premium to buy directly from, then whom can we trust?"

Awful customer service and shameful ignorance to accept there is a clear problem with XE cars.

I have an 'incorrect diesel fluid quality light detected' light coming on now almost weekly! It's been in for repair twice at Jaguar Inchcape Preston, but failed to be repaired properly and the company will not accept (despite numerous complaints online such as this one) that there is an issue. A simple online search of 'incorrect diesel fluid quality detected' and XE brings up a raft of issues and complaints.

It seems there is a software problem, but Jaguar won't accept that as they simply appear not know how to fix this.

In the meantime, I've been left with a repair bill because Jaguar did not follow my warranty firm's protocol, and went ahead with work before it was approved, leaving me out of pocket.

Now Inchcape Preston have seemingly washed their hands of the problem because I am so exasperated abut having a car whose light comes on regularly, after an extremely terse email reply from their after sales manager. Now they suggest I take the car elsewhere and have pointed me towards an ombudsman.

DO NOT BUY A JAGUAR. I have had two, and I have been a Jaguar driver/customer for more than 7 years now. I wish I had not been so loyal after buying a second. Please do note their response below. They are unable and unwilling to fix this issue.

Totally unprofessional, salesman talking rubbish to reign you in, didn't offer to help or suggest alternates, clearly only interested in the big money deals so unless you have the cash or are male don't bother going to see them.

By the time we left it was after closing time but he still continued to offer us information.
Unfortunely the vehicle didn't quite tick all the boxes for us and so sadly we purchased one from another dealership who just happened to have the right vehicle.

I sent an e-mail to Harald Krüger (Global CEO of BMW), BMW UK Customer Services, and to Inchcape (the company who reply to some of these reviews), but I am unable to post the full complaint as well as their full replies, as there is a character limit on here

The upshot is:

- like other complaints: poor customer service and rude staff

- like other complaints: phone rings and rings and no-one picks up

- staff lie (yes, lie). This a lady called Mica. I wish I could post why this is but there is a character limit on this site

- branch manager (Matthew) is abrupt, rude and patronising. He defends the poor service by his staff

- had a heated exchange with the branch manager. he accused me of swearing to staff (I said ""flipping rubbish service"", for which they interpreted something else)

- manager told me never to go back to the branch (I have booked a new issue with another branch who were easy to get through to)

- staff told me not to believe the bad reviews on Google (that means all of you who are posting reviews are LIARS according to Coppers Croydon)

- you can easily see other customers’ paperwork lying on the desk. Their names, addresses and car make/model were visible. So I now know that Mr B [surname concealed for this review] was a customer at the branch; I could see where he lives and which car he drives. This is an obvious breach of Data Protection / GDPR, and I would be really concerned that my details are visible to other people

- car was not cleaned as they said it would be

- clearly most of the better reviews are from sales which is not a surprise because they are taking money from the customer

E-mail replies from BMW Customer Services:
- Nothing they can do about a branch's behaviour or their decisions except to address issues via training. Bit of a standard response
Extract: ""...On this point I’ve raised your complaint officially here with BMW UK, I’ve also followed that up with the our BMW senior regional managers. Your complaint will be addressed internally in due course.
I’m unable to advise what actions will be taken, only to advise that we expect a high level of customer service which clearly hasn’t been provided in your visit.""

E-mail replies from Inchcape:
Again, a standard response...
Extract: ""...We have looked into the issues you have faced in our dealership here at head office and with the management team on site; we will be using your feedback to assess the training needs of our members of staff and to improve our future services....""

Poor response - waste for time e-mailing Inchcape to be honest

I am writing to you with regards to my treatment from your service department.  I first visited your dealership on 17th July 2019 for a B Service, which was carried out and I collected my car the next day on the 18th July. Everything seemed fine and I drove home and parked the car and did not use it until Saturday 20th July when suddenly the EML came on. I stopped and turned off the engine and re-started and all appeared to clear itself. On Sunday 21st July when I started the car the light came back on again but this time it would not clear itself.  Eventually I called out Mercedes Breakdown, he carried out some checks and suggested I take the car to Warrington, which I did. On Monday 22nd July I called to see when will you be able to check and repair the fault, I was told I should get the car back by the weekend.  
I was without a car all week and desperately needed my car back asap as I use it for work towing my trailer. I was called by Jenna on 23rd July stating that they think they know what the fault is and they will order the parts and carry out the repairs. Jenna also stated that during the health check they found that the brake pipes were corroded and weeping and dangerous and need replacing. I then mentioned that the service B video health check only said the pipes were corroded and need to be monitored.  I then received a call from Jenna on 26th July saying that the car was fixed and ready for collection and it has been washed and vacuumed. I said I will be there tomorrow 27th July around 2 pm to collect. On Saturday I was shown the bill and explained what parts had been changed and so I paid £918.00 before I was even given the opportunity to look at the car. After paying I was given my car keys back and when I sat in the car I started it in order to leave but the EML came on immediately I didn't even put the car in to drive (incidentally the car was not washed or vacuumed).  I returned to reception and spoke to the girl who was dealing with me and explained the light was still on and the fault was not fixed. She said she will speak to someone and went out to the back. After several minutes she returned and said that the car was taken on a 4 mile test drive after the repairs and everything was fine (this is not true as I have photographic evidence of the mileage at the time of drop off and there was no additional mileage).  All she could do was to arrange a loan car and then on Monday have the service department take another look. ( In the loan car was the loan agreement detailing the previous drivers personal details like driver licence number date of birth and his full home address, not good. I handed this form to Paul).
On Monday 29th July I called MB Warrington again to see if they had any answers, was told they will come back to me when they have some answers and Jenna will call me Tuesday. I did not receive any calls from anyone. On Wednesday 31st July I decided to drop in unannounced and asked to speak to the service manager Paul. Paul arrived in reception and I explained that you have had my car since 21st July and nine days later you still have it what's going on? Paul said he will have to go and speak with the service department and go from there, I asked for the initial and final diagnostics showing that the car was fixed on the 27th and all faults were cleared. I was told that I can not have copies but he will look at them himself. He came back with a wad of papers but did not show me the final results but kept saying that they will look in to what the problem is and move on from there. I told Paul that he must not carry out any further repairs without first contacting me for my approval, he agreed and said he will call me Thursday 1st August at 2.30 pm. Paul did call me and said they have found the problem and they are double checking everything and that he will call me back at 16.30 and confirm their findings. Paul did not call me back at 16.30. On 5th August at 17.41 I received a call from Jenna saying that the car is fixed and ready for collection and that all I had to pay was for the part, Paul has waived the labour costs, I told her that Paul and I agreed no to do any repairs without my approval. I arranged to collect the car on Tuesday 6th August at 14.00. When I arrived Paul met me and took me into his office and explained what the problem was and again had a wad of papers saying everything is sorted and he will waive the labour and I just had to pay for the part. By now I am so fed up I just wanted my car and to leave. Paul said he will get Jenna to draw up the invoice and I can leave. After waiting 10 minutes, Jenna arrived with the invoice of £174.65, which I paid again before checking the car, big mistake!!!
After paying I was told she will find John the mechanic and get my key from him. After waiting 10 minutes Jenna was nowhere to be seen and so I asked Jennifer to please chase up my key as I had an appointment in Atherton to price for a job. After another 5 minutes Jenna came back out and told me they can't find my key and the mechanic thinks he has left it in another car he was working on. Jenna then said if I emailed her my drivers licence and V5 she will get a replacement key. I left and thought about the day’s events and the thought occurred to me that someone may have deliberately taken my car key with the registration number on it and that my car could be stolen at any time. I then emailed Paul saying that either he finds my original key and drops my car off immediately or that you must change all the locks and ignition and supply me with two new keys, either way he must come back to me by the end of play Wednesday 6th July, I did not receive any contact from Paul.  
In total I have paid out £1408.07 and I don’t have my car. This is unacceptable and the inconvenience and loss of business this has caused me needs to be addressed.
Finally, I had a loan car delivered to me on Wednesday 7th August. On Thursday 8th August the oil warning light appeared and instructing to add engine oil. I tried calling the service department but could not get through. On Friday 9th August I emailed Paul explaining the problem and asked for him to sort it out. I have had no replies from anyone. I am not a mechanic and so I don’t know what oil is required and I still have to use the car for my work and I will not be held responsible if something happens to the car engine. The car should have been checked before it is loaned out and if someone at MB Warrington pressed a few buttons they would have seen the lack of oil.   
It is 6th November 2019 and I still don't have the reports that have been promised to me from Paul Antrobus (service manager) or from customer services also I have not heard anything from Rebecca Sides (general manager)
 

I look forward to hearing from you soon to discuss in more detail.

 

Kind regards

2019-11-05,4,"Good Service.
Took the car for some parts to be replaced. Was give a curtesy car and my car ready at the time which we asked. Generally it would have been between 4-6pm, but our car was ready at 1.00pm. Friendly service."
2019-11-04,4,"Overall very good, fuss free and was kept updated throughout. However when I booked the car in the member of staff on the phone said it would be washed and vacuumed when I pick it up, however this wasn't the case, hence no five stars."
2019-11-01,5,"Well what can we say ? An absolute pleasure to do business with, from the first contact by phone to driving the car away 3 hours later.
We rang this morning and spoke to Charlie who reserved it for us. When we arrived it was ready for us to test drive.
Our experience with Charlie was exceptional he really did exceed our expectations with his thoroughness. He has a friendly approach without being pushy and did exactly what he said he was going to do and more ! I would definitely recommend Inchcape Nottingham Toyota especially Charlie. Thank you Robert & Jane"
2019-11-01,5,"Excellent service, really felt like they cared about what we wanted"
2019-11-01,1,"The following text was given as feedback to BMW but no-one bothered to contact me.... Salesman told that it did not have a spare tyre or jack kit because it had Run Flat Tyres. Not the case - ordinary tyres are fitted - found out it didn't have RFT's after the purchase. Coms with salesman said that we should visit Ipswich Service Department to discuss - he wouldn't do it on my behalf. Highly dangerous for people believing they could continue to travel with a puncture.

Wheel hub alloy corrosion - told to travel to Ipswich to get them videoed - was told that I couldn't use Colchester BMW as the car was registered in Ipswich. I have photographed them for my own reference.

MOT mileage recorded was less than previous MOT test and no smoke test certificate or record when the MOT test was done by Ipswich. DVSA dealing with this matter.

Did not get coms back from Colchester BMW when enquiring about the car we eventually bought in Ipswich. We received an email from Colchester after we bought the car.

And an extra bit, the car was purchased 21/9/2019 and have found out it will need a service after only having it for 6 weeks - unlikely that BMW will pay for it, otherwise they would have done it before purchase.

Two attachments: one shows corrosion at hub, the other shows the tyre is not a run flat type.

1/11/2019 Update - Inchcape customer services eventually emailed me and said that I had to telephone Cooper Ipswich - that's where I started. I pointed this out to them and they were adamant that this should be my course of action. So nothing resolved, comments and complaints ignored. My advise to prospective customers is to avoid them. I will not be taking any of my, or family's, BMW's for servicing or purchasing spares. I certainly will not buy again from them"
2019-10-28,5,"Helpful, friendly service."
2019-10-26,1,"Case No. 020 674

Saturday 26th October, marks four months since my vehicle has been sitting at Cooper BMW Croydon for diagnostic tests subsequent to the malicious damage done to the vehicle at the now closed Cooper BMW Banstead branch when taken there for a paid service on 1st May 2019. As a previously loyal Cooper BMW client of nearly four years, a period in which not only my vehicle services but also bodywork to the tune of several thousand pounds has been generated for Cooper BMW and parent company, Inchcape UK, I am utterly and completely disgusted by the negligent, incompetent, unprofessional and indifferent manner in which I have been treated. Despite an official complaint, which Emma Walker at Inchcape was supposedly investigating, there has been minimal communication, the majority of which I’ve had to chase. Additionally, there has been not a single attempt by David Jones, Head of Business at Croydon, to contact me although he has allegedly informed Emma Walker that I am being updated regularly.

I am now informing Cooper BMW Croydon and Inchcape UK that I will be seeking legal action against Inchcape CEO, James Brearley, Chairman, Nigel Stein, and Group Chief Executive, Stefan Bomhard, to have my vehicle returned in the condition it was prior to being maliciously damaged at Cooper BMW Banstead, my MOT, which has since expired, to be updated and for financial compensation for the detrimental impact this entire sorry episode has had on my life."
2019-10-26,1,"Brought my car into Mercedes Warrington for some works to be done, booked in from 9 till 4, dropped off at 9, told to come back At 4. I arrived at 4 only to wait an hour before somebody gave me an update on my car. I was told it would be the following day, which was frustrating, and to go home.
The following day I repeatedly called for an update, nothing. I write this with the branch closing in an hour, and still I have no idea the progress of my car.
I can forgive things taking longer, that is the nature of maintenance, but I cannot forgive zero communications to the customer, this service has been absolutely shocking and unforgivable for a company that is supposed one of the best at customer service. I will not be returning for any more services or to buy a car from them."
2019-10-25,2,"Am I just unlucky? I’ve enjoyed great customer service from Lexus Derby since 2012 until February this year when my experience turned unsatisfactory. Two of my most recent company cars (Lexus) were purchased and maintained from Derby and I was very well looked after for 6 years until I came out of my company’s car policy and purchased my own Lexus NX Premier from Lexus Hatfield (who had an example matching my desired spec). I live and work close to Derby so continued using them for servicing etc and set up a service plan. 1st service, no health check video received and oil clearly not changed. This was carried out after I complained. An oil sample was taken for analysis but no outcome was received. More recently, I enquired about SMART repairs after receiving an email offering the service. I enquired 3 times over 2 weeks and did not receive a response. Called again today to be told we don’t actually offer a SMART repair service! This is sadly not the Lexus experience I’m used to!"
2019-10-25,1,replacement car not available when should have been...parts were late coming in....and parking is a disgrace
2019-10-24,1,"Quite possibly the poorest level of customer services from the point of showing interested in a car to after sales, including their complaint handling process.

I done my own HPI on a vehicle I was interested in. It showed outstanding finance. I made the garage aware but they told e it is nothing to worry about. Two weeks later, he day before the car was to be delivered - I receive a call to say the car cannot be delivered as surprise surprise, they is uncleared finance against it. Clearly it was something to worry about and should not have been brushes under the carpet.

One month later, there is an issue with the car that was not previously recognised. I am now told to bring the car back to have it corrected - the dealership is 2 hours away for me.

The Inchcape complaints team have been useful and failed to get back to me. I am now raising a dispute with my credit card company and reported the garage to the Motor Ombudsman.

My suggestions is to avoid Inchape and BMW Reading."
2019-10-23,1,"I was driving my company vehicle and a hazard light appeared on the dashboard. After the AA attended they advised that I should take the car to Inchcape Jaguar Chester. Whilst I was on the way to the garage, I received a call from Jaguar Assistance to advise that Inchcape Jaguar Chester were expecting me and that there would be a courtesy car available.

When I arrived at Chester and eventually found the service desk (as it was poorly signposted), a young lady spoke to me about the car. She had no record of the vehicle or the courtesy car that had been allegedly arranged, despite Jaguar Assistance calling and advising them that the car was on the way. She was very abrupt and abrasive in her approach. Additionally, I had to wait 1 hour 20 minutes for the car to be booked in and a courtesy car provided. The level of customer service was exceptionally poor, especially when you would consider Jaguar as a 'Bespoke organisation'. Raised this matter with the service manager at Chester who did not seem the slight bit interested or concerned over my poor customer experience at the dealership!!

When I raised my complaint with Jaguar customer relations/complaints team, they advised that they were unable to deal with this matter as the car was a company vehicle. They obviously do not give any consideration or thought to poor customer service regardless of what is happening under the Jaguar banner!!

The customer experience and service from Inchcape Jaguar Chester was exceptionally poor. In comparison to the service from the VW, Mercedes and BMW this dealer was the worst and left a lot to be desired.

To add insult to injury, they decided to take my car on a 30 mile road test when the works had been completed. 10-15 miles is reasonable not 30!!!

If you appreciate quality customer service and do not wish to be spoken to in a patronising or abrupt nature then do not use this dealer!

24/10/19 Inchcape Jaguar Chester responded to advise that they were dealing with this matter internally. However, they have made no contact with me to discuss the issues as I was the individual to experience the poor levels of customer service. This actually sums up their dreadful approach to customers and their service provision!!"
2019-10-23,5,Great service
2019-10-22,1,"Inchcape Wirral - Be careful about buying GARDEX bodywork/interior protection from this company as they won't/ can't give a warranty for the work. I was upsold GARDEX protection on a recent car purchase. I was told that the protection had been applied to the car and a warranty would be issued by GARDEX. Nothing forthcoming over the last 5 weeks despite FOUR phone calls from me to the company; each time I was given assurances that someone (including the manager) would contact me to resolve the issue.

GARDEX tell me that Inchcape's computers are incompatible with theirs and Inchcape cannot give the warranty they are required to issue. GARDEX were very helpful and will attempt to resolve the issue over time. Shame about Inchcape......"
2019-10-22,5,"Work done on time and to complete satisfaction, very clean premises, even got a video of underside of car to inform if anything needed doing."
2019-10-21,1,"I've never had a worse customer experience than dealing with BRENDAN at the Liverpool dealership. He was unhelpful, disorganised and had zero customer service skills. I am a very reasonable and fair person and don't usually leave bad reviews though this experience has angered me immensely. I called Brendan to arrange a test drive of a car I had earmarked, he took all of my details over the phone. I arrived at the arranged time and Brendan immediately made clear he wasn't expecting us and proceeded to take down all of the details I'd already given him over the phone again. He then left us to find the keys to the car. 1st problem: they don't have the car I came to test drive. Great! He could have told us before we came and booked the time off work. 20 mins later after being left to just sit in the middle of the showroom with no explanation of what was going on we learnt of the 2nd problem: someone has moved the subsititue ""similar"" car we were going to drive, he just needs to ""go and find it"". 20 mins later the 3rd problem: he has found the car but the keys are lost and he ""doesn't know who drove it last"". By now i've waited 1 hour and had zero apology, no offer of a drink and quite frankly been treated like a burden rather than a customer. I don't know who decided to employ this guy but he is a huge liability to your business and needs serious training on how to deal with a customer when there is a problem. He also needs to organise his time better and prepare for a customer's arrival. We were waiting on a quote from Mercedes Liverpool to match somewhere we have found online but will now not consider it regardless of whether they can beat it due to Brendan's dismal customer service. They have lost this business and a lot of potential future business. We are really disappointed and will be taking our business elsewhere and spreading the word at just how bad this dealership experience was. The worst thing is - I am quite confident I just got dealt a bad hand in this sales guy and that there is likely many good guys here who would have dealt with the situation much better, though I have to be honest that this is the worst dealership experience I have ever had at the place I expected it least."
2019-10-21,4,"The response to a serious water leak was rather offhand and not appreciative of the effect it had on my wife and I. A loan car was provided and the windscreen resealed; so far so good.
Not what you would expect in any car, let alone a six month old car with 2600 miles only."
2019-10-21,5,"Excellent service from Coopers Ipswich, been a customer since 2013, brilliant!"
2019-10-21,3,Bought a new RR sport. Salesman helpful but mix up initially over available dealer discounts (versus what inchcape was advertising) plus really irritating that new vehicle not ready to drive off at pick up time and had to go to slyfield for a 30 min software update which all in all added about an hour. Don’t expect to buy an expensive new car and it not be ready. It had arrived at the dealership a few days before so no reason for it not to be ready.
2019-10-19,1,"An extremely poor after sales experience had left me unable to use the car for several day’s and in a position where I had to get the vehicle fixed myself.
The 12 month warranty is not worth the paper it is written on as my local Inchcape refused (yes refused!) to see the car. I sent the invoice to Inchcape over a week ago and although I was promised a refund on the work I had done, I have been waiting for a call back for over a week.
Despite several chases and failed promises by Inchcape I am still waiting for a refund and satisfactory reply to my complaint.
After sales is a crucial part to this business and with my experience I would steer well clear of this company in the future.

Update: TrustPilot replies with an email contact to address my concerns, however, unsurprisingly I have heard nothing back from them regarding my email."
2019-10-19,5,"An enjoyable buying experience.
Rick at Inchcape Manchester looked after us really well. He was knowledgeable and helpful throughout the buying process and his communication was excellent. The sales process was relaxed and we were very satisfied with the final deal offered."
2019-10-18,1,"Really disappointing.
I booked a test drive this afternoon.
Was kept waiting for an hour as the salesman was away on a delivery. Someone else eventually offered to let us see the vehicle but he took us to the wrong one, and had no knowledge of the car I'd booked to view.
We couldn't wait any longer so left without so much as seeing the car.
The saving grace was the lovely receptionist.
A shame as I'm left feeling as though my custom wasn't of value. Yes, it was a relatively inexpensive car but it could still have been a sale...
I'll be looking elsewhere now."
2019-10-18,4,car service at BMW - very relaxing wait but it did take 4 hours!
2019-10-18,1,"Awful company to deal with. Pre-paid for an advanced service pack and was told it would include 2 Services. Now being told I have to pay for second service. Customer Service at Cooper Teesside is non-existent. After being contacted by them at 17:55 I was told by guy on phone ""I was keeping him from his family"".
Will never buy another BMW from these guys again"
2019-10-17,5,"I had my car serviced and an mot At Macclesfield Audi. Brilliant service and kept me informed as to the work being carried out on my car. Thank you to the technician Martin Hill I will definitely be coming back again.

2019-10-17,1,"Audenshaw body shop North Manchester Car went in for damage came out with more damage to front of car now refusing to repair it is not a professional place if you visit there site you will see its not what you would expect it to be my advice is if your thinking of using this place do a little homework on reviews and if possible have a ride over to there back street body repair centre.

I gave you the chance to put this right already it should not take me having to post a review of your garage to make you listen 54 people have now read this review I just hope people do there homework and look at your bad reviews many of them as they will then save there selves a lot of trouble wont be buying my next car from yourselves either Have to try another vw franchise in Preston in a years time when my car is for renewal !!"
2019-10-16,1,"I bought an Jaguar approved XE diesel 12 months ago and to be honest if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have bothered. I have been spoken to extremely rudely by two managers, who both called me a liar and a boy racer (as if). The latest is my car has been recalled for H149 emissions. I booked the car in a month ago and I received a call today from Inchcape cancelling the booking as they don't have the parts. I questioned what parts and was told a quite long list including oil and filter change. I have just spent £250 on a service which if jaguar told me this was going to be done I would have waited before servicing the car. I have to say, once Jaguar have got your money, they don't really care after that. My last piece of advice to anyone thinking of buying a used Jaguar from Inchcape Jaguar is do not believe or trust the 165 multi point inspection they claim is done on every approved Jaguar,"
2019-10-15,5,The garage looked after me very well and the engineer pulled out all the stops to get me back on the road. Disappointing that I had to pay for a new tyre due to a puncture despite having an Audi lease deal including service an tyres.
2019-10-15,1,"My VW Tiguan failed its MOT on a suspension bush with less than 20000 miles on the clock. Inchcape offered no apology on behalf of VW and gave no explanation as to why this should happen on a car which was originally designed as a 4 wheel drive vehicle. Instead I was charged the massive sum of £64 plus fitting for what is essentially a lump of rubber with a metal tube through it! I was even charged for a new battery for the key fob. Obviously raised the bush failure with VW who were totally indifferent saying it was down to the retailer, Inchcape to make any offer of a goodwill gesture (which obviously they didn't). Needless to say I will be giving both Inchcape and VW a very wide birth and using a non franchised mechanic for all future work. Meanwhile the non caring insensitive VW conglomerate lumbers on!"
2019-10-14,5,"Fabulous service from start to finish. Nothing was too much trouble for Sam, our salesman, and he was efficient and responded to queries we had before pick up quickly. Would recommend him and Inchcape highly."
2019-10-14,1,"Really poor service and total lack of communication from the service department. Car has been with inchcape since early September with an engine failure on discovery sport - full service history from this dealer. After repeated calls from Lex and myself and poor communication between inhcape and JLR to resolve issue. Once JLR had the correct information decision made to replace engine.

Just ordered a new Discovery, will ensure all future services are undertaken elsewhere

I would not recommend this dealership"
2019-10-14,5,Great car buying experience thanks to both Nigel and Tony. I travelled 2.5 hours each way to get the specific car I wanted and thankfully the dealership made sure the rest of the buying experience went smoothly. I will use the dealership again.
2019-10-12,1,"No stars if it was available

Our local dealership is a joke
From customer service girls ignoring women
To buying a battery while on crutches to be told to carry it out myself.
But my hubbys Slk amg 55 was being worked on by an independent ordering part from main dealers well that didn’t come on the said day and no correspondence.
Vehicle needed coding went in didn’t do it the first day yet again no one informed the garage. So our mechanics fed up went to the garage to wait for it. The car has not been cleaned luckily as we noticed it had been bashed. Now I know we have no proof but it wasn’t there before it went to the garage and our mechs have always informed us of a problem so work it out.
Worst of all hubby goes into dealership to meet a defensive argumentative service manager. To be honest he was as much use as a chocolate teapot.
We have 3 Mercs in our household and non will ever go to Chester well Ellesmere Port ever again for anything.
Avoid at all costs."
2019-10-10,5,A most enjoyable and professional experience. Thank You.

2019-10-09,5,"Land Rover have given the best service I have ever received in comparison to all other car providers in the uk at the derby branch. I own a brand new Audi SQ5 and Audi’s service is not on the same level... close but no cigar, And Mercedes that my brother has purchased a brand new c class from falls below that of Ford from when I was starting out in my car days. They go above and beyond, treat my like I’m a friend yet professional at the same time. Always giving extras aswell at no charge."
2019-10-09,1,"Service wasn't great and the experience was poor. When I booked my vehicle in for a service and requested a coutesy vehicle I was told I would be on Inchcapes insurance which I would need to pay £15 for and it came with a £1,000 excess, fine no problem. Upon arriving I was asked for my insurance details, which I wasn't told to bring with me. This put me on the back foot as I then needed to locate my insurance details. When I tried to explain what I had been advised, when booking my vehicle, the service agent became very defensive and didn't let me explain which I found very annoying and made a point that she would not let me speak. I arranged for a courtesy vehicle as I had planned my whole day around the service visit due to it being my wedding anniversary. I arranged and planned to drop off my vehcile take a courtesy vehicle and return at the end of the day to collect my car. The courtesy vehicle was a VW UP which I refused to take and then had to wait on-site for the service to be completed which meant I missed taking my daughter swimming at 11 am and this them impacted my whole day which I had planned. The reason to refuse to take the VW UP is that there was no way of me fitting two baby seats and a pram into the vehicle, hence I have a VW Golf to accommodate my requirements. My last service in 2018 was provided with a VW Golf+ but this time it was a VW UP which was not sufficient for my needs. A very poor experience in my mind which to be honest ruined my day! I'm still waiting for my service certificates which the service agent said she would email me. I will not be retunrning to VW Inchcape Bury for the 3rd service or any further work required on my car."

2019-10-03,1,"New BMW - Terrible expectation setting on car delivery. Followed by picking up a brand new car with a ""Replace Batter"" warning light. I was told. Not to worry as they would 'book me in for next week' 'its only a 20 minute job'. Now after multiple calls unreturned I've had to book it in for 2 weeks time. Inchcape ruin the BMW brand. I've been to Thames Ditton and now avoid them and bought this car from Cobham and find the experience as bad"

2019-10-01,5,"I had never had any dealings with Inchcape VW Swindon prior to this week. My husband and I were looking for a newer car. We spotted one on their website which seemed perfect. A Tiguan R Line with Tech pack. Rang them on the Sunday and arrived the following day to view the car. Paid deposit on the Sunday. Nicky the sales guy was amazing. So helpful, informative. Just could not do enough for you. He knew everything there is to know about the car. Not being too pushy with it. We felt really at ease with the whole process. Would definitely 100% recommend this garage if you were interested in purchasing a VW vehicle. Nicky is the man to see."
2019-10-01,5,"Staff extremely friendly and curteous, always replied to my emails Lewiis very courteous and Thomas too , car was as i ordered no problems"
2019-09-30,5,Martin Collins- most helpful and friendly salesperson ever! Well informed and genuine guy who knows and loves his cars. We could tell he wanted us to be 100% happy with our purchase; he picked out the perfect car for us!
2019-09-30,5,The team at Inchcape UK are amazing. Nothing is too much trouble; everything is explained; communication is timely. I have taken my sirocco to them for 9 years and have never had cause to complain.

This is my second (and last, will never come or recommend) worst experience with Cooper!"

Hi Rm,

Thank you for your review.

I'm disappointed to see that you've had a poor experience.

We would like to work towards a resolution, so if you are willing, please email us at xxxxxxxxxx. Please mention this Trustpilot review in your email.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, Inchcape's Customer Experience Team"
2019-09-30,5,"Good communication, service carried out, video sent by email"
2019-09-30,5,"Great experience, Sam was really helpful. Had never thought of getting a Passat until my wife suggested it was an option but after testing one out and seeing the GTE in the showroom i was sold. Lucky enough to get the new model and the range means i'm covered for my work journeys on electric alone. Would recommend and will probably use (again) for a private purchase in the future."
2019-09-29,5,"I have just taken delivery of my new Jaguar F Type 3.0 Dynamic. At every step of the process, the Sales Executive, Martyn Harvey, explained all elements of the selection of the vehicle and the documentation with great detail. His product knowledge is very extensive, this was of a great benefit during the whole process and can only be commended.
Together with the other members of the Inchcape team at Guildford Jaguar, they have provided an excellent customer experience, one which I will recommend whenever the opportunity permits."
2019-09-29,5,Very knowledgeable staff. Always go the extra mile to provide a good deal. Have been back to VW Inchcape Manchester multiple times for a new car.
2019-09-28,5,Great and helpful dealership. Would buy from them again. It's that simply.
2019-09-28,5,"Excellent service from start to finish.I was kept informed all the time my car was being looked at.The staff here are very helpful and bent over backwards to sort things out.
I will definitely use Cooper BMW Ipswich again.
Many thanks for your help."
2019-09-27,1,"Spoke to dealer in morning, but when I turned up I was told to wait 10 mins, I waited 50 mins and asked reception 4 times, then gave up and drove back home, been couple of hours still no call back.

Inchape Warrington

I traveled 20 miles to get there"
2019-09-27,1,"The worst car dealership I have ever dealt with. Mercedes of Derby are an absolute joke organisation that has no customer service skills, fail to return calls and absolutely give false information why a certain part is required.
They also return your car back worse than it already is."
2019-09-26,5,"We called in to have a look around - and came out having purchased a new car! There wasn’t one in stock which I wanted, so we sat down with the sales executive Alan Woods to ‘build’ a car- a first for me but thoroughly enjoyable.
We were kept informed by Alan throughout the process of the car being built and it even came in earlier than expected. Alan made sure it was turned around for us in about 36 hours. He even sent us a video showing us the car and how to work some of the controls.
The form filling part was kept to a minimum too which was a bonus.
Alan made us feel very welcome, he was professional throughout, very helpful and informative. I’m glad I came to Inchcape for my new car and I look forward to a long and happy relationship with them. Going to be buying my future cars from them."
2019-09-26,5,It's the second car I have purchased from Inchcape Mercedes. Fantastic services from calls through to face to face. Happy to listen and understand the requirements/situation. Always offer to advise on ways to purchase or car models. I'd also like to highlight Jay who was superb during the sale. Buying a car can be stressful but you guys make it easy. Thanks again!
2019-09-25,5,"I have just taken delivery of my new Mini and I love it. Jack Wray, who feels like my personal adviser, has helped me buy two Minis so far and he is an absolutely lovely chap. Very accommodating and knows his stuff. He makes buying a car a really fantastic experience."
2019-09-25,1,"Steer clear of Inchape Derby! Bought a Range Rover from there 4 months ago. Beautiful car but it had problems from the outset, within the first month, Derby had it back for 2 weeks. The ‘head’ technicians couldn’t even fix a leak or identify a rubber trim hanging off. It has had on-going electrical faults, & sadly we have returned the car- registration KU17 TYA -in case anyone looking to purchase. What is completely appalling though is the total lack of ownership from anyone in the Dealership. Calls weren’t returned, complaints were made to senior managers & the complaints department- with no acknowledgement! The one person, who eventually helped us- has left! He probably got sick of the complaints. Our car was returned last Thursday, we were promised the money back as soon as it was checked- that was 6 days ago. Each day we are told of another ‘hold up’!! Absolute joke- have never received such poor service. DO NOT BUY FROM INCHAPE"
2019-09-24,1,"Purchased a vehicle from inchcape Southport. By Far the worst customer service received to date. Once the car was collected, I started having problem immediately. They wouldn’t take ownership or even answer the phone. I asked for a client service charger or complaint procedure and still haven’t received it. I asked who I could email to discuss my issues they gave me someone name and gmail email address as oppose to a genuine individual. I plan to to take them to trading standards over the faulty car they have sold me. This brand is using Mercedes name and getting away with it, am planning on writing to Mercedes CEO and warning them as well. Avoid this company and avoid Southport in particular Ian Mcdonald."
2019-09-24,1,"The worst customer service I have ever received from Inchape Jaguar Landrover Chester. Car (Jaguar XF) booked in for problem under extended warranty. Arranged for collect and deliver. Afternoon before collection advised they needed car for 2 days and they wouldn't supply a courtesy vehicle. After car collected then informed I must agree to pay a diagnostic charge of £100 plus just in case it wasn't covered by warranty. I had never been informed of this. After a heated exchange with after sales Manager they returned car without doing any work.
Inchcape are not interested in customer retention or empathy. Nobody will take ownership of issues ( I have spoken to 4 different people in just over 12 hours)"
2019-09-24,5,Fantastic service many thanks
2019-09-23,1,"Disappointed with faulty car purchase from this garage. Suffered brake failure, seatbelt failure and an intermittent clutch problem. Raised concerns within 30 days as per citizens advice, and the garage have rejected our right to return the car. Numerous visits to the garage, to give them opportunity to fix the faults have been fruitless. Legal action will now be the last result. Do not use this garage. 1 year warranty not worth the paper it’s written. Buyer beware."
2019-09-23,5,"I returned to this dealership to purchase a new Jaguar F-Pace.
Richard and all who were involved in the sale were superb people to deal with.
They listened to what I wanted in both vehicle and finance and provided me with a car and a package that was suitable for my needs.
I would not hesitate to recommend the team at Jaguar Norwich.
The aftercare and support after the sale has been fantastic and we will come back for our third vehicle from you soon."
2019-09-20,1,"Visited Inchcape Wirral with concerns of faulty driver airbag (rattling sound coming directly from the centre of steering wheel) I was advised by VW customer services to have the issue diagnosed.
Day 1: dropped car off 9:30am however the printer wasn’t working so couldn’t print off the insurance details for courtesy car. I was told not to worry and that I won’t be charged the £15. (I very much doubt I was even insured)
5pm phone call to say car not ready, will be tomorrow.
Day 2: Phone call to advise they need to remove the dashboard at a further cost of £400. I question why remove a perfectly good dashboard when the issue is on steering wheel airbag?
Phone call to advise the airbag has been removed, lubricated springs and rattle significantly better. (So glad I didn’t fall for the remove dash scam)
I then complained to Inchcape customer service 2 weeks ago and even though they promise to respond to me still nothing.
Worst of all Inchcape have reported back to VW UK that no issue found with my airbag so VW cannot intervene to have the part rectified as a matter of a safety concern. They say good dealers will argue on behalf of their customer to rectify airbags purely as a safety issue. However Inchcape would rather attempt to rip me off for more money. So now I have no faith in Inchcape VW Wirral and will pass this scam on to Trading Standards hopefully they get better response and a full explanation. Shame on you Inchcape! (Lets just hope my lubricated airbag functions correctly if I’m ever unfortunate to need it)"
2019-09-19,5,Very good all round service
2019-09-18,2,Had to wait half an hour dropping off for a pre-booked service. Oil spilled over the engine and engine cover during the service. Got the registration number wrong for the service notes which caused further delay at drop off and confusion when I came to collect the car too.
2019-09-17,5,"From just calling in Land Rover with the wife for a Browse,(DREAMING) We were approached by Alan Wood a salesman.
What a genuinely nice guy who understood we had a budget and the fact our current car was on pcp.
Alan found us our dream car online, then took us out for a test drive in a similar model. There was no rush and absolutely no pressure applied for the sale.
Alan did his job and got us to the figures we could afford and even kept in contact with us over the weekend while he was off.
Having to work away lead to my dad having to pick up the new car with my wife. Alan went above and beyond to ensure my dad and wife were happy before leaving the show room. My dads a grumpy bugger but couldn't praise Alan enough.
In all the whole buying a new car experience was stress free and a pleasant experience.
Since being in possession of our new Discovery, Alan has been in contact numerous times which is a nice touch. Too many times the customer is forgotten about once out the showroom.
Cheers Land Rover Inchcape, Happy customer"
2019-09-16,5,"I recently purchased an XF Sportbrake from Inchcape Jaguar Norwich. The whole process was smooth and trouble free, despite being 600 miles away from the dealership. A big thanks in particular to Blake Jarvis, who dealt with everything including sorting the delivery, and to the representative who brought the car up and provided a detailed and knowledgeable demonstration. The service provided was better than I have had previously, from face to face car purchases. I can definitely recommend Inchcape Jaguar Norwich, wherever you are in the UK."

2019-09-14,1,"I have owned five VW cars and highly rate them. Yesterday my car went in for a minor service and MOT. It is a five year old VW Passat estate Alltrack which has been VW Main Agent serviced since we bought it from new. We average 10k miles a year. As I was in meetings all day I gave them my wife phone number. They called her and the end result, a minor service costed at £170 has escalated to £1300. My wife who is a stoic person of integrity was left in tears by the experience. This is not the first time i have had this experience. Six weeks ago I took the car into Inchcape with a headlight out and they wanted over £300.00 to replace it. Took it to a highly reputable local private garage where they replaced the motorised Zenon unit for £120.00. I would have expected a much more empathic style from Inchcape given their estimated costs had escalated by 80%."
2019-09-13,1,"I am still waiting for a reply from Inchcape head office after my poor experience in the Cheltenham branch, I was told my complaint was being looked at on the 28th August 2019, I’m so glad their customers concerns are a top priority."
2019-09-13,5,"Just phoned Cooper BMW Tunbridge Wells to try to book my BMW car and bike in for MOTs on the same day and requested a loan bike so I don't have to sit around and can use my waiting time to bring the car in.

Was expecting a nightmare booking call with 2 different service departments. Katie in bike service got it straight away and said leave it with me. 10 minutes later she calls back: 2 MOTs booked and loan bike organised. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! WELL DONE KATIE!"
2019-09-12,1,"Simply years of poor customer service from a Mercedes Service perspective in the Warrington branch. Problem is Liverpool, Warrington and Southport all Inchcape so if you live in this area you are a bit stuck. Charge for courtesy cars unless you have a service contract - rarely can you get through to them - yesterday tried twice with 2 different options - mid afternoon- no answer! Quality of work is shoddy at best and I have at least 3 examples including car coming back with additional issue following a recall. Staff do try really hard, very polite but fail. Minimum 30 mins to drop car off and regularly at least that to collect. Last tome I was there it was 45 mins each then I found they had not done the work properly! Always check they have completed the work before you drive off - oh and £168 an hour labour - apparently! Here, you do NOT get what you pay for. Anything out of warranty use an independent."
2019-09-12,2,"The purchasing experience was spot on and Marc, the salesman, was professional, courteous and efficient. Regrettably, once you drive the car away, the excellent service then ceases. My C-Class estate had a problem with the 'stop-start' function, essentially it has never worked at all. I contacted the dealer and expected them to offer to sort it out for me, given that it was primarily a 'Sale of Goods' issue and not really a warranty issue. Perhaps something like 'bring it in, we'll have a look at it straight away, make you a coffee etc'. In short, I was advised to simply 'book the car into my local Mercedes dealer' and have it repaired under warranty. Now I have to find a day to get this booked into a Merc dealer, with all the associated inconvenience. Certainly wont be using Inchcape to either buy my next car or get this one serviced..."
2019-09-12,5,Excellent Service as usual
2019-09-11,5,"I had my car MOT this week and the service was excellent Mark Critcher the Service advisor was very helpful and gave excellent service and advice. Thank you Mark.
I also spoke to.Sales Executive James Alexander about a potential change of car he was most helpful and very thorough nothing was too much trouble exceptionally helpful I will certainly ask for him when I go back."
2019-09-11,1,"If you read the online reviews, you'll notice that sales are generally positive but service and after-sales are the opposite.

For a company that claims to be ""passionate about ensuring our customers come first, every time"", the Preston showroom has a strange way of showing it.

You'll be offered a coffee when you arrive and your car will be clean when you get it back, but whether it's been fixed properly (or at all) is a different story.

The struggles start just by trying to communicate and arrange a booking in the first place. Sometimes, you'll get through to the right person, others you'll be on hold for 10-15 minutes only to be cut off completely.

Then there's the length of time between your initial contact and the actual appointment. Four to eight weeks is usual, which is fine if it's a scheduled service, but waiting almost 2 months to return for something that wasn't fixed or an ongoing or time-critical problem is not acceptable.

The quality of repair doesn't seem up to standard either.

It took 5 visits over 6 months to have a small piece of plastic replaced - all the paperwork said the work had been completed.

I have two ongoing issues that were begun under warranty (in 2018) that are still not fully resolved. Needless to say, the weeks and months between appointments mean this has dragged on so long that the warranty has expired and it's now being hinted at that I will be charged for any further work to rectify problems that were not completed to standard in the first place.

I have lost count of the sheer amount of time I have lost on the phone, driving to and from the dealership and from work.

The complaints procedure seems to be very flawed too. Emailing tellusmore initially produced some results by putting me in contact with a certain level of management but when that avenue of contact dried up with unreplied emails, even directly contacting the GM (as suggested on the Inchcape website) didn't even result in a courtesy response.

Beyond contacting tellusmore there doesn't seem to be any way of complaining higher than those in charge at the dealership.

All things considered, it's been more than disappointing owning a Jaguar, which is a shame because the car is very nice and it's purely down to Inchcape Jaguar Preston."
2019-09-10,5,"Excellent customer service from Aaron Spence Service Advisor, and the Inchcape Jaguar Land Rover York team today when my car was in for an annual service and MOT.

I can thoroughly recommend Inchcape Jaguar.I would take not my XF anywhere else.

2019-09-10,1,"Very poor customer service at Inchcape Oxford. I had a tyre problem while on holiday in the area. The valve on my PSF tyre was broken and had to be replaced. Have always had great service from my local Toyota dealer so felt I was using a trusted brand. Valve was changed with no hassle. During my recent MOT, my local Toyota garage called to let me know there was a problem with that wheel - something 'rattling' around inside it. Turned out to be the valve that Inchcape Oxford had replaced - they just left it in my wheel!! Contacted Inchcape Oxford to complain.
The service managers approach was something I wouldn't expect from a local owner managed garage, certainly not what I'd expect from a big company. He wanted proof that the valve was in the tyre, asking for photos of it in the wheel. I explained that it had been found by another Toyota dealership. I felt that the presence of the valve in the wheel was unacceptable. Not so it seems! As the valve wasn't likely to damage the wheel, the attitude was very much a shrug of the shoulders.
I accept it did no damage but the confrontational attitude given that it was clear a mistake had been made was completely unacceptable. You pay a premium to have work done at a place like Inchcape in the belief that if something goes wrong, they'll be professional. Not so it seems. A truly terrible experience and personally I wouldn't use an Inchcape garage again and I certainly wouldn't dream of buying a car from one."
2019-09-09,1,"Visited Swindon Audi looking to purchase a new car (we already own an Audi purchased from another location because of previous poor experiences with the Swindon dealership. ). Clearly busy but when we enquired whether or not we could speak to a salesman to discuss a new car purchase we were told they were all busy and could we “come back later”. No effort to go and see how long it might be until we could be seen or helped.

So guess what? We left and went to a different dealership and purchased a new car from them instead, and no, it’s not an Audi. I think your reception staff need some better training, they just lost you a new car sale."
2019-09-09,5,Great service as always
2019-09-09,2,"Inchcape Jaguar, Preston.
Flashy place but ends there. Impersonal and inefficient.
Just hope that your car doesn't need a repair under warranty.
Car has been serviced by them every year.
Quoted over 3 weeks waiting time to get it worked on under warranty and over 8 weeks if you needed a courtesy car. Unbelievable.
Phoned another Jaguar dealer - 1 week with courtesy car. Result.
Needless to say they won't be servicing my car again.
Buy from here at your peril."
2019-09-08,1,"Totally and utterly ignorant staff.
Ive tried to buy a car from the staff at the Teeside BMW branch twice.
First time,, their car was priced incorrectly on Autotrader - I highlighted this and then they totally ignored me. A respectable garage would maybe apologise and thank you for highlighting the error.

Next time, they offered me a ridiculous trade in price that was £1500 less than we buy any car....I queried this and yes....they ignored me. A respectable garage would perhaps try to do a deal with you or at least match the we buy any car price. Not here.....they just totally blank you.

Never known a garage like it.....you try to buy a £40000 car and they ignore you!
How on earth do they stay in business?are the staff that arrogant?

Never mind, I shall deal elsewhere and give them a wide berth.

Better to find out now about their total poor attitude to potential customers rather than after dealing on a £40,000 car."
2019-09-06,5,Another flawless purchase from the ever efficient and professional Adrian Hart at Southampton Land Rover.
2019-09-06,5,Flawless customer care both during a vehicle purchase and then subsequent servicing. No issues at all.
2019-09-05,1,"never take your car to the Leicester Mercedes branch, they are totally useless. they have my car for three weeks awaiting a seal. they do not contact you and just state there is a backlog. very poor service and not a garage you would associate with Mercedes"
2019-09-05,5,Outstanding service. Would highly recommend.
2019-09-05,5,"I thought this was going to be another 1 star review from me when Inchape told me I was not going to get my new 69 Reg Golf R on the 2nd Sept as promised. Was sure not least as their employee said I could have the car but with a 19 Reg; yeh, right!

In stepped their Steve Hughes who was a hero. He got VW to pay for a loan 19 Reg Golf R until mine arrived. Had the loan Golf for 8 miles, literally, then my new Golf arrived. Steve was tireless in resolving the issue, which was VW's fault as they messed up on registrations on a number of cars.

All's well that ends well, thanks to Steve; Inchape, give the guy a medal and a pay rise."

2019-08-31,2,"*** A REVIEW OF TWO PARTS!!!*** EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT DISAPPOINTING F-PACE EXPERIENCE FOR THE 2ND TIME !!!! *** Firstly we must acknowledge the exemplary customer service shown to my wife recently by Emily at York Jaguar in the aftermath of the breakdown of our 8 month old (see further details below!!!) F-Pace which developed a gas sensor problem that meant it was no longer driveable beyond the York dealership just a couple of miles away fortunately. Although York Jaguar (our local dealership although the car had come from Farnells in Leeds) themselves advised they could not offer a courtesy car for 2 weeks, Emily reassured me by saying I would not be leaving without a car and she personally contacted Jaguar Assist (it being a break down) My wife was made very welcome with a coffee etc and within 30 minutes Emily had my wife in a brand new Discovery Sport (provided by Jaguar Assist not the dealership) which facilitated her continuing her journey to see me in hospital in Leeds that day and every day for the following week. All credit to this efficient, professional young lady who took ownership of the matter and then continued to keep us updated with our own car's repairs progress.
HOWEVER ... part 2 of this review ... Emily's excellent customer service should not disguise the fact that it is beyond disappointing that an 8 month old F-Pace bought new in January of this year developed an unexpected problem some 6000 miles before it's first service was due. This compounds our disappointment with our Jaguar purchase given that this is our 2nd F-Pace ... the first one, brand new again, was collected around 22 December 2018 and on New Year's Day of this year with about 700 miles on the clock, in the fast lane of the M1 returning from London, it suddenly lost all power due to a catastrophic electronic failure!!! I managed to 'coast' the powerless car onto the hard shoulder thankful it was New Years Day with far fewer wagons and HGVs around to navigate. Without a shadow of a doubt my wife, myself and our dog travelling with us were lucky we weren't all killed in some sort of pile up. Jaguar Assist in these circumstances were utterly useless (situation already dealt with back then) but we did eventually get back home in an Enterprise Hire car. With the protection of our Consumer Rights and Trading Standards, we invoked our full right to return said vehicle for a full refund to which Jaguar futilely attempted to resist. We were entitled to a full no quibble refund in actual fact as a) the car was less than 30 days old b) had under 1000 miles on it. After much discussion and debate and looking at our options to secure an alternative brand new car (minimal and I need a car for work doing some 25k miles per year for business) we accepted another brand new F-Pace from Jaguar and that we collected end January. NOT AN IMPRESSIVE 9 MONTHS OF JAGUAR F-PACE PORTFOLIO OWNERSHIP!!! IT IS ON OUR MINDS THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER 'FRIDAY AFTERNOON ON THE PRODN LINE' CAR ... THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. JAGUAR TAKE NOTE."
2019-08-31,1,"Bought a Trade car form them 7 weeks ago which was on a private number. Was told comes with the correct V5 on original number plate.
7 weeks later i am still chasing the V5 and its like no one is interested because i have paid them and not their problem any more. Was left on hold for 42 minutes today. Car is sold and customer picking it up in the morning. Cant change owners or tax it. Shocking after sales"
2019-08-31,1,BMW Inchcape Croydon - 3 weeks to change 2 tyres and counting...my wife’s car has Bmw protect tyre insurance. She suffered a puncture and so the car has gone into the dealership to have 2 new tyres...and we are still waiting - really not acceptable - this is a very straightforward matter - our local tyre shop has confirmed they can have the same bmw spec tyres in stock within 24 hours. Why pay for BMW tyre insurance with service like this?? Car Reg: MA08GAN. Begs the question: how many Bmw Croydon technicians does it take to change a light bulb?
2019-08-29,5,"First class customer service contrasting with truly woeful service received recently from our insurers who seemingly just don’t care.

2019-08-28,5,"Fristly this is my first venture into owning a Jaguar, having grown up around E-type's decided time to try. recently purchased an XK as future classic / summer days out, usual retirement dream. Did not buy from Jaguar Derby but that is exactly where it is going for hopefully not too many repairs, maintenance, servicing etc. Called into see service and book in for warning on dash. Adam Luckwell dealt with my requirements and have to say 'Excellent' service from this individual.I could not have wished for a more professional, polite and knowledgeable response, he quickly organised the date time and explained what the process would be. It is rare to find such an efficient level of customer service, very impressed and would not hesitate in putting the trust of my big boys Toy in their capable Hands. Also had a pleasant chat with a gentleman David Orme, again extremely polite and he showed a genuine real interest in my needs and requirements and as I understand it David is part of the Sales side. it is pleasing to find a dealership where each function operates together as one customer driven service. Experience tells me in any product based company if I as a customer work with staff and they are the experts then a solution can and will always be found. closing a million thanks to Adam for his speedy handling of my requirements. cheers."

2019-08-27,1,"Inchcape Head Office's Customer Services team give the impression on Trust Pilot that they are listening to customers' concerns and have a genuine desire to investigate complaints; wishing to 'have another go' at righting a wrong (or several wrongs in our case).

The reality behind their 'please get in touch with us' pleadings is entirely different; in our long standing experience of them and our evidenced complaints, they accept their poor standards of service at Cooper BMW and expect their customers to accept them too - and to bear the consequences without compensation!

Who in their right mind would accept (and what type of organisation would offer) a free MOT at the same branch that had messed up its service under so many of its own customer charter headings and left the customer, inter alia, with oil damage to the car's leather upholstery?"

Costing me £40 car tax, don't trust them when they say leave it to us. Transpires the salesman was in benidorm and couldn't be bothered getting someone to deal whilst he was on a stag do
Didn't fill the tank as agreed either. Approx 40 emails later to dvla and their management team to get back my money. Was on my way to court with them and they relented
Disgraceful. Load of rubbish. Hold on to your wallet"
2019-08-22,1,"VW Touareg Part 2.

Dear readers

My brand new Touareg r line tech is still parked up gathering dust somewhere at West London Inchcape VW, I haven’t seen it for over 3 months, it broke down on the day of the handover and eventually another 18 separate faults occurred in 3 months from new including major software issues which cannot be fixed until new software becomes available, guess what I’m still paying £759.14 monthly, VW finance, VW UK, and VW inchcape all know this but couldn’t care less, they will care this month when the £759.14 doesn’t arrive. Seems they are all blaming each other for supplying a faulty car which cannot be repaired or sold. What’s awful is I’m innocent in all this and have honoured everything from my side, I’ve had no offers no settlement, nothing to resolve the money side of things, no loan car, nothing, still Uber still love me. My solicitors love me, I hate to write this review but people need to be warned that Inchcape don’t give a ++++. It’s a shame that after buying in excess of 30 VWs for personal and my company I’m changing brands, we just took delivery from Peugeot of 2 new fully loaded expert vans, with more to come, I’m going to sell our new UP GTi and new Golf R once this is all sorted as it’s left an awful taste.

What’s a shame is I did like the people at Inchcape but collectively the business doesn’t care, my company is backed by the 5th largest company in the world and in my next board meet I’m going to tell the board my experience with Inchcape, as this particular huge company buys thousands of cars and vans! In the UK.

2019-08-22,1,"Very bad communication service
You call their head office to be able to get to staff on site
They take the call & never transfer you nor they inform the engineer to call you
They hang up the phone & interrogations are endless , normally you advise the name your name taken & you are put through
But with these company you have first to give number plate of the car your name reason for call
It appears that they have a bunch of ladies doing the dirty work of spying on their employees rather than providing a good customer service
What a shame"
2019-08-21,1,"Communication, or rather the lack of, seems to be a big issue at Inchcape Mercedes of Oxford for us and for others who have posted a review. We bought a brand new car which has had a recurring management system error ever since we bought it but their diagnostic systems are not sufficient to pick them up. They eventually agreed to do some work which the Service Manager said will have fixed the problem but then he won't provide us with a report telling us what they have done. In addition, the problem is still occurring and we now have another issue but no one wants to speak to us about it. Having emailed the Service Manager and Engineer as well as called him, and left messages with colleagues who promise to pass it on and even tell me that the Engineer is sitting next to them, numerous times no one is getting back to us. Like others have said, it seems that once you have bought the car they have no interest in anything that doesn't create money for them. Poor customer service that I didn't expect from a company like Mercedes"
2019-08-21,1,"Bought an amg c63 - with all the assurances about the preparation of the car and a so called full MB warranty. Took the car to France to go skiing. The car immediately flagged a coolant warning light. Took the car into MB Brentford for an air con sensor issue. They advised oil leaks from the rocker and sump that had been there for months but not covered under warranty. They’d never seen an AMG with these issues before. Have been fobbed off by MB Warrington Inchape. Told it was being escalated to Paul Antrobus and Andrea. Calls not returned. I have an e46 M3 that is 15 years old - that doesn’t leak oil. A 25 year old Porsche 993 - that doesn’t leak oil. A 10 year old Ducati 848 - that doesn’t leak oil and it’s italian! I am

2019-08-20,5,"I took my pride and joy Mercedes C350e to Inchcape Mercedes Benz in Derby on St. Christopher’s Way on 19/08/19. This was due having excellent service from my first visit here 4 months ago which I also gave a 5 star review for. On arrival the car park was very busy and full as usual, but they seem to be making the best of the limited space available. As there was no available parking space, I was kindly directed by a member of staff to an area I could leave my car temporarily until it was taken into the garage. The receptionist Palo Samra was as cheerful, friendly and helpful as I remember from last time. I was directed to the comfortable waiting area where I enjoyed a complimentary refreshment which was most welcome. Without waiting very long at all, I was greeted by service advisor, Adrian Benford. After a handshake and kind exchange of pleasantries we went through the work required. A first service and repair of a broken rear seat release handle. Everything was explained clearly. On this visit I opted to take advantage of a complimentary loan vehicle. Their paperwork and insurance was explained fully and I was shown to a beautiful E class. It was immaculately clean and a pleasure to drive. While I was at home I received a video from technician, Lewis Bailey giving me a video with details about my service and health check. I enjoyed this and gave this service excellent compliments in my last review. I soon received a text message to say my car was ready for collection. I met Adrian again, went through some final paperwork and was escorted to my car, which I was very impressed to see had been valeted superbly well. After a farewell and a thank you from Adrian, I drove home in my well serviced, shiny and clean Mercedes, with a smile on my face. I was also grateful of a follow up thank you by text message from Adrian. Well Inchcape, you have excelled again. Thanks to everyone who made my experience enjoyable. I shall be sure to use Inchcape in the future and recommend this place unreservedly."

We travelled from London to pick up the car; they were late meeting us at the station, kept us waiting for another hour at the showroom and then the car hadn't been checked over and was not ready so more delay. Beware parts may have been taken from your car to sort out another new car so check carefully. Our missing parts finally arrived 3 weeks later after many emails, phone calls and false promises. We got everything in the end but they seem poorly managed and hopelessly disorganised so be ready for it. We have since received parts meant for someone else's car - another unhappy customer?"

After buying a car from the dealership for over 20k, I was driving it an hour before the mirror glass in the wing wirror popped out and was hanging by the wire! I contacted them to see what they could do because I had to the car less than an hour. They said take it your local dealer and see if they can fix the issue through warranty. I done so and they said there was clips broken on the mirror glass. They also found out there is something lose or broken behind the front grill.

I contacted Coventry and after 2 weeks of communication and no response they said they couldn’t authorise it. After sales an terrible also.

My family have numerous Mercedes cars and if any problems occur the Stratstone dealership they bought from are keen to help them out.

Long story short, they are an absolute shambles

2019-08-07,1,"I bought a car from Mercedes Benz of Oxford in February I REALLY WISH I DIDNT BUY IT.

I went in done a deal, the day before collection I received a call to say the car wasn't ready, we then agreed I would collect the car and they would take it back a week later to put right - I said fine

I then collected the car and was told the spare key had cracked, I would receive a new one, chased and chased then it magically appeared. The Key was posted through my letter box and didn't work on my car the dealership said it was the battery they will post one... 2 weeks later the battery arrived I changed it with the dealership on the phone it didn't work. I asked them what to do. A few days later they said I can book in with my local dealer and they can reprogram the key so I did this.

The car went to MB Heathrow who infrmed me 1) I shouldnt have been sent a blank key as this is against MB rules
2) they cant reprogram the key as they do not know the origin of it.

At this point MBUK go involved where they ordered a new key and got it reprogrammed - however no one has asked for the blank key I got sent


During this process my boss asked for a copy of my service records I called MB Heathrow who informed me although the car should have had a service it hasn't. Again I told MBUK who magically got a piece of paper to say it has been serviced and logged to the system but for me to keep faith in the brand they would re service the car anyway.

Do not buy from this dealer they will take your money but will not put things right these are basics and it has taken the first 4 months of my new car to put right."
2019-08-07,1,"Had to wait 5 weeks for a courtesy car when the drivers door window on my C Class would not close properly. This was the same problem that had occurred 12 months previously and was ""fixed"" under warranty
Booked my car in on the Friday as arranged and was told that someone would be in touch during the day with updates - no contact from Mercedes. At 17:55 I noticed a text message from mercedes sent at 17:30 saying my car was ready for collection - I then sent a text message asking whether the car was fixed or whether further work was required - no response.
I resent the text on the Saturday, the only response I received was another text saying my car was ready for collection. I rang the dealership and asked whether my car was fixed only to be told that as a precautionary measure a part was required. I said I was not prepared to wait another 5 weeks for a courtesy car to be made available, was told that the part could be fitted while I waited, the car was booked in for a week on the Monday.
I arrived at the dealership at 08:00 as arranged and was told that the work would take 1 hour. I waited. When I was still waiting at 10:50, nearly 3 hours later, I asked for an update. I was then told that an additional part was required and this was in stock but would take an additional 3 hours to fit. I was given a courtesy car. I was sent a text at approx 14:30 to say my car was ready for collection. When I arrived there at 15:00 I was asked to take a set, it was then another 30 minutes before I was seen to and my car key returned.

They accepted responsibility and the car was booked in for another repair. Car collected again, still not washed. My Car felt a bit rough but I put this down to dirt from the bad weather. I washed the car the following weekend only to find my car was full of overspray. I am selling the car and the overspray will impact my sale significantly. I have dealt with the general manager Rebecca and to be honest I find her to be inadequate in her role as general manager, therefore I have resorted to contacting Stefan Bomhard and James Brearley having managed to obtain their genuine contact details. Anyone else having issues with the Inchcape group I am happy to provide these details through private message. I find Mercedes are and continue to demonstrate their customer service is declining rapidly and the reviews I have read prove this.

Michael was a waste of space and his manager Adele also didn’t bother working up a deal after meeting her face 2 face.

The worst service I’ve ever received from a dealership, not sure they actually wanted to sell cars..."
2019-08-02,1,"TO BE CLEAR - THIS IS ABOUT Inchcape Mercedes-Benz of Liverpool

To say that I am extremely disappointed in the service provided by this dealership recently is an understatement. I make no apologies for the length of the review as I wanted to give you a full breakdown of our issues.

We originally arranged to see a specific vehicle on the 14th April, and after 15 minutes waiting for the sales advisor that our appointment was with (who had clearly taken another customer at the time we were due) we were greeted by Dale, who approached us with the first line being that the lady we arranged the appointment with was with another customer and therefore unfortunately he would have to deal with us. Great start! I do have to say at this point that Dale has tried all he can to help us. 40 minutes later no keys were found for the vehicle we had arrived to see. It turned out that the previous day someone who worked in the workshop had looked at the car for their sister, and subsequently kept hold of the keys. A wasted 3 hour round trip!

Dale kindly called us early the following week to say that there was another vehicle arriving exactly the same, only a premium model with less mileage which we subsequently booked a test drive for. Good Friday we turned up to test drive the car, and upon initial inspection the car was filthy and full of scratches – some really bad ones on the rear near side bumper. We were totally assured that if we chose to purchase this vehicle, then all the scratches would be put right and the car would be spotless. We agreed to purchase the vehicle which we had wanted to pay (including Part ex) cash for, however at this point it appeared that the most important thing was that we took finance to get an extended warranty.

We subsequently agreed to collect the vehicle on Saturday 27th April at 11am to give time for the paint work to be completed. I was called on Friday the 26th after being pushed all day to sign the finance agreement and was asked if I could collect at 12noon and not 11am as this would give them time to sort the finance. I was called again later that day and told that the scratches to the rear of the bumper were that bad, they couldn’t be buffed out but had to be painted so rearranged to collect the Monday after. I reluctantly said that would be fine as it was more important to collect the vehicle in the right condition. Upon coming to work on Monday, I realised I had an all-day meeting today and therefore called to change collection to the weekend. Your staff said that they would wait behind until 7pm if I could make it Tuesday night. Month end…

We therefore travelled from Manchester to Liverpool to collect the car, and guess what? The car had not been painted, there are still numerous scratches in the paintwork and the way the vehicle was cleaned is certainly not up to standard. It looks like it had had a quick wash off and certainly no polish had gone anywhere near.

The driver’s door had also gained 4 large visible scratches/dints that were definitely not there when we test drove the vehicle. Dale’s reply to us not being happy last night was that now they will have to paint it and that they try and do it the easiest way first – easy for who? Certainly not us, who have now got the issue of a vehicle that we are really unhappy with and to have to bring back for additional repair.

Dale has asked that we wait until after the bank holiday weekend as he was away this weekend. We were not happy to wait as we felt that we will just become one of April’s numbers to you.

A date was arranged for the car to be collect and taken for repair. After a week we were contacted and told the car was ready and would be dropped off on the Saturday. Saturday came and the car arrived.

I have never seen such bad workmanship in my life. The door had been painted to the fold lines and badly masked off. And the chips/dints in the door had been painted over without even trying to fill or get them smooth. The rear bumper must have been sprayed outside on a windy day, with dust and bits flying around. You can literally feel the bits in the paint.

I rang the used car sales manager, who informed me he was leaving the business the next day and assured me the guy taking over would be in touch. And it would probably have to go to the Chester branch to get painted properly.

Guess what…… NO CONTACT.

I spent 6 hours polishing and cleaning the car in order to make my very upset wife happy with it. Its still not perfect but a million times better than it was we received it.

We chose to go for another A-Class as the last one that we purchased proved to be a really good experience and I have to say that Macclesfield Mercedes by far outweighs any service received from your dealership. I have also had great service in Warrington.

If this reviews stops one person going to this dealership than its been worth while.

I really didn’t think dealership were like this these days. Especially a prestige brand like Mercedes.

We await the standard reply from Inchcape asking how they can help!"

2019-07-29,1,"My car was put in for service at Coopers Croydon BMW last Tuesday (23rd July 2019) for oil service with microfilter and AC service. However when car returned to me there was significant damaged on the back bumper which was flagged immediately at the dealership which Coopers Croydon admitted liability after confirming that no such damage was present when the car was brought in to them (from their pre-service vehicle inspection record) and their photographic video evidence. One week has since past by and despite phone calls and e-mails they have not responded back as to how they are going to rectify the damage caused by them how they will address the inconvenience they have caused me. I live a 100 mile round trip way from Coopers Croydon. I have always brought my car back to Coopers Croydon ever since purchasing the car from them in 2012 for its servicing/ repair needs. I don't know what has happened at Coopers Croydon, maybe change of management but they simply do not seem to care about their customers like they used to. Customer service has obviously gone very bad. I hope to get contacted with a way forward, the damage to my car is not my fault and its extremely bad customer service to simply ignore and not resolve the problem Coopers Croydon have themselves caused to to my car and the inconvenience I will have to face to get it rectified."

2019-07-26,1,"Well I’m still awaiting the promised follow up by Inchcape customer service team in reply to this message!!!! I wonder whether it’s an automated reply? What a joke!




Up until recently I haven’t had a problem with them but over the last few days the service has been absolutely appalling! I had a puncture (which has been plugged by roadside assistance, RAC who were very good) the engineer told me I should get in touch with my dealer so they can assess the tyre to see whether it can be fixed or whether it needs replacing as I have tyre insurance. I called them on Tuesday and was passed to the parts department who said I needed the services department they couldn’t put me through so I had to ring up again, I went through to services who then put me through without any comment to another automated system where I was cut off. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve rang but at one point I was put through to Ireland who said they’d get the dealer to get back to me they still haven’t. I have just rang again and the phone call was disconnected! Irritated isn’t the word! Unfortunately anybody asking me at this present moment in time what I think of them I would be recommending a different dealer!! I’ve given a 3 because I’ve not had a problem before well except maybe waiting a bit too long for servicing of my car but I can live with that and wouldn’t have brought it up until this happened!!"

2019-07-24,1,"Brought a 3 year old GLA for a pretty large sum of money. Sold as in perfect condition, paid my deposit drove 170 miles to pick it up and even after having a week to prepare the car it was far from perfect. Get a few bits sorted out and eventually sign all the paperwork only to find out it has one key as I'm about to drive off the forecourt. Wasn't told, Not happy. Say they will chase the key down. Week later the car won't start and have to jump it. Thought I'd left something on. But after another day or so I am now forced to jump start the car EVERY time I want to drive it. Ring up say it won't start and it's most likely the battery. Told to book it into a garage and don't worry it will be covered even though their amazing warranty that comes with the car that covered EVERYTHING except the usual wear and tear items like brakes and wipers only to find out they won't cover batteries either. Gary brown at their Burton on Trent branch tells me not to worry I've only just brought the car they will of course sort it. Low and behold warranty company not interested and now all of a sudden Gary never said that to me on the phone and they are willing to contribute half of a battery cost from eurocarparts. Nothing about the diagnosis that THEY requested or for fitting it. Or the fact that he said they would cover it, now I guess I must be the liar. Wonder of they record their calls. Trying to get hold of them now is a joke. Give you the constant run around I assume because they think I'm so far away I won't do anything. I'm sick of the car now the whole experience has been ruined and I'm returning the car on Saturday and expect a full refund as per my statutory consumer rights after being sold a car unfit for purpose."

2019-07-22,1,"To make it easier to digest I will bullet point the reasons for the bad review and the reasons why I feel like mini cooper Norwich missed the expectations I'd expect from a franchised main dealer.

• it took a day longer to have the initial repair carried out and as I did not have a courtesy car on this booking I had to mess around work colleagues in regards to arranging a last minute lifts to work.

• Mark asked me to contact him if the engine light comes back on (which it did by the following day) I spoke to another member of staff who advised I would have to pay £120 for this to be checked before it could be investigated

•Due to the cost and me believing it wouldn't be the egr valve due to it being replaced I went to a BMW mini specialist garage which still cost me £60 they had a brand specific code reader (who's reader could do everything the main dealers could other than reprogram the car) only to find out it's still the egr at fault.

•upon advising yourselves I was told that they must be worng and that it would have to be something else and the tone regarding this only changed when I showed a dated print off with exact codes of the cars faults all relating to the egr valve.

•even with this proof I was still advised that if this wasn't the fault I would have to pay (£120) for this to be checked.

• booked the car in for this and selected to opt for a courtesy car which when I arrived did not have any fuel in it so I had to wait for a member of staff to go to Sainsbury's and put some fuel in the car this caused me to be late for work

I will say I am usually not someone to complain but due to my customer journey being from start to finish being so awful I feel the need too. I believe there was no discretion or common sense used when it came to my case and that while I completely understand your busy as a customer I felt quite frankly forgotten about

Also for a bit of context I have recently brought a home and with a lot of money going towards that I could not justify spending an extra £60 to have you carry out the same job a specialist garage did for half the cost especially since I was under the impression it was not the egr valve (which I spent £420 less that 2 weeks prior) and also prior to booking in for part repair at all a garage did advise this part did need replacing so I didn't feel the need for this to be checked prior for an extra £120

Also I did try raising a complaint before this review at the dealership only to be given a incredibly generic email disregarding my whole complaint."
2019-07-22,5,"I purchased a Renault Megane from Inchcape Bromborough, these people are unbelievably good, the salesman (Tyler) and manager (Mike) couldn't have been more helpful the whole process from start to finish was excellent I can not speak highly enough of their expertise, would fully recommend this company and their staff"

2019-07-19,1,"Inchape VW Southend are good for car servicing only but are not competent with repair, they actually cause damages to my car in their garage when they were trying to repair the alarm of the car, they offer no apology and they lied a lot about lot of things, their service manager is arrogant, rude and unhelpful, once there is an issue he will ignore you and will even threaten you.

2019-07-18,1,"As an update from my june 19th review, being concerned about the competence of the engineer at inchcape IE running the battery down and not replacing the dashboard cover correctly, we took the car to another VW service centre, the car was inspected by their chief engineer and he took photos, the console housing was cracked and damaged, the wiring was chipped and not insulated and screws were not tightened in all a incompetent and bodged repair, the chief engineer has 20 years experience and its one of the most unprofessional repairs he had ever seen, the wires not being insulated will cause an electrical short very rapidly the next heavy shower of rain and this will occur and an engine fire is a definite possibility

so there are only 2 reasons for this to happen A inchcape employs people that conduct a sub standard repair in this case a dangerous repair, or the repair is made this way so it generates another faulty quickly and more cash and more profit for inchcape you decide which it is
when you leave a review with a single star you get a so concerned message from tellusmoreinchcape this is just purely to make readers think the company is concerned, they are not you end up with a customer champion digital, which is a fancy title for someone that works in their customer care department that will side only with inchcape, the issue with the windscreen wipers they contacted the service centre and made an opinion without consulting myself, the images on this review has been sent to them along with a description of the quality of the work their answer is "" i have taken this up with inchcape harold wood ""

A customer champion listens to the customer she did not, no apology, no explanation, no compensation as i had to pay for the cowboy work of inchcape to be corrected, nothing in all pure flannel and fobbing off

My concern is that there are more customers driving cars with substandard repairs, an electrical short in the engine due to the sheer incompetence and malpractice by inchcape is a serious matter,

inchcape is a franchise and they are listed on the stock exchange so profit is king, if they make mistakes they fail to tell the truth if they damage your car you will pay for it, i have spoken to several unhappy inchcape customers all have the same situation, inchcape making blatant mistakes and not admitting it with the customer care backing the company 100% take your car there at your own risk and any concerned people that have had a service or repair should take the decision on having the car checked as i did"

2019-07-15,5,"I've only got good things to say about Inchcape Toyota in Guildford: with about 10 day's notice they'll collect your car, service/MOT it and then deliver it back to you within the day so that you don't have to wait at the garage.

You receive an email with a link to a short video that a mechanic has recorded while the car is up on the lift describing any problems and the state of the tyres, brakes etc. You can then give card payment on the phone and the car's cleaned before it comes back to you.

Not the cheapest way to get a car serviced for sure, but it's not that expensive and the customer service has been great."
2019-07-15,4,"Recall visit for my 330d. Loved the video they sent through showing the underside including tyre tread depth, condition of brake pads, discs etc. Being recall work they would only do on a weekday without a courtesy car and it is a massive dealership so a bit impersonal but otherwise all good"
2019-07-15,5,"While walking to the car after my service I mentioned how happy I was with the car apart from how soft the paint was and how easily bird poo marked it, even when I wash it off as soon as I see it. Showed the chap ( sorry can't remember his name) a mark on the bonnet and rear passenger door which I had tried to get off with compound and polish without success. He asked if I had a bit of spare time and he'd get the body shop to have a look. 15 minutes later got the car back with no signs of the marks I've been trying to polish out for ages. Even better it was all part of the service. Thanks you very much."
2019-07-14,1,"I am completely shocked and upset over the purchase on my new Mini at Inchcape Chelmsford. I was led to believe the car I was purchasing had a particular feature ( sales assistant went on about how great it was!) I went for her recommendation and thought I was going to receive the car I wanted. On delivery it turns out that the car didn’t have the feature .... I immediately let the team know. Initially understanding when they decided they needed to hit the quarter target they said this was never what was ordered and denied having the conversation ! Complained to head office and nothing but apparently the business manager was calling me back ..... Again nothing ...... Totally let down, mislead in the sales process (which was acknowledged by the sales assistant who is not allowed to converse with me or my hubby!) and left with a car I have not ordered !!! I was a returning customer but I will absolutely never ever buy from here again - it has been horrific and I still have no solution ....."
2019-07-13,1,I have had a BMW since 2012 and bought two X3s new. In both cases the sales service was excellent but when it comes to service Cooper Tunbridge Wells are appalling. I have a 2018 X3 which has developed a ‘screech’ when braking in reverse. It occurs when the brakes are warm. Coopers Tunbridge Wells had it for 5 days and failed to fix the problem but DID manage to disable the onboard computer! They suggested I return and wait while they investigate it again - if they cannot do it in 5 days I could not see it could be fixed while I waited! Car booked back in and is currently with them 3 days and counting. They NEVER call to discuss the work they need to do or to tell me when the car is ready. If I call them they do not answer and messages left are not returned. The only way to cope with the dire service is to get a loan car so I am not dependent on them. I totally dread having to get any work done on my car and will not be buying another BMW.
2019-07-13,5,"I had a very positive experience purchasing a year old Touran from Inchcape Southend. Paul and the team treated me well. Compared to some other dealers that I visited, I felt that the quality of vehicle preparation was excellent and the test drive route gave me a chance to try a variety of speeds and road surfaces. The pricing was fair (but firm) and I was offered, but not pressured on, the usual variety of financing, insurance, and additional purchases. If every dealer behaved like this, we'd all feel less dread about purchasing cars - new or used.

I heartily recommend them."
2019-07-11,1,"Absolutely the worst service EVER! Cannot believe BMW can have a service centre like this one. Takes at least an hour to drop off the car. I came in for a routine oil change ... they decided to do the recall on the radiator ... in the process they blew up the computer during the update ... it took them a week to get approval for a replacement ... i was without a car the entire time, and had to physically go into the service centre as no one answers the phone or calls back. Then it took a week for them to get the part from Germany. I took the car back, and it was been three days and I am still waiting to hear back on when can I get my car back ... during checkin they told me it will be one day. RIDICULOUS! Everyone there is surprised how pathetic their service has gotten.

I have a Mercedes as well, and Croydon Mercedes is an absolute charm to work with. Quality of service one would expect from such high-end car manufacturers.

I see they have hired some third party to give standard responses on all the complaints from people. Again, shows how indifferent they are towards maintaining a good level of service.

I love BMW, but this has been an absolute nightmare. Shameful BMW."
2019-07-11,1,"Go to another dealer network. Dealer had my car for 7 weeks for an mot, damaged it in their carpark. Inchape head office wrote to contact them on their review and then after 6 weeks of trying to contact them they have not bothered to return my call or respond to my email. Just garbage. They will probably say hey contact us off the back of this, but then it some void where they don't respond to difficult cases"

2019-07-11,1,"I 2003 I bought my first Mini Cooper from Malton Motors. There were two incidents during the time I had that car. The first was when I got a puncture. I rang the garage to ask advice as I knew the car had run flat tyres on. They asked me to take the car back to the garage and they would have a look. When I arrived they told me that run flat tyres could not be repaired!!. Why couldn't they have told me that over the phone before driving thirty miles!!
The second incident was one occasion when the salesman we were dealing with offered to collect the car to take it in to the garage for a service. This was helpful at the time. The car was returned in the evening by the Body Shop manager as he lived nearby. Our drive was quite steep and he tried to get the car up. As you might imagine the bottom of the car was scraped so had to go back to the garage to be repaired. I would have thought the Body Shop manager would have remembered that a mini is very low!!

In 2015 I bought my next mini, a Mini Cooper S Coupe. The Sales Executive at that time was Chris Goodwin.
As far as I remember there was only one incident with this car.
I got a stone chip on the bonnet and metal strip around the windscreen.I took the car back to the garage as I had taken out extra insurance to cover chips and dents. When I arrived I asked one of the Sales Executives what the procedure was. He had to go and ask as he did not know despite having worked at the garage for two years! When he returned he told me I had to contact the insurance company myself. I was given the impression when I took out the extra cover that any problem would br sorted out at Malton.

Moving on to 2019
I bought a Mini Cooper S Sport, and the real trouble started. After I had had the car for a very short time I decided to have spot lights put on. A little later I decided to have the rear windows blacked out. Obviously I made arrangements to take the car back to the garage to have these things done.

When I took the car back to have the windows blacked out it came to my notice that three of the Sales executives were leaving about the same time, due to the Brand Manager's attitude. This was Chris Goodwin who'd been promoted since I had bought the Mini Cooper Coupe.
I was always under the impression that a manager was there to help, support and encourage their staff. In my opinion customers like continuity and a face and name they know. It says something when the longest serving member of staff is the receptionist!! (Her official title being Service Advisor.)
When the car was in having the windows blacked out it also went into the workshop to sort out a rattle.
As I was leaving the garage much later that evening I noticed a scratch on the rear off side window about two inches long. (Neither the person doing the windows or the staff in the work shop took responsibility, I wonder why.) The person who did the windows had been employed by Malton Mini over a long period of time.
One of the Sales Executives took the car to the Body Shop to see if it could be polished out but was told NO. I was reassured that the problem would be sorted out. I was very upset as the car was only four weeks old by this time.
The following day I received a phone call from the Sales Executive I had been dealing with, telling me that Malton Mini could take no responsibility. I felt it totally unfair that he was left to contact me. Surely having to do that was below his pay grade. In my opinion the Brand Manager should have taken the responsibility for this phone call. I might add that he was day off when the incident happened.
Additionally, in all the visits I have made to Malton Mini he was the only one who did not acknowledge me. All the other staff took the time to chat and were very friendly.

A couple of days later I was sent an email asking for feedback. An extremely poor result was given which prompted a phone call from the After Sales Manager asking why I had given this feedback. After explaining the situation he told me to leave it up to him and he would investigate. About ten days later I had not heard anything from him so rang. he told me the window would be replaced and blacked again. He said he just had to synchronise fitting the window and the guy to black the window. About a further week went by so I rang again. He said it was all go so I arranged to return the car to have the work done. I now have a gorgeous Mini Cooper S Sport. It is only thanks to the After Sales Manager and a bad review online that I have this but I do not feel the service was very good to say the least. I did not really feel I should have had to do the phoning all the time!!!
I think I will go back to Honda in future. I will definitely not be going back to Malton Mini.

2019-07-09,5,"I had a very good experience at the dealership in Nottingham. I would definitely recommend to family and friends about buying a car from this dealership. I was taken care by Yugesh who was very clear and transparent with me about the car and finances during my initial call.

On arrival Yugesh was welcoming and friendly to myself and my brother in law. Yugesh made sure that checks were completed prior to ensure I was able to take the car home on the day of sale, because he was aware that I drove from Leicester and that I wouldn't be able to make another trip. I didn't feel pressured to go ahead with the sale by Yugesh or his manager. I was able to test drive the car and the car was cleaned."
2019-07-09,1,"INCHCAPE YORK.. My mistake was not to read other reviews before purchasing a car from them. After the test drive, paid a deposit for the car and agreed that the door seal will be renewed, scratch on the tailgate will be polished and the car will be valeted. After 4 days I rang them in order to find out the date of picking the car so I can change the insurance date. I was told to come and pick it up tomorrow (Friday). My wife and I went and done all the paper work since the full amount was transferred to Inchcape account the night before when one of their managers told me all the jobs were done and the car is ready.
The first problem was we have to bring the car back to program the SD card for the Sat-Nav. That is an unnecessary additional 70 miles driving for us. We accepted that. Going out with the keys in hand to drive away, we found the car filthy and none of the promised jobs were carried out. The manager was called and he admitted they failed miserably. A catastrophe as one of their sales executives put it. The keys were handed back to them there and then and asked for the money back.
They kept us in their showroom for over 3 hours in the hope maybe we would change our minds and accept the car. It took over two weeks to get the money back with great difficulties. I ended up losing money( insurance swap fees, Registration retainer fees, registration plates etc..) by dealing with Inchcape York.
This company have a culture of never replying to emails and never calling back customers. They are so awful I have never experienced such ignorance on how a business should be run. And if you think one can complain to their head office customer services, well think again, one will be wasting one's time. How this outfit is still operating is beyond me. This is not a poor service, it is beyond poor, it is simply an awful service.
I shall never deal with this outfit again and hope others think twice before doing so."

2019-07-08,5,Service time again (well timing belt actually)... and a big thank you to Donna at Macclesfield Audi. The car was ready when promised and I was given an indication of potential work looking ahead. Very useful.

Hunters (Inchcape) Land Rover York
These guys ripped me off, tried to lie about it and only when I produced recorded telephone calls did they accept responsibility. Instead of an apology I was told my calls would not be admissible in court (which was untrue). It began with a sales rep telling me that if I bought a used vehicle they would put all new brakes on and I thought they had. Took it for a service a year later and they told me all the brakes were dangerous and defective. I HAD TO FIGHT AND PRODUCE CALLS TO GET WHAT I WAS PROMISED! I drove away with new brakes AND THE BRAKE PADS DROPPED OUT!!!! I could have been killed. Air con pully was twittering like a budgie when I left so thought it was just because they had serviced it. Told them and was ignored. Had a garage look at it and it turns out THEY HAD SWAPPED THE AIR CON PUMP FOR A DEFECTIVE ONE. I no longer had air con and still haven't. These guys seem professional on the surface but in reality they are a bunch of crooks! STAY WELL CLEAR AND FIND A BETTER DEALER!"
2019-07-05,1,"Got Suzuki Vitara of which I was paying £375 per month on a car leasing agreement via my works benefits scheme. 2 weeks before I was due to return it I had a small accident of which I had to use through Aviva insurance which was part of the package WHOM THEY CHOSE. I was due to hand car back to Inchcape on 2nd July, but unfortunately the insurance company delayed this due to hold up on repair and I was unable to return car back until today 5th July. I contacted Inchcape on 1st July the day before to advise of change of date & they then advised they would be charging me £183.60 for the hold up, OF WHICH WAS NOT MY FAULT!!! I was then sent on an sea of boomerang phone calls between them and the insurance, both of which do not want to take responsibility of this! I disputed the charge for the additional 3 days, but Inchcape will not budge on this! A shocking end of term service and will not be using them again and recommend no their person does either"

2019-07-04,1,"JLR York what a con. All things ran smoothly on purchasing our used vehicle from them. Bought a few extras. But on collection off the car we didn’t really receive any relevant paper work, so after numerous emails and another visit a week after collection for a few things we had noticed on the car. We than received some paper work on inspection off these I had noticed they had charged me for asset protection which wasn’t even discussed as I was a cash buyer. And also wrongly sold extended warranty as was very persuasive advising we couldn’t take this out at a later date. After contacting the company was told they give you 6 weeks notice for you to take extended warranty out after the approved used warranty is nearly coming to an end. After cancelling these product 3 weeks ago I’m still awaiting a refund of over £1500. Emails and calls being ignored."
2019-07-03,1,"Took my car to the Stockport branch for an MOT and service today... For the last time.

Received the video of my health check saying they couldn't OPEN the bonnet.

Before I even had chance to open the video, a lady called me telling me that the bonnet catch had seized and they wanted to charge me £218 to fix it... LOL. Funny how it opened ok for me a couple of weeks ago. I think Deborah needs some customer service training as she wasn't prepared for me to question it.

I spoke to the 'manager', who wasn't much help either. It had clearly broken under their possession.

Asked them to bring my car back, which they actually did pretty quickly (and the guy who dropped it off was a pleasant lad).

On the inspection sheet the technician had written.. 'Couldn't OPEN the bonnet'... but then scribbled 'OPEN' out and replaced with 'CLOSE'...

Now on trying the release handle it was completely loose, so they have either broken the handle or snapped the cable. This wasn't what was described to me over the phone and it certainly wasn't like this when I last opened it.

Fair enough, these things might happen accidentally... but it's the dishonestly that is absolutely disgusting here and the discrepancies between what was in the video, what the lady told me on the phone, what the manager tried to explain (badly), the comments on the inspection sheet... And for them to think that I would pay £218 to fix a part (THAT THEY HAD BROKEN), which only costs a few quid.

RIP OFF

2019-07-03,1,"I purchased a BMW M-model from BMW Croydon around 2 months ago via their website. The salesman Josh Zarembski dealt with my sale and as the dealership was a few hundred miles away, it was decided that the vehicle would delivered. On delivery, I noticed that the car suffered from major bodywork damage. Examples were things like broken headlights, chunks missing out the tyres, paint chips the size of 10p coins etc. Now bear in mind, I have just bought this vehicle in FULL CASH, I was mortified. BMW claim to meticulously check each approved car, yet here I was with a car that was riddled with damage. Straight away I got onto the phone and they assured me that all would be sorted in due course. A few days later, they tried to book my car into various dealerships around me but had no luck. I offered to take it to a bodyshop near me but on their quotation, their refused. They explained the best way to go about this would be to have the car come back to them. I said, that's not a problem, as long as it's not a driven delivery because at the end of the day, I don't want another 1000 miles added on to the clock, when it was completely their fault. They accepted this and that it would be transported and if any mileage was incurred, I would be reimbursed. As planned my car was collected by some company and then to my horror, driven around and used as their personal car for the next few days. 5 days after the car had left me, it was then delivered to BMW. In between, I had to travel down to Wolverhampton because the tracking system was telling me that the vehicle was left abandoned in some industrial estate. After being on the road for 2 hours, I arrived to find my car parked on double yellows in some estate, despite being told it would be kept in a secure and locked facility by BMW. This was my dream car. Something I worked hard for. I called BMW straight away and sent them pictures. They said nothing could be done as it was a Saturday, but if anything did happen, the company would be liable. I said that's not the point, but returned home annoyed. A few days later the car was then returned to me to find that it was repaired by touch ups. The alloy was replaced with a used one and the tyre had uneven wear. I could drone on for longer but this is the service I recieved. To add to this, the manager DAVID JONES was meant to contact me throughout this whole process but has not done so. No reimbursement for the mileage or compensation for hassle has been offered. No explanation has been offered to why such major damage was missed on release of the vehicle or why my car was used and abandoned in an estate. To add to my horror, the vehicle was advertised as 1 previous owner, but the V5c arrived and showed it had 3 previous owners. Again no explanation offered. Now I am greeted with ignored calls and emails. Truly an outstanding 5 star company at taking your money and leaving you out of pocket"

2019-06-25,5,"Bought a couple of new Range Rovers from this dealership & I think the previous salesman was a bit of a s**t compared to the excellent service & attention I received from Alan Wood of Inchcape, Preston. Nothing was too much trouble or difficult, he kept me updated & was instrumental in giving my wife a hell of a surprise when we staged a Service ‘query’ for the handover & collection of her new car from the Inchcape dealership. Thanks & truly well done!"
2019-06-25,1,"Following an apathetic experience at the local Audi dealership my daughter decided to purchase her Audi TT from VW Chester.
After a waisted visit to test the car (It wasn’t there) previously arranged she eventually did get to test it and made the purchase 25/05/19. It was then discovered that the car was not as advertised and did not have the “Tech pack” that was on the website advert!
Furthermore, after arriving home we discovered there was no tyre compressor and sealant in the tool kit. She was also advised that a missing second ignition key would be collected for her shortly.
During this process I had been in communication with a person from Inchcape following on from my comments regarding the lacklustre Audi dealership. It was arranged for the VW Chester manager to call me (30/05/19) It was explained that the miss represented advert was a mistake and the tech pack could not be retrofitted and to compensate a cheque for a small sum would be sent to my daughter.
However I am aware that the navigation element of the tech pack could installed but was not proffered!
The missing compressor and sealant along with the key were ordered and would be sent to our home. This of course did not happen and further time and limited advice followed! The cheque arrived but it was miss spelt and could not be cashed. Following advice that the parts were available to collect my daughter and I found that only the sealant was there. We were asked “did we not have the compressor” and had we talked to the bank about the cheque?! It felt like we were trying to pull a fast one and I requested to speak to the manager who was not available. After some further discussion it transpires the cheque will have to be re-ordered as would the compressor and likely would take a further five days. The key would go to the Audi dealers in order to be re-programmed as it was not the original! Meantime my daughter drives a car she has paid a not inconsiderable amount of money for without means to repair any potential puncture and still has no second ignition key!
After sales service experience equates to non existence with little by way of an apology. Very disappointing!
Addendum:
Since being asked to contact “Tellus more” and doing so I have yet to receive a reply! Whether this is deliberate, an error or because they are awaiting feedback from the branch in question I do not know but I have now sent a further email to them.
Incidentally the re-ordered second key has been received and formatted etc by the Audi dealership thankfully but the tyre compressor is STILL to arrive !! Strange customer service.
Addendum: Key finally received and working but STILL no reply to my contacting as requested! Plainly disrespectful and deliberately insulting attitude to a paying customer. We still await the tyre compressors delivery to our home but understand it is at the dealers. I would never buy a vehicle from this business and can only say I have never experienced such poor customer after care. BEWARE!"

2019-06-02,5,"We have just purchased a Land rover Discovery Sport from the Inchcape Land rover at Preston. The sales man Alan Wood was so helpful at no time did we feel pressured to buy the car. The before service and after service has been outstanding. Alan sent video of the car we were interested in at the beginning so we could look at it at home, kept in touch with emails and phone calls all the way through. The day we had our test drive was his day off, he arranged and introduced us to Remy to look after us whom he kept in touch with through the day. The negotiations were smooth and trouble free with any points raised were swiftly dealt with by Alan in a very professional way. We would defiantly recommend the garage to anyone considering to purchase a car.
One of the best experiences we have had in buying a car. Thankyou Alan."
2019-05-31,1,"Salesman couldn't care less!

I arranged an appointment with a salesman at our local branch of Cooper BMW (York) after having an argument with a receptionist who misheard me on the phone and then tried to blame me for what she misheard ended up I ended up in the dealership along with my mum. Both of us were looking to buy a nearly new BMW.

After letting the salesman know what my mums top end payment needed to be (through research and not a silly amount) he emerged from his Finance Directors office with an offer £20 higher than her limit. No willingness to negotiate in the slightest. Fail Number 1.

We then came onto looking at my part exchange of a 2 year old BMW. Having had the vehicle valued two months ago, I was told that there was equity in the vehicle then today told that there was negative equity in the vehicle. The excuse being that a new 1 series was being launched in September which has driven the value of the current model down already. I was told my only option was to take further finance out to cover the cost of the new vehicle PLUS the negative equity on my current vehicle. I have since had further valuations which put the vehicle at a break even on the finance!

I can safely say that I will NEVER buy another BMW based on my experience in the dealership yesterday. I absolutely love BMW cars but I cannot deal with salesmen who are not interested in getting deals through and unwilling to negotiate in the slightest.

Safe to say they are clearly not interested in selling either of us a car as we haven't heard anything from the salesman today.... Kinda says it all really!

Since my initial review I have been contacted to ask if I wanted to upgrade my vehicle by another salesperson from the dealership. I have replied stating the above, copying in Inchcape and BMW UK Customer services and received no response. Do not let their replies to this and other reviews fool you, the company clearly cares only about profitability and not even the most basic level of customer service."
2019-05-31,2,"Bought a 3 Year old Tiguan from here without seeing it as it was the right spec / price but i live in York.
When i went to pick up there was Moss/Algae on window seals and door trims, Filthy Alloys and a small scrape which should have been touched up.Also 1 Tyre was borderline 3mm.
I refused to take obviously and arranged to cone back 5 days later when Sales Manager said it would be Pristine.
On return the Algae was still on the door trims so they sent it round back to be washed again and it came back same,with Valeting guys saying they couldn’t get it off!!!!
I got some spit on my thumb and rubbed off a section in seconds!
I said id take the car as i just wanted to get back to York.
Then i find out there is only 1 Key with the vehicle!!
They had 1 on Order but it is unacceptable to tell me literally they were handing over the keys.
Also I would then have to go to my local dealer and pay to get it programmed to my car then reclaim refund from Inchcape!!!!!!
So i did that and 9 weeks and many calls/emails after sending copy of invoice i am still waiting fir my money!!!!!!

NOT GOOD ENOUGH
BUNCH OF AMATEURS
TALK A GOOD TALK

A very disappointing experience

2019-05-31,5,"We had a fantastic experience with Inchcape, particularly with Alan Wood who sold us a beautiful Jaguar. He was very helpful but in a ‘no pressure’ way. He seemed very genuine and went out of his way to ensure we had all of the information we needed and that all of our questions were answered. We bought a used car, so it wasn’t like we were treated well because we were new car buyers... he recognised that the purchase was new to us and made us feel just as important as if we were buying brand new. The process from start to finish was fab! We would definitely recommend! (Ask for Alan!!)"

2019-05-26,5,"Bought a new car from Inchcape Toyota Oxford last week - just wanted to share how pleased I am with it but also the service given to me by the dealer.
The car is AMAZING and I am thrilled with the purchase.
We were looked after by Morgan Barnett-Hunt who was very professional and articulate - he is a credit to Inchcape !"
2019-05-25,1,"AVOID AVOID AVOID

On both occasions ive had dealings with this branch i've been left disappointed by their customer service as a group and BMW as a whole.

In the first instance the suspension gave out on 5 year old car due to a badly designed part, which is an issue with from the point of manufacture and should've been covered by BMW.

The car also developed a water leak in the passenger foot-well, a known issue, but cooper charged me a huge inspection fee on a leak that they knew where the cause was coming from, i in fact told them where but they still had to do a full inspection of the vehicle, with them trying to push minor issues for repair on to me also. This again is a manufacturing fault but BMW will not cover it. This took well over a week for copper to repair and get the car back to me with no loan car available.

Most recently the car has had a EGR unit recall, to which i booked the car in for the day, they said it would only take a day, so after 5 weeks and constant calls to them to chase when the car would be done we eventually got the car back for the Bluetooth to not be working and the USB/media input to not be working. Queue 20 minute call and several connections to different departments to be told it wasn't their fault and a full vehicle inspection at my cost would be required!

I would avoid owning a BMW and Coppers garage completely as they don't know the first thing about communication or service."
2019-05-25,1,"I Have never received such appalling service from a dealership until I recently purchased a used car from Inchcape Jaguar in Chester. Not only did the car have significant mechanical problems with less than 20,000 miles on the clock, the after sales department was/is unbelievably shocking. I can list the appalling experience in great detail. The Head of sales is clearly not interested. I would NEVER use this brand ever again. A truly awful and very frustrating experience. Jaguar Inchape are miles apart from the Excellent customer service I have previously experienced at BMW and Audi dealerships."
2019-05-23,2,"I bought my approved used E class from the Cheshire oaks branch. Unfortunately I live several hundred miles away from that branch. Part ofy purchase included 12 month warranty and an additional 24 month third party warranty. This is where the hassle and problems have crept in.

I'll have had an issue with a part on my vehicle that should be covered under the current warranty. Unfortunately, I have been back and forth with between 2 mercedes Benz branches to get this issue resolved. 2 months later and it has still not been resolved and I have been asked to fork out £250.00. This has obviously been very upsetting and frustrating and has left me never buying from Mercedes again. Previously I wasa BMW owner and I never experienced such unprofessionalism and hastle. Buyers beware and ensure you are getting what you paid for."
2019-05-22,1,"A terrible experience from the after sales team, the issue still hasn’t fully been resolved and I feel ignored since February.
Would not want my car to go back into the Stockport branch for any work as I don’t feel confident with the work or staff involved."
2019-05-22,1,"Appalling! Went to my local garage in Basingstoke. Found a car I liked and had a test drive. Salesman was ok, but when it came to pricing and arranging some finance he said he would have to get back to me the next day. It is now over a month and not heard a thing. Now I have a brand new lovely shiny Ford Fiesta Active - thank you Ford for doing a good job."
2019-05-21,4,The service I received from my initial approach to the company through to purchasing a great motor can not be bettered the care and consideration I received from Mr Alan Wood the salesman that dealt with my purchase was great. He kept me up to date through every step of the process to the final delivery explaining every thing that was necessary along the way. I am very impressed with everything.
2019-05-20,1,"Was looking to purchase brand new Evoque from Guildford branch. Got fobbed off and Inchcape seemed completely disinterested. Despite chasing them, they've still not provided a quote - so clearly aren't bothered about getting new business.

I wouldn't now buy any car from Inchcape if they were the last dealership on earth. If you want a Jag or a Range Rover, use Guy Salmon instead, who were immediately engaging, helpful and responsive."
2019-05-19,5,Having had some issues in the past with my vehicle at Inchcape Preston and given feedback I think it only fair to give positive feedback when deserved. I have changed from a diesel to a petrol evoque and the support and customer service from Alan Wood has been great from the beginning to driving it away. I am very happy with my new purchase and have had my faith restored in Inchcape.
2019-05-18,1,"If you want good customer service then I would avoid using this dealership. There staff are rude and insulting, demanding money upfront for diagnostic service. Made to feel unwelcome, and the list goes on."
2019-05-16,1,"Possibly the very worst service/feedback we have ever received from any organisation. Car went in for a service at Coopers Thames Ditton and to check if it was to be recalled. I was told it needed to be fixed under the BMW recall and would take less than 2 weeks. At no stage did anyone tell me this could or would be longer. 8 weeks later the vehicle was made available to me and at no stage anyone bothered to call me to give me an updated eta on the fix, this was after leaving over 20 messages with the service desk over the period with not a SINGLE response. I called to get hold of the service desk and to try arrange copies of my drivers license for the rental car that was provided (I believe this was at BMWs expense) , the first response took over a week but did not provide the information we needed. As a result my wife (primary driver) was unable to even use the rental car provided which ended up sitting on our driveway unused.

In short, poor communication, complete lack of professionalism, over 2 months without my car and not even a single apology or update over that time. Whilst I appreciate BMW was suffering significant delays in getting the parts, it truly boggles my mind that this organisation never bothered to let me know. To add injury to insult the car had an Mot and it was indicated the battery was flat and I would likely need to replace it (at my expense), but I knew that already as I had stopped receiving updates from the vehicle as it clearly had been sitting idle for the first 4 weeks. I indicated this should be at the dealerships expense at which point the battery situation was no longer discussed.

A real example of how not to treat a customer. This is likely the last time I will ever bother to use their services and I will actively avoid them if I can."
2019-05-14,5,"We have just purchased a car from Inchcape in Preston , we were very well looked after by Alan Wood he was an absolute pleasure to do business with . He helped us choose the right car , he kept in constant contact with updates on when we would get the car . When we collected the car he spent time with us explaining everything and answering any questions we had . He was patient , pleasant and so friendly , we felt like we had known him for a long time . Five star customer service ."

2019-05-13,1,"COOPER BMW COLCHESTER

I have to write in my relation to my recent experience at the above dealership.
I initially attended on the 5th May to enquire about a used 5 series 520d touring. I was dealt with by Nick and using the internet we sourced a suitable vehicle from Cooper York. I agreed a satisfactory part ex price and paid a £500 deposit to secure the vehicle and was told that I would be informed when it arrived.
After a few days and having heard nothing from Nick I phoned the dealership and was told it was due on the Thursday.
Again having heard nothing I drove to the dealership and saw the vehicle parked. It was in a terrible state, partly bald tyre, massive scratches/dent to rear passenger door, gouged alloys and a chunk of tyre missing and numerous other dents.
I entered the dealership and saw Nick who stated he had no idea the car had arrived!
I showed him the vehicle and he then and there agreed to refund my deposit. He said it would be actioned that day. I phoned later the same day as I was beginning to lose faith and he confirmed it had been actioned.
5 days later and no money had appeared in my account so I again phoned the dealer and spoke to a manager called Dan who then and there refunded the amount stating it would be in my account in a few days.
The whole experience has been so disappointing and not worthy of a BMW dealership.
I await the arrival of my deposit but would be wary of using Cooper again."
2019-05-13,1,"Visited this garage on 12.5.19 after booking a test drive which had been confirmed. Upon arrival, the salesmans(J Stannard) attitude from the off was very unprofessional. He assumed it was a done deal and an easy sale and as soon it became clear to him that I hadnt made a final decision as to whether I'd be proceeding he made up some story about his manager having literally just sold the car so we wouldnt be able to take the car for a test drive. Most unhelpful. Save your time and money."
2019-05-09,1,Cooper bmw sunderland vehicle in for service came out with door chipped and low on engine oil keep well away
2019-05-09,1,"My M4, which I bought from Cooper BMW in Thames Ditton, was booked in for an oil service. I called the afternoon before to confirm drop-off time and then at 6:40pm that evening I received the following poorly written text cancelling my appointment. No apology and no call from Cooper since to rebook....very poor...I certainly won’t reply....

good afternoon Mr Evansthis is BMW unfortunately due to technicalissues in the workshop we have to cancel your booking tomorrow we will rebook soonPlease do not reply"
2019-05-05,1,"Drove 3 hours to buy a 8 month old car that the sales manager informed me was immaculate. It wasn't, it looked like it was 3+ years old. His attitude was poor also. Absolutely not the experience you would expect from a Volkswagen main dealer"
2019-05-03,1,"Nothing but bother with Preston JLR. Took car for warranty work three months ago which they agreed needed doing and said they would contact me to arrange bringing the car back in. They didn't. Chased after three weeks to then be told to wait other nine weeks if I needed a courtesy car. They then phoned the day before the appointment to cancel it.

Also, test drives are like something from the 80s. Twenty minutes round the block with a sales person sat next to you!

Think they're a premium brand retailer, but falling far short in terms of customer service. Lots of arrogance."
2019-05-02,5,"I've just purchased a used car from Inchcape in Preston and cannot fault the service from beginning to end - even when the phone lines went down Alan kept me informed as to progress. Despite requiring a fair few extras on the car, and even taking into account Easter weekend, it was ready only 1 week after I first was persuaded to set eyes on it. A couple of very small niggles post purchase have been (so far!) dealt with professionally, with courtesy and good humour. All I could ask for in a car purchase, and I was and remain incredibly impressed."
2019-04-29,2,"Local Mercedes franchise. Was keen to buy an e class estate and the salesman located one in a different branch with the spec I wanted though wrong colour. I agreed to pay £500 as a deposit to relocate the vehicle 20 miles approx though I didn’t expect to be told that I’d be expected to clear the purchase in two days because of end of month sales figures. This led to me being presented with a sales order to sign. I requested a written statement to say that if I didn’t want the car, regardless of confirmed description I would receive my deposit back.
I was looking to pay in full but was told that if I took pcp I would receive two years extended warranty ( worth £1250 approx) and that if I just paid off the pcp after ten payments it would be like getting the warranty for approx £150 as that would be the interest I’d have paid! £30,000 at 10% interest per annum for 10 months is never going to be £150. I felt this to be very misleading.
Car viewing didn’t start well.. damage to rear bumper and front grille. I rceived varied descriptions of how they were minimal and that they’d by touched up, sprayed, heated or filled and then sprayed but I’d never know the damage was there! Oil too full warning light came on too and I was told to cancel errror messages as they were not important. Afraid that I lost all confidence in any sales here and yet the guys all seemed friendly enough if a little pushy and typical car sales (shame for a Mercedes dealer).. after saying I wasn’t interested in the car I was left alone at a table in the sales room for 25 minutes. Eventually I was told that the ‘finance’ team were in a meeting and couldn’t be disturbed. My credit card number was taken on a post it note so let’s see if the payment happens

I await my deposit return keenly..

Real shame as I’m very disappointed that I’m probably unlikely to buy a Mercedes now.

Update 1st May.
Wrote an email to them as requested in their response and guess what. Nothing.

Deposit repaid.

4th May. Still no response. Guess that shows their commitment to customer care.

14th May. Still no response from my mail to Inchcape. However I did get a letter from Mercedes Benz warranty congratulating me on my purchase of the vehicle (correct reg as per car that I’d viewed and rejected). I had to call them to insist I hadn’t bought the car. I called the dealer but was told there was no manager available to speak. Strange.
Be careful with this dealership. I still like the cars but would not consider purchasing here."
2019-04-29,2,"We write a first bad review here because of a lack of interest and concern from Inchcape with respects to our complaint dated 27 February 2019, which still has not been dealt with as we requested. Our complaint was against the outfit Inchcape put us onto when we purchased alloy repair insurance with them, Care Care Plan and DWV, which reflects badly on them. We then received a reply from Inchcape here in trust pilot and we then sent them the email trail and they are are still uninterested in assisting us, it’s been 5 days and they are happy to delay us even further and are not interested in helping us, preferring to wash their hands of this problem. We remind them that under the Provision of Services Regulations 2009 traders are underva legal duty to respond to consumer complaints as quickly as possible and to make their best efforts to resolve those complaints but Inchcape are only interested in passing on responsibility to Care Care Plan, the people, we have described to Inchcape, who have caused us a lot of problems. The responsibility lies with Inchcape, we had no choice in who we wanted to fix our alloys when we purchased an expensive car alloy repair insurance from Inchcape, therefore the responsibility is all Inchcape’s and all we are asking is that they provide a better level of service in return for the money we paid for the insurance and respecting our requests to have our alloy repair insurance transferred to a more courteous, professional and competent repair service who have a duty of care to their customers, something I cannot say for Inchcape c Car Care plan and DWV."
2019-04-28,1,"Substandard service from beginning to the end.. No communications whatsoever.. Cannot reach service dept. by phone.. broken promises... and when I wrote to both customer services at Thames Ditton and Inchcape... total silence!
Like other reviewers they cancelled my loan car day before appointment by a text message. I was told car will be ready same day and they will call me and drop the car off. No phone calls.. could not reach them... went to collect my car late in the evening when I was told my car's gone off site for MOT and it wasn't there!! Next day promised to drop my car off to my house as I was working late and unable to pick it up myself.. again car never materialised. At the end my car wasn't even washed or cleaned. Total incompetence from top to bottom. Will not trust them with my car ever again. BMW should really take notice of all these poor reviews and take action against this franchise."
2019-04-25,1,"Coopers at Cobham, Surrey
sequence of events:
-booked my X1 car in 2 weeks ago for Thurs 18/4, for some minor warranty work (rattle from boot which I believe is the rear boot locking mechanism)
-brought the car in Wed 17/4 lunchtime, so they could get an early start on it Thurs (keys given to service reception and I signed the paperwork) I was told to expect a call on Thurs.
-at 5.45pm I called your service dept (as I had had no contact), I was told my service manager would call back.
-6.15pm still no contact so I called again, and again told I would get a call back before 6.30pm . I said I would probably pick car up on Friday and asked was service open on Good Friday, I was assured it was 10am to 4pm.
-I did not get a call back
-Fri 10.20am I called service, only to be told service was closed for the day
-Sat 10.15am I called service again, and was told I would get a call back (I explained I needed my car Sat afternoon).
-at 11.30am I called again, as once again I had not had a call back. I was told again someone would call me back. I said I was coming to collect my car and would be there at 12.30pm. I did not get a call back.
-when I arrived at 12.30pm Ellie explained that my car had not been looked at .
Needless to say I drove my car home.
Had someone called me Thurs pm and said ""sorry we have been unable to look at your car due to XYZ"" then I would have be disappointed but accepted it happens in life.It would have taken someone 2 minutes to make that call.

Two wasted journeys for me and my wife (to bring me home, and take me back to Cobham), several phone calls, several failed promises Tomorrow I travel abroad with the car for 3 weeks and will have the annoying rattle the whole trip.

2019-04-24,1,A customer of what was Hunters Land Rover in Preston. Salesman told us he would throw in free insurance products given it was his first Range Rover Sport deal. Shock to find out I owed over £500 on the insurance product once I settled the finance on my vehicle. Not explained from day one nor was I given the option to purchase. Will never step foot in their showroom again
2019-04-24,1,"Great sales but awful after sales service. Told for 2 years a skipping issue on my car was due to ""winter tyres"" after which point Mercedes HQ advised it was the wheel knuckles. Driving around in an under performing car for 2+ years it took 4 separate pre- booked visits to get the issue, arrived on each occasion to be told there are no parts. No one bothered to advised and it took 3 months to get the issue finally fixed.

At the same time the sensor were faulty and i was advised they had been fixed, no surprise they hadn't fixed the sensors and it took 4 separate phone calls the final one being to the customer service manager to get the car re-booked in. which was today and i've just been advised again that they don't have the parts to fix it.

Awful service, each time you wait 30+ minutes to even hand over your keys.

They also charge £1000 excess on loan cars so be very careful. Although they've just waived that as a ""gesture of good will"".

First and last Mercedes i'll buy, great looking cars, terrible performance and service."

Dave, to be specific, quickly diagnosed the issue, which no other Mini Cooper Garage in London could find, and came up with a strategy to fix the problem without breaking the bank. He also met with me when I picked up my car to talk me through everything he had done. I highly recommend this Mini Cooper garage! I'd give them 6 stars, if possible!!"
2019-04-23,1,"Be very very careful when dealing with Inchcape Cheltenham about the pricing of their secondhand vehicles. My 19 year old daughter went in to test drive a 3 year old Polo priced at £9,481 and was told to go away and come back another time to test drive it - so she came back the following week with her Mum (me) and test drove it and when we went to do the ""deal"" the price of vehicle was £9992.00 an increase of £511 in 5 days !!!!!!!!!! And you would think they would honour the price as we had photographic evidence of the price on the windscreen and they had turned her away to test drive on the first visit but no customer service and trust means nothing to them - will not be using them again and will have the car serviced some where else - so no repeat business

Update -pick car up yesterday and guess what mot mentions stone chips on windscreen and my daughter is expected to sort it out herself and now her insurance company want to charge her £30 and the hassle of getting it done - unbelievable that she paid £10k CASH and she is given a car and told to sort the windscreen out herself - they never mentioned this until I read it on the MOT - unbelievable arrogant dealer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and please don't tell me to email direct because you don't get a response back - does anyone care about treating customer better!!!!!!!!"
2019-04-22,1,"Very poor over all experience. Would NOT recommend. Got a brand new car, within a week it was back and needed a new hand break. The staff never contact back when they say they will. Even when I complained on here I had to chase it up and to call the Inchcape number it cost a small fortune to phone.
The car squeaks, there's a clanking sound when I go over bumps. They told me it was booked in for a 'complimentary health check' and when I called to clarify the time and date, as I had not heard anything the week before, they hadn't even booked in the car and I was told it was my fault that I hadn't booked it!
I was also told that I need to 'think of it this way, if I have had these issues now, the likelihood something else will go wrong is very slim'. The car was a WEEK old.
Fair enough they gave me some petrol, a valet and some vouchers to promote THEIR company but I want a reliable car.
Would not recommend this company at all, poor customer service over all all the way from the branch to head office as I was told it was just one of those things that can happen and that sometimes some customers need a new engine after a week. So she was basically saying needing a new hand break is nothing. Joke of a company and attitude towards their customers."
2019-04-22,1,"The staff are always very pleasant, but seem to live in perpetual chaos, which inevitable means that you will be disappointed on one or more fronts. I took my car in for an MoT on 18th April at the agreed 8.30. It was moved in the morning to somewhere at the back of Esher. ~It was then collected about 1.30 and driven back to Cobham. It was moved again, albeit about 20 feet, at about 2.30. It was only at 5.45 when work began and this was 15 minutes after I arrived to pick it up. Luckily it passed, goodness know what they would have done if it had failed. It eventually was given back to me at 6.30 and on this occasion washed (something missed on the previous 3 visits), which I suspect was because I had there service advisor write on the job ticket ""make sure it is washed before returning"". Their sky high prices would be more palatable if you got a high quality service, but you don't."

2019-04-17,2,"Purchased a one year old BMW from Cobham BMW in February and they were more interested in selling add ons than looking after my needs as a customer. When I asked about the road tax I was told it would be included on the invoice and they then let me drive home in an untaxed vehicle, which I then discovered was in a much higher bracket to what was discussed. I found after sales service to be very poor, once the sale is completed then there is no customer care. I would not use this dealership again."
2019-03-29,1,"Absolutely Appalling, Picked a brand new DS up and it was filthy with a big scratch on the bonnet. The car has been back to the garage twice and they still can not fix a noise problem. They leave rubbish in your car when they have it, don't bother washing it and you still had to wait nearly an hour just to get your keys. Was told a manager would call never did! When you call them to ask to speak to a manager, they palm you off saying they will call you back but they don't!!! When you pay a lot of money for a car you expect decent Customer service. Landrover have really gone down hill, I will never use Chester Inchcape Landrover again. Stay away and use a better dealership or another company altogether!

On the 31st Mar 19 I was asked to send my details into inchape so I did. A week later they still haven’t been in touch. I stick to my first and last comment! Absolutely Appalling, stay away!

No response or communications whatsoever despite escalation to BMW UK. Apparently consumer law does not apply to this dealership? Now will be taking legal action.

We were that incensed with our experience that we have traded our Discovery Sport and will never have another Land Rover nor deal with Inchcape ever again."
2019-03-25,5,Excellent service from beginning to end from Kyle and the car arrived early!
2019-03-24,3,"The scoring has been based on the overall experience as the initial contact prior and during making an order with the dealership was excellent. There was a several month wait between placing the order and actual delivery during which time I had several questions, however, unfortunately once the order had been placed it was difficult to contact the salesman and emails and calls were either not returned or were very slow in being responded to. I highlighted my dissatisfaction regarding this to the dealership for which they did apologise. The actual handover of the car went very well apart from identifying a small amount of damage to the steering wheel which had happened prior to the handover. The salesman at this point took a photograph on his phone prior to the car leaving the dealership on collection day and assured me that this would be sorted out. I followed this up with an email to the dealership copying In the salesman and manager the following Tuesday asking for an update or likely timescale for this to be resolved. I then had a call advising that I would definitely receive a further call on Friday (3 days later) to give me an answer on how/when the steering wheel would be fixed. Friday has come and gone and it is now Sunday night. Surprise surprise no call or email has been received to update me on the outcome. I had been disappointed with the lack of response contact with the dealership prior to car collection however as they had redeemed themselves at the time of handover i had been prepared to give them a higher score. However, unfortunately they have let themselves down once again by not making the returned phone call as promised and therefore resulting in a dis satisfied customer."
2019-03-24,3,The whole experience was quite frustrating. From communications to the completed service it has left me unsure of whether I would wish to use Cooper Chelmsford again
2019-03-24,3,"Average sort of experience, I contacted garage re a mini we liked, got a valuation of my wifes car to trade in over phone, a little haggling, got a bit more offered and we agreed to attend , swop and do the deal.
Normal car buying process, cup of tea, sign documents, swop cars.
Three minor issues would have liked to have been better;
.
1- On getting into car saw what I thought was a small peice of dirt on the windscreen, grey showery day and on arriving home when it was dark went to rub it off to find it was a small crack in the windscreen, reported this next day to garage as concerned it could spread or possibly fail a future MOT with it.

Poor response really, reply received that garage had completed its BMW check and nothing noted on it then... small crack, (and I accept it could have easily been missed), but no offer to rectify on a £14,400 car biught less than 24 hours earlier and from a large bmw dealership, instead just advised to contact Autoglass who would repair it for free?
Did just that, was lucky, firstly that Autoglass worked with my insurer, secondly that they would agree to do it as on explaining operator stated I had informed it was there on buying therefore not really insurers to bear the cost of... but they kindly did... except there was a £10 cost to us which I advised the garage of but no offer to reimburse made nor even acknowledgement of email.

2- Washed car yesterday, checked under bonnet to find coolant level BELOW minimum, no leaks from radiator or marks on driveway therefore reasonable to assume that coolant level had also had same quality of BMW checking applied to it before sold to us!

3- Car came with no floor mats, advised of this at time, looked on Mini website - all weather package showed as £100 for front, rear and boot all in rubber, asked if any discount on same, advised 15% decided to buy, still came to £114, 15% discount not applied.
Full set of mats not in stock, only front- not a problem, others would be posted, still waiting for same 9 days later.

All in all an average experience and to be expected but felt let down by the above points."
2019-03-23,3,I bought a car from an independent dealer. The iDrive stopped working suddenly. I contacted the service team and the initial consultation was very good. I booked my car in for a diagnostic. When I brought the car in a different person checked me in and he made me feel embarrassed for having bought the car from an independent dealer. I'd go as far as to say he was rude. When I went to collect the car the service I received from a different person was great.
2019-03-23,5,"Great experience from start to finish. Andrew, Steve and Ollie from Sales made the whole process so easy and their professionalism, enthusiasm and great customer service changed my experience of the murky world of car buying. Would highly recommend if buying a new Land Rober or Range Rover."
2019-03-22,5,"A big thanks to Cheshire Oaks Audi for the superb service I received when I took my A4 in this week. As always I found the team welcoming, professional and knowledgeable. The coffee wasn’t bad either."
2019-03-22,3,"Having booked my car in for a service, I had to wait 25 minutes before being seen. Meanwhile the parking out side was, as usual, ridiculous. My wife, who was waiting to pick me up, had to move three times as there was just not enough space for the number of cars. Once checked in, the service was completed when I was told it would be and the car was well cleaned when I picked it up. They seemed to have too few staff and too many cars for the site."
2019-03-22,5,The staff at Cooper Cobham Mini particularly Harry were brilliant when we went to chose our Mini. Helpful and friendly and a great choice of Minis
2019-03-22,5,"5 stars: Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone."
2019-03-22,5,Excellent service.
2019-03-22,5,"After sitting through my Mam’s experience with Cooper Durham I knew I wouldn’t be disappointed with the teams efforts, they pulled out every stop for her which is exactly what they did for me! I met Megan, Ellie and Mark during the 2 appointments I was there and thanks to them I now have a gorgeous Mini Cooper.

I worked closely with Megan to find my perfect car, she was very friendly, attentive and efficient. She found my car quickly and within 2 weeks it was sat on my drive. Within those 2 weeks it had been transported, I’d had a test drive of it and it had a full check and clean. Megan explained everything thoroughly and was able to answer every question I threw at her. Although the car had a large mark on the seat she ensured it had completely gone before I picked it up. She made me feel very confident and relaxed about the entire process. I drove away a very satisfied customer and would recommend her to anybody!

Thanks again for a lovely car!"
2019-03-22,5,"I bought my car from Inchcape Jaguar in York. The whole experience was excellent. Tom Bond was down to earth, relaxed and put no pressure like a lot of salesmen would. After care service has also been great. When it’s time to change I will be going back again. Car is amazing as well :)"
2019-03-21,5,Brilliant service and a good deal very impressed
2019-03-21,5,They were obviously very busy on the day I had my Mini serviced but the job was completed as expected and on time.
2019-03-21,1,I use the inchcape Dealership In Bolton Greater Manchester and there perfect about a year ago someone bumped my car while it was parked up took it into inchcape and was told that the repair centre had left panels off underneath and had not done a great job of the repair and was told if I needed help in the future to use them . Car parked up again someone reversed into my car so I told insurance that I wanted to use these only and as it was a non fault etc. It was collected not on a low loader as my insurance told me it would be when they took the car the tank was full when it came back it was just under 3/4 of a tank and the repair is awful the paint looks like orange peel and the overspray is a mess. i contacted them they offered me a vw polo when am 6ft8. I EVEN sent an email to there MANAGING DIRECTOR STEFAN BOMHARD had email back off lady who said that the bodyshop were sorting it for me no Andrew wanted me to drive my car to near stockport and me to wait there while you sorted your rushed job. I AM NOW Looking to move to a non inchcape dealership to maintain my car service/repairs etc and I will not be buying my next car from you in a bout 16 months time feel like I have been treated like crap and when you do email call your just fobbed off feel so sad writing this review as I say BOLTON INCHCAPE are wonderful however how I have been treated by INCHCAPE BODY SHOP AUDENSHAW has not been a Pleasant experience.
2019-03-21,5,Could not thank Tim and the other staff involved in my used Jaguar purchase enough. From 1st contact to hand over a 100% positive experience. Would not hesitate to recommend Tim Watson to any one looking to buying a used Jaguar.
2019-03-21,5,"Henry from Cooper BMW Chelmsford was a delight to deal with, gave exceptional advice and very efficient after sales service.
A rare find these days in the cut throat world of second hand car sales."
2019-03-20,5,Staff are friendly and attentive. My car was returned beautifully cleaned and with a free maintenance check. That exceeded my expectations.
2019-03-20,5,Was introduced to Nick Hawkins at Inchcape via a colleague. Not our local dealer as I live in Essex. Never been easier to buy a vehicle .. Nick was great. Good swift handover on the day .. so a drive to Norwich wasn't going to be a problem. thanks Nick
2019-03-20,5,"No hard sell and I was treated respectfully which hasn't always been the case in other showrooms (Ford, you have a lot to learn).
Customer care throughout was really very good.
I was treated as well as someone spending as much on an i8Roadster rather than the used car I purchased!
The car is fantastic too."
2019-03-20,5,Relaxed and a no pressure experience
2019-03-20,3,This dealership had a big range of cars available should the car I reserved not be suitable for me and the car that I bought I have been happy with. The reason for 3 stars was that when I looked at this car on line it was showing one price and when I reserved the car and got to the dealership the screen price was £300 lower and despite the salesman's efforts Inchcape would not honour the lower price. The excuse was poor as to why they had not updated the screen price was that they do not have time to update their prices when Inchcape update the prices for each dealership. What I ask is why did they not have time to do this when I phoned ahead to say I was coming to the dealership to look at the car but they had time to clean it and make it look great for me to see. I bought the car in spite of this but it still feels like I was cheated by Inchcape.
2019-03-20,5,Peter was really helpful and welcoming. I’m very happy with my new car and the whole process went very smoothly.
2019-03-20,5,"Brilliant service from the new York Jaguar showroom and workshops. Excellent service from the front of house staff all of whom are friendly and helpful.
Dropped off the car for service and MOT and then a 15 minute walk to the cinema. Watched a 2 our film and returned to dealership for a short wait while vehicle was cleaned and ready to drive away."
2019-03-20,5,on time both starting & completing the job.
2019-03-20,5,"Great service, nothing was too much trouble."
2019-03-20,5,"Very nice dealership, attentive salesperson in Sam. Managed to get a decent deal on on ex demonstrator I Pace, very pleased with my purchase"
2019-03-19,3,Overall ok experience but was kept waiting to pick up my car when told it was ready. I appreciate the processes in place but there are a range of staff all who are not mechanics so there seems a lot of handoffs when all you want is to pick up your car.
2019-03-19,5,The staff are always very helpful and accommodating. I fully recommend using them and my vehicle never fails to come back pristine!
2019-03-19,5,"A very welcoming showroom (Malton Inchcape) with a friendly, knowledgable and professional team who work well together and have excellent customer service skills. Our first experience of ‘Mini’ and we have been very impressed."
2019-03-19,1,Faulty t roc getting info off the service team is nothing short of chronic Its already been in for a day and now they've had 2 days Keep promising to phone me back but dont vw Oldham crap
2019-03-19,4,"This time, much better service than previous occasion with previous Mercedes C Class Coupe when I have had to wait too long to hand the car over and even longer for the member of staff to appear to take payment and hand car back to me.

This time: prompt, courteous service, and clear explanations.

Gearbox problem investigated in addition to Service but no fault found so may need to return for further investigation. Reserving judgement on this one!"
2019-03-19,3,"Booked my MOT online for 10.15 and decided to wait. We were told it would take an hour and a half.
By 10.45 the car was still parked in the parking area. So we went for a walk and returned by 11.50 only to be told we'd have to wait as our time slot had been double-booked. How this can happen with online booking I can't understand.
We were told it would take another 20 minutes but in the end it was 12.30 before we had the car back.
We were kindly offered a price reduction due to the delay.
But, come on MB, you are supposed to be class outfit. Make sure time slots can't be 'double-booked' and keep your customer informed of what's happening."
2019-03-19,5,"Flawless and professional service. Customer service was brilliant, efficient and informative. Would highly recommend!"
2019-03-19,5,"I previously had dealings with another Jaguar dealer closer to home (one that isn't in the Inchcape group). It was a disaster, it almost put me off ever buying a Jaguar and running over to the Volvo showrooms. I fortunately called Inchcape Derby simply to ask how they would have handled things given the same circumstances. I was very impressed by the way the call was handled and the information provided, nothing was too much trouble. It was so good in fact that I ended up buying a car from them. Right along the whole process all my questions were answered, my phone calls were all taken (or promptly returned) and emails answered the same day. In fact the exact opposite of my experience with the previous dealer. It is my feeling that you can safely put yourself in the hands of this company whose business ethics far surpass any car dealership I have ever dealt with in the past, you will not be disappointed. Enjoy the experience."
2019-03-19,5,Excellent service. I went for a recall but they managed not only to check it for free but also to clean it and I have not asked for it. ;)
2019-03-19,5,"All staff friendly and informative. Service was done quickly, and was happy to wait, with unlimited tea / coffee on tap!
Special thanks to Wayne my service advisor."
2019-03-19,5,A most enjoyable handover from Sebastian Spitz and all involved
2019-03-19,5,"A great experience. Did exactly what they said they would do. Kept me up to date with how everything was going, great communication."
2019-03-19,5,Car returned clean and services. Excellent service and good communications throughout.
2019-03-19,5,Great service
2019-03-19,5,Found Blake to be very helpful and was obviously enthusiastic and knowledgeable about Jaguars.
2019-03-19,5,"The Mercedes-Benz dealership in Coventry is how all dealerships should be. I recently took my car there for a routine service and found the whole experience to be highly efficient, professional and extremely customer focussed. A service manager went through the work that was to be done and asked if there were any other things I wanted them to check. A very clean loan car was provided for my use while the work was done.

When I went to collect the car I was informed what work had been done and that there were no problems found. Non-service items I had mentioned had all be attended to as well. The car had been valeted and was brought to me in the enclosed customer service area to drive away a very satisfied customer."
2019-03-19,5,Excellent service for a recall. Video report and valet.
2019-03-19,5,Tom from Mercedes-Benz of Nottingham has been great from start to finish. Everything was made easy and catered for all my needs with buying a new car. I would highly recommend the service.
2019-03-19,5,Matt Downing and Steve Orton were both very helpful and professional at all times. I would definitely recommend dealing with either of them.
2019-03-19,5,Great staff from drop off to vehicle collection. Particularly Emily and her colleague who booked the vehicle in.
2019-03-19,5,Service and MOT completed within estimated time whilst keeping me informed of progress and items requiring attention
2019-03-19,5,"Definitely would recommend Mercedes Benz Warrington.

As soon as I visited I was greeted and straight away was able to have more of a browse and discuss more of the options.

As a first time buyer of a Mercedes, I only went in to the store with basic knowledge, however, after talking with one of the Sales Executives, Ash Alli, I was informed with more information which definitely helped.

Ash really helped guide me in what would be the best deal and choice, without the help I wouldn’t of known where to start.
All the staff are excellent and friendly and kept in contact along the way when waiting for my car.

The Sales Manager Iain came out to introduce himself if I ever need any help, as well as the Sales Manager Ash too.

Excellent experience with the staff and would definitely recommend."
2019-03-19,5,"I was pleased with the service and advised I received from u.
Many thanks.
Mr Bangura."
2019-03-19,3,"Our service was only supposed to be about 1.5 hours but turned into over 4 hours. I understand there was a problem with getting something off our car to do the job but it seemed like it dragged out a really long time and a lot of time could have been saved. Didn't seem to be enough customer service bods as our one was rushing around constantly and talking very fast, it was hard to understand him sometimes. It wasn't a good experience. They did clean the car nicely though so happy with that."
2019-03-19,5,Car service only. Not much can go wrong you might think. I was kept informed of progress and car clean and tidy on pick-up.
2019-03-19,5,"Following an accident that wiped out my Range Rover I was in a position to replace it but unable to travel to see cars. The team at Kings Lynn (Kevin and mostly Georgia) were incredibly helpful, even tailoring videos for me to look at certain aspects of the car to help me decide based on me wanting to see the boot area in detail and other areas the photos didn't highlight. When I purchased it was very smooth and easy, everything clearly explained and delivery was arranged to me due to my inability to travel. First class customer service throughout."
2019-03-18,5,"Bought Mercedes GLA from Liverpool dealership. No fuss, no problems, no false promises and no hard sell.
Gary was honest and extremely helpful.
Won’t hesitate to recommend to friends and family and would definitely go there again."
2019-03-18,1,"Cooper Teesside Mini - will never buy a car from here again. Approved used (overpriced) mini delivered in horrendous condition. Bumped, scratched, broken radio, smashed speakers and door cards. We couldn’t believe it. Forced them to take the car back and repair. 4 weeks later and after a soul destroying amount of phone call to them for updates etc we have the car back, in pretty much the same condition. Now refusing to repair and claiming they were never made aware of some of the issues. An official complaint was made over 5 weeks ago to which I have only today received an unhelpful response. All of this made worse by rude and inadequate staff."
2019-03-18,5,Top quality vehicle and an enjoyable buying experience with a friendly and competent sales team. Many thanks!
2019-03-18,5,"We had the first inspection service on our Mini Cooper S and we were looked after by Tom Clark, he dealt with us in a very friendly and professional manner as did all the other members of staff we met while waiting for the service to carried out.
Overall a very pleasurable experience.
Brian C."
2019-03-18,1,2nd email now sent with still no reply and all my contact details have been sent. Please don’t email back stating the email address because I have the correct one.
2019-03-18,5,"For the first time, I purchased a car blind, only seeing it for the first time when I collected it, I must say the car was spot on, 6 months old and 5,000 miles, the car was as new not a scratch or blemish anywhere and I have a very critical eye, I would recommend this company to anyone."
2019-03-18,5,From start to finish great service exceeding expectations. The salesman Glyn Hind went more than the extra mile all the way through.
2019-03-18,5,"My mini went in for a service and came back sparkling clean. The mechanic had even set my clock correctly as it has been running 4 minutes slow! Great attention to detail, friendly and very helpful."
2019-03-18,5,"We recently purchased a Mini Paceman from this dealer, Jack was very helpful and informative, would definitely recommend this company and are very happy with the car :)
Thanks Jack"
2019-03-18,5,Very friendly and helpful unlike some other dealerships I've dealt with.Also got a very good deal.
2019-03-18,5,First class service at Cooper BMW Reading. Been treated like a king and the process of buying a car there was very pleasant. Never been this easy to buy a car as here. Kudos!
2019-03-18,3,"A complimentary car wasn't available (although booked a specific date for this and later than I would have liked), they offered a taxi to get home and dropped the car off but had to ferry between work meetings on the bus during the day."
2019-03-18,5,"Very knowledgable, helpful and professional staff, was a pleasure dealing with them."
2019-03-18,3,"Centralised service booking leaves much to be desired, especially in answering calls in a prompt manner (i.e less than 10 minutes). This lack of promptness also seems to be carried over very well into the dealership, as kept waiting 15 minutes just to ""book in"". On a brighter note, actual work carried out seems good and car cleaned nicely also."
2019-03-18,5,"Excellent buying experience, no pressure from very knowledgeable sales person. Day of collection was seamless and relaxed. Would definitely recommend. The only thing that spoilt the experience was receiving a letter from Mini/BMW (not the dealership) two days after sale congratulating me on my purchase but was addressed to someone other than me but at my address. This is not a good customer experience."
2019-03-18,2,"I do not expect to wait 20 minutes to drop off a set of keys. especially when I was the only person at the reception desk
The receptionist should be able to accept the keys on behalf of the service dept for a pre-arranged re-call repair.
I also found them quite pompous and unhelpful"
2019-03-18,5,"Recent purchase of a 4 series from Coopers Sunderland. The only downside to this review is I can only give 5 stars, the whole experience was that good !!! Competitively priced dealer with staff that can't do enough for you. Steve and Craig were both fantastic.
I travelled over 300 miles to use Coopers and would/will do the same again. Already recommended them to a few."
2019-03-18,4,"My whole experience taking my GLA to Inchcape for its service was really good with one exception,so the greeting was fine,all very friendly,helpful and professional.my car was ready a good half hour sooner than they told me,so was a nice surprise to be on my way home sooner than I thought.The service was explained to me very well and any questions I had were answered more than satisfactory,but sadly the only downside was the mini clean / valet at the end of the service.In my opinion this was not a good way to end as my car is black and so perhaps needs a extra few minutes to dry than most other colours so I drove away with unsightly streaks all over,so for me the car was ready sooner than they said,but that extra time could have been spent on presentation,other than that everything was perfect."
2019-03-18,5,"Always a pleasure at MINI Norwich, nothing is too much trouble and everything is done to ensure an enjoyable experience. I'm so pleased I have a Mini; the after sales care you receive is second to none."
2019-03-17,2,"I bought a used C200 from Inchcape MB Oxford in October 2018. A day after 90 days and less than 2000 miles the main service light came on. After much arguing the general manager agreed to pay for the service which was nearly £600. When I took the car in for the service I said to the service manager that I could smell petrol when the car starts in the morning. The cause was due to the fuel pipe having raptured and thinking about this now the smell was there when we bought the car. They charged me to repair this at my cost for £200. The exterior petrol flap would not close properly that I asked to get it fixed. Again an existing fault when I bought the car. They wanted another £200 to change the outer casing. In a nutshell this dealership is run very poorly and no after sales service once they have concluded the sell. I would never recommend this to anyone to buy a car from them. I trusted MB too much that being a franchised dealer I would be looked after. If you do then get it RAC/AA checked as this garage will do the minimum if they can get away with it. I wrote to the general manager and after nearly 4 weeks I have had no response. It all starts with management to sales and service, all are bad as each other."
2019-03-17,5,"I can honestly say that the experience of purchasing my new car from Mini at Reading was the best experience I have had purchasing any vehicle. We were updated weekly by Ian Kelly, the Sales representative whose service was A1."
2019-03-17,5,Good experience
2019-03-17,5,"Very impressed with the customer service and efficiency of the Service Department at Inchcape VW in Swindon. The online booking for my vehicles 30000 mile service was easy and I received the necessary confirmation emails prior to the service date.

My Service Advisor was James Godwin and he was fantastic throughout the morning. Courteous, polite, efficient and explained everything in detail. I had a 'while you wait' appointment and worked from the Hotel next door. James kept me up to date on the service and the works that were required on the vehicle. I was in and out in just over 2 hours.

A very efficient service from James and all the team at Inchcape VW. I would have no hesitation recommending them."
2019-03-17,5,"Very helpful, friendly and professional. Would recommend to anyone."
2019-03-17,5,Efficient and helpful with advice without being pushy on advisory items
2019-03-16,5,"The whole service process was conveniently planned for us with the car being collected from our home, We were supplied with a video record of the inspection and a report of the engineer's findings of works required. Where there were works which had not been anticipated, we were given a price for these works and asked to advise whether or not we wished them to be done. The car was returned in good time in excellent handover condition having been thoroughly valeted throughout. Excellent service."
2019-03-16,5,Very very satisfied with every aspect of purchasing my Mercedes Benz from Mercedes Benz North Wales.Would recommend any one looking to purchase one of these great cars
2019-03-16,2,"I can't fault BMW itself and I am more than pleased with my car. However, I would not choose to use the BMW Durham centre if I was to buy a new car again, nor would I recommend. My partner and I visited knowing which car we wanted to purchase. We had two used cars to part exchange and a budget of under £400 a month. The sales executive approached us as we were looking at the car in showroom. We agreed to look at figures etc. Although she was friendly and approachable I found her slightly too familiar and we were not offered a test drive before signing. I requested a test drive and unfortunately the only car available was the one in the show room. We were told we could sign the sale agreement and leave deposit and come back later in the week to take one home to drive, which was inconvenient with work commitments. However I was reluctant to sign for a £39k car without having driven it. I suggested to go to Sunderland and maybe they would have one in but management then agreed to let us test drive the show room vehicle. On return from the drive we were happy to sign the relevant documents and hand over the partial deposit of £500. This is when the experience went downhill. On leaving we asked for a brochure of the car and were told it would be emailed. I am still waiting now for the email. I wasn't sent any form of confirmation either. A couple of days later I took my son to BMW Sunderland to show him the model of car and whilst there I was approached by Dean Lamb a sales exec. I explained I had already purchased a car from yourselves but mentioned about a brochure. He advised they had none available and explained I should have been sent one and received some sort of confirmation. He took me over to his desk and sent me it in an email there and then. He was astounded that I had received no confirmation of the sale. I have dealt with BMW Sunderland in the past when purchasing a used vehicle and found their level of customer service blew Durham out of the water in relation to professionalism and care. On this occasion we visited Durham as we live closer and were visiting the nearby ford garage. I tried to contact Sara on multiple occasions with no avail around my private plates being assigned to the vehicle and a date for collection. I called to the centre with my plates and asked Sara if they could be assigned and put on the vehicle when it arrived but was told this was not possible, which was fine. When the date came I was left a voicemail on my mobile. Myself and my partner then met at the centre with our young son. Ryan came over and introduced himself and explained he would show us around the car. I was surprised to see it was outside in the cold wet weather with the private reg stuck on but not the plates I had left. Ryan explained thoroughly in detail everything to do with the car interior and exterior. He was pleasant and knowledgeable. He answered our questions to the best of his ability. He then took us back inside to wait for Sara and offered us drinks. The handover was poor in terms of it being outside in dark, wet weather and Sara had no enthusiasm at all , no hand shake gesture was offered. On completing the handover she was very lax and forgot to get us to sign a couple of documents. Luckily we were held up when leaving as another member of staff had parked her car in the way of our exit blocking us and other colleagues in. Sara then came out with a handover document to sign. A week later another missed document came to light with regards to the settlement on a part ex, meaning the finance still came out of my bank when it shouldn't have done. An issue I will now have to rectify. I felt like once I had signed the initial papers Sara had very little interest- hence no brochure sent. I did not feel as though they had just sold me a brand new car and would not expect this from such a superior brand company. I have had better customer service from Nissan in the past. In future I will use the Sunderland BMW centre for all services/mot and future cars. It could be lack of training and therefore not the sales execs fault however it was severely inadequate for what I expected. It left me with a really bitter taste in my mouth. I would appreciate it if management could contact me via email to discuss this."
2019-03-16,3,Service was quick and fast however they said they would clean my car and it’s not be cleaned at all as far as I can see. Doesn’t look touched! Quite dissapointed to see this.
2019-03-16,5,"Good front of house service, I was kept informed at all stages of what was happening with the car.

Thank you VW."
2019-03-16,1,"Shocking customer service - felt like I was palmed off around the entire switchboard for 30minutes. Staff seemed to have no idea which department to transfer my call too or just not bothered to help. Plus no apologies for the long wait and just no care.

My enquiry was eventually taken note of and I was told I would be contacted on the matter. I have had no communication since. Problem unresolved.

Won’t be taking vehicle back for anything in future. They rip you off with added things all the time. & your manipulated in taking your vehicle back for a service.

Still getting over how on one occasion my car had to run through the tech diagnostics twice as the system couldn’t trace a fault the first time. & therefore being charged twice for their technology. Ridiculous.

Sort it out BMW Chelmsford - a right CON."
2019-03-16,1,"Terrible customer service from Cooper Teeside. They have had my car for 4 weeks to complete a service and safety recall. The dealer has provided me with no updates regarding progress, every time i call you get either no answer or i am rudely cut off. The only way to get information from these people, is to physically turn up at the garage. Eventually i did get a call from them three and a half weeks after having the car telling me the part for the recall had arrived and had been fitted. Strangely i was also informed that they had still to complete the service even though they had had the car for a number of weeks. That was a week ago still no further contact from the dealer. I rang this morning, put on hold for 10 minutes and told that someone would ring me back, I am still waiting!!! Steer clear of this dealership, i will not be buying BMW again!!!"
2019-03-16,5,"Fantastic service. Staff very helpful throughout the whole process, and the final result is excellent. Car picked up on schedule and it's a pleasure to drive."
2019-03-16,5,"great experience, car was as promised on time,clean and fueled. sales staff excellent and done a great deal for me."
2019-03-15,4,"The service was friendly and efficient. I booked a waiting appointment and was kept informed of progress. I also has a recent problem repaired under warranty that was in addition to what I booked in for. The reason I did not give 5 starts was due to waiting room facilities. There was a hot drinks machine but no snacks. The wifi wasn't working, which was perhaps out of their hands but also there were no plugs for my laptop in the waiting area. Having said that I asked to use one and was taken to a side office. Overall I would be happy to use this garage again."
2019-03-15,5,"First class customer experience with great showroom facilities and friendly, knowledgeable staff."
2019-03-15,5,"Really couldnt fault the team at Southport Mercedes. They worked very hard to find me the car and finance which fit. If youre looking for a Mercedes, or just comparing brands, Id recommend stopping in to speak to them."
2019-03-15,5,"As always, great service from the team."
2019-03-15,4,Billy was very helpful and ran me through it stage of the service process..great customer service
2019-03-15,5,"Perfect as always, thank you."
2019-03-15,5,Fantastic experience! Mini/BMW Malton couldn’t do enough for us.
2019-03-15,4,Competent and professional
2019-03-15,5,"First Service:
Service was finished in less than time quoted.
Very positive attitude of service advisor who kept me informed of progress."
2019-03-15,5,Picked up the car Phoned to confirm service requirements and phoned again to get approval for work to be carried out. Returned car valeted same day. Excellent service and cannot ask for more.
2019-03-15,5,Very impressed with the overall service. A video was sent to me giving the 'health check' of the car. From this the garage advise anything that needs attention and send costs directly to you. This then allows you to request the work or ignore. I consider this a much better option than the dreaded phone call. Would definitely recommend.
2019-03-15,5,"Booked a car Service with Cooper BMW Durham. All staff I met were really professional, nothing was too much trouble.

The estimated time to collect the car was 5 hours however I was called within 3 which was wonderful and also offered complimentary wash and vacuum.

Couldn’t ask for more, I always buy my cars from Cooper based on the this excellent service delivered time and time again.."
2019-03-14,5,Excellent service and enthusiastic staff
2019-03-14,1,"Service rep spoke like I owed her something, overheard another staff member (sue) speak to another customer like crap. Considering it's a reputable main dealer customer service is horrible, waited a long time for my service book to be stamped while staff were walking around like the sun shines out of their backside.
I could say so much but even thinking about my experience there depresses me.
I shan't be returning to Inchcape. Spend money on customer service."
2019-03-14,3,Drop off was stressful due to confusion over parking. Pick up wait was unduly long. But reception staff on desk were very polite and helpful.
2019-03-14,5,"Excellent customer service. They found the perfect the car for me.
Well done Patrick and Julie...
I highly recommend Coopers of Tonbridge if one is looking for a BMW !!!"
2019-03-14,5,Has to haggle with then on price but overall really great
2019-03-14,5,Courteous and efficient service. This was a good purchasing experience and I would use them again in the future.
2019-03-14,5,"Picked up my new car from Cooper BMW York yesterday. The complete process from ordering to picking my new car was so easy, with a very professional and knowledgeable team, updating me throughout the process. A special thank you to Tom for making the process so easy."
2019-03-14,3,"1. Requested a call-back re-purchase contract detail on Inchcape gap-cover told someone would phone me back. Next day pm still no call-back so I had to call the dealership again to get my Gap-cover confirmation.
2.Same day phoned dealership about Alloy wheel insurance cover, told person was busy but someone would phone me back; 24 hours later still no call back.

Expected better for my first Mercedes

I want to insure my new car, don't inchcape want to sell me insurance?"
2019-03-14,1,"I bought a 18 month old Mercedes 6 months ago from Inchcape Mercedes in Nottingham and took out a cosmetic repair insurance which now is a useful as a chocolate teapot, i had a couple of stone chips and a scratch which was within the size and depth for the car to be fixed but because it is on the bonnet they will not repair it, so £1000 completely wasted, do not let yourself be missold one of these insurances like i have been!! wish i never stepped foot inside the dealer now!
the people at Inchcape are useless and very rude too."
2019-03-14,4,Good service from the technician but disappointed that the car is not valeted anymore before being returned
2019-03-14,2,"I took my car in for 09.30, I was about 10 minutes early. Provided with a lease car and was told it would be an hour and a half maximum. I told the service receptionist I would return later in the day for it and presumed by going back at 2.15 it would be ready. No, it hadn't been touched and was parked outside where I had left it at 09.20, I would have imagined 5 hours enough time and I was then kept waiting until 3.15 for it. The whole experience was poor and stressful and we spoke to two other customers who were in the same predicament as us.
I was also disappointed to find the lease car dirty inside and outside, none of what we experienced should be the standard accepted by Mini/ Cooper BMW.
We were given an apology but when we change this car very soon are not sure it will be here after the poor experience yesterday."
2019-03-14,5,Service carried out in a timely manner and returned washed and buffed!
2019-03-14,5,"Fantastic service from the person on the phone, to make the apt, and also the lady who meets and greets and the 2 gentleman that dealt with the car problem. It was a recall situation re the rear glass, dealt with very quickly and even glued my Toyota badge back on the boot which had fallen off 2 days . It is not often nowadays you receive good service and I was very impressed and mentioned this to other people I work with so well done."
2019-03-14,5,We were very impressed with the service from Cooper Reading and especially Andy Hawes. Love the (as good as) new BMW!
2019-03-14,5,Fantastic team at Mercedes-Benz Southport. Many thanks to David Rubin for the ease in buying a new car and also thanks to Mark for his help as well. Definitely worth a visit for your next car.
2019-03-14,5,Excellent help & advice from Paul Care.
2019-03-14,1,I took my Mercedes to the Warrington Branch after receiving a recall notice. Having booked a drop off time in advance I dropped my car off at 8.45am and was told that it would take roughly an hour to complete the relevant recall notice work. I informed the staff member that rather than wait I would return to work and pick the car up during my lunch break between 12 and 1. I returned to pick the car up at 12.45 and was told someone would be out shortly to give me my keys back. I waited for 30 minutes and heard nothing. I asked the reception to check where my keys were as I was already late returning to work. I then noticed my car drive past the front windows towards the service area. Clearly they hadn't even started the work. At 2pm I was then told it would be 15 minutes. I eventually received my keys back at 2.30pm. Before I share my opinion on this I have to say this is not the first time that Mercedes Warrington have kept me waiting. Last time I had to take my car in for a recall notice I was waiting for 3 hours when I was told it was less than an hours job. Hence why I decide to wait rather than return to work. I fully understand that these sort of things are hard to give an exact time to complete the work. My frustration is the lack of communication. Its basic customer service. In this instance if I was called to say that my car hadn't been done I could have stayed at work and picked the car up on my way home. Instead I heard nothing contrary to what I was told by the member of staff so simply turned up as agreed to pick my car up. To then have to wait for nearly 2 hours because they hadn't bothered to do the work on my car is just unacceptable. Like I said I understand that there may be influences outside of Mercedes control that may delay work to be completed. But what they can control is the level of communication so that I do not waste my time. I provided feedback on poor communication a year ago and evidently they have done nothing about it.
2019-03-14,5,"5 stars: Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone."
2019-03-14,2,"I booked my Landrover in to the Slyfield garage as the passenger door wasn't locking properly. They fixed that fine, but when I got home I discovered the drivers door wasn't locking either. Turns out both were broken initially and I had only noticed the passenger one so that's the only one they checked. They obviously didn't try and lock the car afterwards as if they would they would have noticed the double beep.
Very disappointing....."
2019-03-14,5,Excellent and friendly service that was carried out much quicker than I expected.
2019-03-13,5,"Yolanta explained everything really well, she explained how long it would take and that a video will be sent so I could see everything for myself. Jake sent a video, really easy to understand and well explained. Yolanta came back to me with my paperwork and explained each part of the service checks, my car even took less time than expected. A fantastic service and experience at Mercedes-Benz Nottingham"
2019-03-13,4,"Perfect customer service. Professional, attentive and thoroughly nice and genuine team"
2019-03-13,1,"Be warned everyone. I dropped my BMW car in for a simple diagnostic check at Cooper BMW Norwich, when I dropped my car off I was informed they were very busy at the moment but they would be able to run the required diagnostic check within 2 to 3 days but 10 days later and despite calls trying to expedite the work and requests for an eta and explaining I need the car for work, Coopers have still have not done the test and the nearest other bmw dealer is 30 to 40 miles away. The lack of customer service and contempt is truly horrifying and does not bode well."
2019-03-13,4,"Received good customer care, job was done while waiting and it din't take long,"
2019-03-13,5,I was very please how smooth everything went they came and picked the car up and dropped it off
2019-03-13,5,"I have just purchased a new vehicle from Inchcape Mercedes-Benz of Derby and found the entire process a delight. The showroom was immaculately presented and all the staff professional and courteous. The sales team offered an excellent deal on both my new and trade in vehicles from the outset unlike my previous experiences at other dealerships where a continual battle would be necessary over days or weeks to get a reasonable deal. The sales consultant - Mark Rose was most knowledgeable and a pleasure to deal with throughout, answering any questions, giving a detailed explanation of my new vehicle's controls on the day of collection and phoning me the next day to ensure all was well. This was my first ever Mercedes purchase so whether this level of service is true of any Mercedes dealership I couldn't say but either way I would have no reservations in recommending Inchcape Mercedes-Benz of Derby to anyone looking to purchase a Mercedes in the future."
2019-03-13,5,"I have had end of warranty check done at Teeside Cooper BMW. Overall good experience. Sophie, the girl who was looking after me, was nice and helpful. I used driver to get to work and back. Again decent guy with good manners, and courteous. I would recommend the Cooper's service."
2019-03-13,1,"Lied to and treated with disrespect then lied to again and again, promised repairs not done 3 times , time completely wasted and pulled out of used car sale , disgusting deceitful sales reps that promise anything to get you to sign ."
2019-03-13,4,It took a while to retrieve my car when i came in to pick it up but staff were friendly and knowledgeable and the service very good
2019-03-13,5,"Mot and service- car dropped off and courtesy car ride both ways- all very efficient, friendly staff and seamless process"
2019-03-13,5,Having purchased a used Mercedes from inchcape I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone. Easy and pleasant experience
2019-03-13,5,Excellent service very friendly/ helpful staff. Just an excellent experience.
2019-03-13,5,"I recently bought a car from this dealership and couldn't recommend them highly enough, in particular Josh Zarembski who I dealt with was extremely professional throughout, informative and knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone looking to buy a BMW and will pass his details on to all my family and friends!!"
2019-03-13,5,Sorted a car out in a day and received a week later.
2019-03-13,5,Easy to deal with
2019-03-13,3,"Got asked to do a 'review' questionnaire on IPad BUT because they didnt like the star rating i gave, i got begged to change it! Im my opinion NOBODY gets 5* as that is perfection, the VW garage i go to is far from perfect! After explaining my rating & getting nowhere, I gave the 'questionnaire' back to the assistant to fill in himself if he wanted certain answers and got told he couldnt do it, i had to - NO point what so ever as all they want is 5* ratings!! Car still NOT vac'd at the back as usual with EVERY car ive had from them due to dog hairs! Im always told its done BUT i may be female but far from thick and know perfectly well when it has been vac'd and when it hasnt as i do it myself!! Then to be told the service price was reduced from the £250 quoted to £179 because 'its ONLY an UP'! Yes, it might be ONLY an UP but its brand new driven by me out of the showroom along with my husband who also had a new showroom Passat AND along with ALL the cars we have had brand new from that garage - so ONLY an UP was an absolute insult! After years of loyal custom, neither myself nor my husband have any desire to go back to purchase any more vehicles from this garage due to your customer service, or should i say lack of!"
2019-03-13,5,"Very good service; sales staff very attentive, knowledgeable and professional. Very comfortable environment showroom). All-in-all a very helpful and professional service. Would recommend highly."
2019-03-13,5,"We had a fantastic experience with VW in West London. Nitesh was excellent, made us feel comfortable, answered all our queries and gave us excellent customer service. Very friendly and approachable guy. Thank you."
2019-03-12,5,Fast efficient service. Everything explained in detail and dealing with staff was easy.
2019-03-12,5,I give 5 star.
2019-03-12,5,"I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Coopers Teesside. The service I received when buying a used car was superb.

First contact was with a very patient Martin Jones who listened to my list of questions and gave honest answers.

When I arrived to view the car Martin was waiting to greet me and I was allowed as much time as I felt necessary to inspect the car, I was also encouraged to highlight any areas of concern. The well planned test route I was taken on incorporated different quality road surfaces to ensure that my concerns regarding ride quality were answered.

After a relaxed talk about all the options BMW offer and the benefits connected with buying from BMW. I decided to go ahead with buying the car but I must stress at no point did I feel under any pressure to buy.

On the day I collected the car everything was ready when I arrived. The car was fully valeted, paperwork ready for checking and signing etc.

So, not only have I ended up buying a fantastic car but the whole buying experience was far better than I expected. Also, I’d like to pass on my thanks to Martin Jones, who I dealt with, who was extremely helpful, efficient and professional."
2019-03-12,5,"Really very friendly and efficient. The salesman I dealt with, John, was more than helpful. This is my third car from this dealership, and I have been a client of theirs since 2008. I see no reason to change. If you try them, you will see my point. I'm quite demanding because I lead a busy life and I need services to fit around that. They haven't let me down yet."
2019-03-12,1,Arrived at 8:20 for an 8:30 appointment to fit mud flaps front and back while I wait.Three and a half hours later still not finished. Apparently all tech staff called into a meeting. So much the customer. My first experience of Inchcape Derby not a good start.
2019-03-12,5,"From start Rachel was very helpful professional and courteous throughout the process of buying the car. I have no hesitation in recommending Inchape
Jaguar dealer at York."
2019-03-12,5,"Fantastic sales experience from beginning to end, car ready on time as promised, nothing too much trouble for Nick!"
2019-03-12,5,"I purchased a Golf auto. from Inchcape Colchester back in 2010 and received excellent service both from the sales and service department's, However I suffered a health problem that left me unable to walk without a stick and found it difficult to bend down making it hard to get into my wonderful little golf, so I then purchased a Mercedes B class and that for 3 years but really missed my Golf. so almost two years ago now I purchased a VW Tiguan again from Inchcape Colchester and again received excellent service, now after the two years of having this brilliant car I took it back to Inchcape Colchester for it's first service allow I could have taken it to a much closer VW agent I am happy to make the 1 hour each way journey, because I know I would be putting both my car and myself in the best possible hands.
I was particularly impressed by the young lady ""Lucy"" who dealt with everything as she was so very helpful and patient with me, accepting my problem with walking, So a special thanks to her,"
2019-03-12,5,"Great job, my car was reapired, washed and ready to go ahead of schedule."
2019-03-12,3,"Booking the service was just painful with no appointments for a month!
Then there was no reminder about the appointment - I feel this is as simple as sending an automated email in this day and age!
Finally, I was promised pick up of my car between 830am and 1130am. My car was picked up at nearly 1pm. And there was no communication from Mini - I had to phone up and ask where the driver was!
My car is an HP car so I don't consider it to be mine, I'm just borrowing it from Mini. I feel that it is up to Mini to make sure they look after their car. As Mini are able to read my mileage at any given time why can they not simply book in a service and let me know its been done?
Anyhow - this experience has left me not wanting to replace my car with another Mini when the time comes. And that is after being with Mini for over 12 years."
2019-03-12,5,"The car service experience worked seamlessly, with everyonel at Cooper BMW providing a friendly, polite and efficient service."
2019-03-12,3,"Paking was a nightmare on the way in.
No courtesy car.

I was told I would get a call at 2pm that day letting me know when I could get my car.

After not getting any call, I called at 4:30pm and I was told they were too busy and someone would call me. That call never came.

When I then called the following day, I was told that someone left a message for me to come and get my car.

For the money spent on a routine service, the customer ‘experience’ leaves a lot to be desired.
Middle management should be spending time on how the customer is looked after in between the delivery of the car and collection.
This is not a jibe but a constructive set of information that any company selling a luxury product should act upon if they value their customers"
2019-03-12,5,"Easy to book my service, efficient customer service and feedback about my vehicle."
2019-03-12,5,"When I took my mini in for a service at Mini Chelmsford, Olivia was extremely helpful and explained everything I needed to know then answered all my questions. I was given a courtesy car and as it was a automatic and I usually drive a manual they very kindly went over how to drive which I was very grateful for - when collecting my car again super friendly and helpful. Thank you :-)"
2019-03-12,5,"Our experience was beyond expectation, the staff @ Mini Cooper were amazing, professional, helpful & very knowledgable.
We could not recommend enough."
2019-03-12,5,"I regard my trips to Inchcape Toyota as more of a social occasion, than a routine necessity. The staff are friendly, helpful and give exceptional service. My car was ready on time and was returned in a nice clean condition. I would certainly recommend this company to anyone."
2019-03-12,4,"My car was booked in for a service, which was carried out with the professionalism that I would expect. The garage environment is very comfortable, with refreshments on hand.
My only adverse comment is the time it took to pay and collect my car. I waited for around 20 minutes from the agreed collection time before someone came with my bill.
Apart from that, I would book my car in again for a service"
2019-03-12,2,"I arrived 10 minutes early for a 90 minute fast lane service. Was finally greeted 15 mins later and keys taken 10 minutes after that. After 2 hrs still not heard how things were going. Was told they would check in 10 mins or so. Finally received car back after 3 hrs. Double their promised time frame. Simple issue I'd requested still not properly looked at and no apology for delay just a shrugging acceptance that they're just busy. Same excuse as the last time we used them.
Nowhere to park as they're overstocked, dismissive staff and appalling delays.
Note to Mini- I love my mini. I absolutely do not love your service and customer ""non-assistance""."
2019-03-12,4,"My sales exec (lily c) was warm and friendly. She was very good at getting through the mundane aspects however, let herself down with scheduling the car pick up. That's the only reason it isn't a 5 star."
2019-03-12,5,An excellent service curtsey of Martin Jones. Regular updates about the handover and an overall enjoyable experience.
2019-03-12,5,Mini service
2019-03-11,5,"Amazing service, far exceeded my expectations around having my car serviced, nothing was too much trouble."
2019-03-11,5,Marc Dexter was fantastic throughout the whole process. Would definitely recommend
2019-03-11,5,"I have dealt with Inchcape Mercedes Leicester for a number of years, always a great service!! The staff are very friendly and welcoming and the servicing of the vehicles has always been first class."
2019-03-11,5,Fantastic customer service and high quality mechanical work mean my experiences with Inchcape Colchester are consistently positive. Inchcape Colchester colleagues are friendly and accommodating with a great level of knowledge. The facilities are also excellent.
2019-03-11,4,"Great service and customer care, I would have given 5 stars had they just spelt my name right."
2019-03-11,5,Most helpfull with a good knowledge of the product they sell.
2019-03-11,5,"Very helpful sales, kept me informed all the way. 10 out of 10. I wasnt going to buy a BMW due to the poor service I used to get from the servicing team they were terrible. Let's hope I get a better experience when my car is due for a service. Joel was an excellent sales man. Well done great guy. Give him a raise"
2019-03-11,5,"It’s great, I have had this on all 3 minis that I’ve had."
2019-03-11,5,Excellent Service
2019-03-11,5,Excellent service in all respects
2019-03-11,5,"An absolutely great service. Professional, prompt and thorough service. I bought a discovery sport and it was a very enjoyable experience. Will definitely upgrade with Inchcape next time."
2019-03-11,5,"We saw an E pace on line, email to test drive and within 2 mins had a response from Louie. He then emailed us back with a video of the car within half an hour. ( this was tailor made to us, such a nice touch)when we arrived to test drive the E pace, it was ready and waiting in their holding area. The deal was done very efficiently and we found the customer service absolutely fantastic. ( after being disappointed at another jaguar dealership in our area) . We have no hesitation in using Inchcape in the future, well done Louie!"
2019-03-11,5,A relaxed friendly service. Kept up to date with the whole transaction thank you Simon
2019-03-11,5,Very professional service taking time and trouble to ensure the right purchase was made. Top marks to Richard Turner who really gave the personal touches well.
2019-03-11,2,"This is the third time my vehicle has been into Coopers at Chelmsford in the last few months. Every time i get a little more annoyed with the service. Every time I get my vehicle back I have to take it to have a valet, due to the mess its left in. I picked my vehicle up today and it was so dirty i was shocked they would had it back to me in such a state, it was not like it when they picked it up. I think the large paint chip on the wing was the reason for the non wash. They would have had more than enough time to wash it considering I was left sitting in the waiting area for over 40 minutes. Poor poor service, wont be buying a new BMW anytime soon (or ever again)"
2019-03-11,5,"The team were very efficient and welcoming., good job!"
2019-03-11,5,"Very efficient and friendly service. No pressure at any time, very happy with the vehicle."
2019-03-11,5,"Excellent service friendly staff.
Couldn't do enough for you, even after sales."
2019-03-11,5,"What an awesome dealership. I had a few hiccups early on in my order, but the service that I received from MB Liverpool was ace. In particular, Martin - my sales executive and Darren the GM/Sales Director were brilliant. Very supportive, kept me informed through the order process and were available to deal with my new car order very smoothly indeed. Have already recommended them to colleagues."
2019-03-11,5,Bought the car completely remotely. excellent service very please got an excellent discount
2019-03-11,3,"Service was done on time and they even sent a helpful video by email to highlight a couple of areas of concern. Also, it was very efficient in terms of taking payment on the day of the service.

However, I had arranged to pick up the car from the dealership the following day at 11am. Upon turning up, they didn't seem to know where the car was, upon locating it, it became clear that it was parked as part of a large parking lot with cars behind it and in front of it."
2019-03-11,5,Very helpful and accomodating
2019-03-11,5,The team always treat me really well and communicate any issues with me car whilst its in. Will always recommend this Audi centre. The car always comes back nice and clean so cant fault them!
2019-03-11,5,"Prompt, accurate and a clean place to drop off and pick up your car. Quality work done as promised."
2019-03-11,5,"Absolutely fab!!! Lauren and seany are the best, they sorted me and my boyfriend out with excellent deals on our A-class’s!! Thank you for all your hard work!!!"
2019-03-11,5,"We have recently purchased our car from Inchcape Land Lover Preston and I must say that we were very pleased with their services and their attention to detail.
Our sales person was Alan Wood and we could not praise him enough for going the extra mile to ensure that we were happy with our purchase and that the car was in exceptional shape when we collected it. He was extremely professional and polite at all times and we did not feel rushed nor pressured in making a decision. He was just happy to show us the car, how it drives, etc. He took his time to talk us through all the process and to show us how to improve the driving experience on our vehicle.
He even called the following day to ensure that we made it home safely and that we were pleased with everything.
All we can wish is for them to keep up the great work."
2019-03-11,3,"Unfortunately when I arrived for my timed appointment I was advised things were running behind schedule and then this was compounded by what should have been a 90 minute service taking a bit over 2 hours.
What added to the annoyance of the delays was the absolutely lousy Wi-Fi, less than 1mb download speed. I had my iPad with me which is Wi-Fi only and wasn't able to watch anything on it due to the slow Wi-Fi speeds"
2019-03-10,1,"Terrible service here. I was told car was fixed and all tested. Drove out and 10 minutes later the car broke down, Engine failure. Called centre and they said they would call straight back after speaking with engineer. No call back. I called back and then centre was now closed for the weekend. Awful"
2019-03-10,5,"My experience at Audi Stockport was fantastic. Dee was efficient and extremely knowledgeable on ensuring I purchase the perfect vehicle for myself. He was very patient and kept me updated through the entire process of looking for a vehicle and picking the vehicle up. He answered all of my questions with great knowledge,and I could not have wished for any better service that I received. Dee made buying my first vehicle feel extremely simple ensuring I had the best customer experience possible. My conversations with Geoff also allowed me to feel like a valued customer and I believe every single one of my needs were met due to the fantastic customer service and knowledge provided by Dee and Geoff. I will be recommending my contacts to purchase from Stockport Audi, I cannot thank the staff enough."
2019-03-10,5,"I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase a BMW. The service here is absolutely fantastic. It was my first new car purchase so Jonathan Hood and his management team ensured I had nothing less than a brilliant experience. From finding my car, to presenting me with options that enabled me to make the most informed decision, to collecting my car with a lovely surprise (bouquet of beautiful flowers). The end to end experience here is brilliant. Attentive and welcoming staff and a real sense of ""customer comes first"" here. Thank you all for making my first new car purchase a wonderful experience."
2019-03-10,2,"My car was booked in for an interim service for £220 with a suggested time of 2 - 3 hours quoted, it took 6.
I was told I needed a brake fluid change and air con service only when checking my car in, another £190 - why wasn't i told at the time of booking?
Just as i was eventually leaving I was told to bring the car back in two weeks for rear brake pads, cost £270, why wasn't this done with the service?
My £220 interim service will cost more like £700 and two days lost, thank goodness it wasn't a full service."
2019-03-10,3,"My car was in the garage for its first service and I was told it would be ready by 5.00pm but I would receive a phone call before that. I telephoned at 4.45 to see if it would be ready by 5pm and was told someone would get back to me, 3 days later and I still haven’t received said call. I went through to the garage at 5.30 and after waiting my car was eventually ready, however it had not been valeted and I was asked to make another appointment to have this done.
Overall, for the cost of the service I was extremely disappointed in the customer care I received."
2019-03-10,5,"Very efficient, polite and professional service.

The service was done as it should have been with a courtesy car provided as well, along with a car wash on my vehicle.

The service agent went through the health check thoroughly to explain everything within the check to me accordingly."
2019-03-10,5,"Been with BMW-Inchcape - Ipswich since 2013. Initial good sales and then I experienced a significant dip in their customer service but in the last two years, I feel there is a conscious attempt to improve customer service. Recent experience this month was very friendly, methodical and professional but could also be due to the efficiency of one personnel in particular - Megan Flatt - who I thought was brilliant in arranging everything. Still waiting to hear for my EGF goodwill refund though but I am optimistic this will not be delayed. - Dr S Sharma"
2019-03-09,5,"Lee Chapman worked really hard to get me sorted with my new mini ASAP
Cannot thank him enough, he managed to get everything sorted and turned around within 2 weeks
Thanks Lee"
2019-03-09,1,"Coppers BMW Colchester advertise cars which they do not hold, entice you in they attempt to sell you cars you don't want. They are untrustworthy, have zero integrity, interested only in making a sale."
2019-03-09,5,"Dear Sir,
It was great to visit you to have a car health check ,excellent service provided and the staff concerned were very helpful .I am very pleased the way I was dealt with.Staff were very polite and helpful.I will recommend Croydon BMW to any one who wishes to meet good team worker to help you open heartedly."
2019-03-09,5,Second car I have bought from this dealership and the service has again been first class.
2019-03-09,5,excellent service
2019-03-09,5,The whole purchase experience was painless and simple. Simon Morley was brilliant and guided me through the whole process online with no glitches. I'd definitely recommend Simon and the dealership if you're looking for a new car.
2019-03-09,5,"This was my first purchase of a new Jaguar from Inchcape Norwich and I was very impressed with their staff throughout. I ordered the I-Pace in May 2018 and was given exceptional help during the build process. I had to wait 8 months until January 2019 before the car was available, but the delay was outside Inchcape's control and they kept me informed of the situation on a regular basis. I was given a thorough training session when I took delivery of the car. Overall a first class experience."
2019-03-09,4,Good service
2019-03-09,5,Great customer service and experience. Felt welcomed from the moment we walked through the door A special thanks to Sophie for all her help.

2019-03-09,5,"Had a great experience from negotiation to final pick up of car. We were kept informed every step if the way. This is the second car I have purchased from this franchise, both times I found the price very competitive and enjoyed dealing with the people there. Thanks to Imy for all his help through the process. We have had our new mini for a week, it looks and drives brilliantly, couldn't be happier."
2019-03-09,1,"Cooper BMW Chelmsford - rang them countless times over the last week, either no answer, put on hold for ages having to listen to messages telling me how fantastic they are, or on the occasions I did actually manage speak to someone I was repeatedly promised someone would call me back. No one ever did. I have given up. Avoid. There are plenty of far better BMW dealerships to use"
2019-03-08,4,Very happy with the work and customer service. The free collection and return of the vehicle was extremely hassle free. The reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that the courtesy clean of the vehicle interior and exterior on this occasion was done to a dissapointingly low standard.
2019-03-08,5,"The whole process from start to finish was the best car showroom experience I have ever had. Wayne Haddon and Inchcape Southampton have made my buying experience second to none.

If I could I would award 10 stars.

Thank you

Bob"
2019-03-08,1,I had to wait 40 minutes just to pick up my car and when I got my car back it was still dirty...I said why was I waiting 40 mins for the vehicle and it has not been cleaned the staff member replied because we couldn't find your car.. It was terrible service..
2019-03-08,5,Recently purchased T-Roc from Inchcape Stretford .My sales executive Syed Shah made the process of buying a new car pain free . He was able to secure me a great deal and the transaction was processed quickly and efficiently.

2019-03-07,5,"Bought our range rover sport from John Hill at inchape Preston, I can honestly say it was a pleasurable experience despite having to part with hard earned money x John was very informative on the car we bought , nothing was to much trouble , 2 test drives and no pressure . I would not hesitate in recommending the staff at inchape Preston, If you want honesty, and quality , then this is the company to deal with . I would certainly give them my business in the future .

2019-03-07,5,"I bought a Merc GLE from Mercedes Cheshire. From begining to end it was a fantastic experience. The salesperson was Hannah Weatherspoon. She handled the sale with professionalism and patience when dealing with me. Nothing was too much trouble. She even called the day after to make sure I didn’t have any problems. Every member of staff who I dealt with gave me the same level of service, from the Boss to the person who made me a coffee. I will be buying my next car from Inchcape UK. Many thanks"
2019-03-07,5,"Very good service from Neil Hastings and a very nice man , he showed me everything I will go there again"
2019-03-07,5,Excellent customer service.
2019-03-07,5,Straightforward supportive process. Young sales executive who was knowledgeable and helpful. At no point did I feel pressured.
2019-03-07,5,Very helpful from start to finish. They found me a car that was within my budget and were very professional and friendly. Very pleased with the whole process.
2019-03-07,5,"My dealings with this company have been excellent. Friendly faces and professional attitudes were the first impressions i encountered as I walked into the establishment.
No messing, no red tape, just straight forward practice. Everything was explained understandably and I was contacted as soon as the car was ready."
2019-03-07,5,"Honest, helpful and friendly service from Ollie. Made it easy for me to make a decision."
2019-03-07,5,Really pleased with BMW Cooper Norwich
2019-03-07,5,"Perfect from initial enquiry to handover of my fantastic Jaguar XK. Louis the sales executive was friendly and professional from start to finish.
I really can’t fault buying a vehicle from Inchcape Preston. Well done guys. Steve"
2019-03-07,5,"Took my vehicle here because my local BMW garage could not fit it in for an mot until 1 month after my current one ran out.
Coopers were efficient, staff polite and friendly. They sorted the mot and a recall/ warranty problem. I probably won't be using my local one again as this is the second time (the first was after a breakdown to do with the warranty issue) that they have almost refused to help me. Coopers have just gained themselves another customer."
2019-03-07,5,"I have bought a new Mercedes car for the first time. My experience with the Warrington Showroom was flawless from start to finish. The customer service from everyone working there is truly exceptional.
I would like to highlight Tony, who sold the car to us. He was helpful, patient and professional at all times. I would not hesitate to recommend him and the showroom staff to all."
2019-03-07,5,"BMW Coopers, Norwich. Vehicle in for recall work. Friendly service work completed on time, vehicle given health check & wash. entirely happy."
2019-03-07,2,"Pretty poor really. Waited 4 weeks for a service with a loan car, called the day before saying there wasn’t a car for me, then told I had to wait another 4 weeks, so had to ask to speak to a manager to get my car in sooner!

Didn’t even wash my car after saying they would as well."
2019-03-07,5,"I got exactly what I wanted and expect from and MB dealer - courteous, efficient, smooth and together."
2019-03-07,3,"Disappointed with my visit to Inchcape, I’m not a local to the area so it’s the first time I used this service center.

Car was booked in for front brake pads to be replaced, upon inspection I received a call informing me that all pads needed replacing and the front discs needed replacing too (typical....) I was quoted a price of £900, according to the jaguar website the servicing costs for front pads and discs is only £452.44, rear pads £184.94, after pointing this out the price dropped to £615. Left me feeling very untrusting of inchape, the final insult was a small one but tarnished my view enough that, when finally being handed the keys back, my outreached hand was ignored and the keys thrown on the table next to me. While I understand many will view this as petty, it was enough for me not to consider using inchape again."
2019-03-07,5,"I have just bought a used E Class from this dealership and I must say the service was really good from the off. The reception staff were always really attentive and excellent. I dealt with Ben and his service was also excellent as was the sales manager whose name escapes me, but his laid back attitude was really good and made you at ease. Would go back again without a thought."
2019-03-07,5,Absolutely wonderful service and reception from moment walked in door to view until our eventual purpose
2019-03-07,5,"This is my first time with Toyota. All the staff attending my requirements were polite, courteous ,and extremely helpful.
I would have no hesitation in recommending Inchcape Toyota Sandhurst to anyone."
2019-03-07,5,Jordan at the Guildford Inchcape was very friendy yet professional and kept me up to date with what was going on. Excellent customer service 😊
2019-03-07,5,"Great customer experience as always. Car in for its routine service and Gary kept to the promised time of 2 hours and made sure I was updated on how it was going. Also a full explanation was given of everything that had been done once the service was completed. Brenda did a great job of ensuring, that whilst I waited, plenty of coffee and refreshments were provided."
2019-03-07,5,I received excellent service on time and the staff were very polite and helpful. This was my first visit to the garage/showroom in Pride Park and I was very impressed with the receptionist and service/attention by Mr Tolan.
2019-03-07,4,"Leicester Mercedes Benz where excellent and very welcoming and helpful, but let down by the service centre in Nottingham, I asked for the car to be collected as my partner is disabled and needs someone with her, I've always used this service but when booking the car in for its service way back in January I was told I couldn't have the car collected, I could sit and wait or drop off and collect later, I had to get a helper in to sit with my partner while I brought the car over, in all about 3 hours with the traveling.
this needs to be sorted and your booking staff trained on the services offed by Mercedes Benz"
2019-03-06,5,Excellent service - huge thanks to Edward Harrison for all his help! Appreciated the honesty and genuine service received and super happy with the car!
2019-03-06,5,Recently bought a beautiful ex-demo Jaguar XJ from Inchcape in Preston. Well served and looked after by Alan Wood. Car was very well presented and it was a pleasure doing business with Alan and the company.
2019-03-06,5,"After spotting a mini countryman in a car park, myself and my daughter walked in to cooper Durham, we were greeted with an offer of tea, coffee and biscuits, absolutely no pressure sales, without blabbering on I have had a great buying experience, not just Christian who has helped, listened and answered all my questions no matter how trivial, every member of staff I have dealt with has been more then helpful, to the point of letting us finish our cup of tea so it didn't go cold, spent time to help and solve problems above and beyond. Thank you to you all, by the way what a car, thank you for listening to all my needs. A very satisfied customer."
2019-03-06,5,Excellent service! Everything was carried out as discussed. Extremely helpful.
2019-03-06,1,"First visit for MOT and service and badly disappointed. Two new tyres fitted but gunk and black mess left on tyres and alloys. Although agreed, car wasn't washed and vacuumed. Urgent cam email sent at 5pm -despite car being with Audi since 9am - for new front pads and discs. After talking to guy looking after car, this turned out not to be an urgent requirement after all! Price quoted on cam email was totally different to paperwork given to me at the end of the day. In fairness after complaining bitterly Audi collected the car the next day to clean it up and offered to honour the lower price quoted."
2019-03-06,5,"This company was very helpful from the off, happy to spend time with us to discuss our needs and not hard sell. Really friendly Anne who helped us from start to finish with the purchase of our new car"
2019-03-06,5,"Very patient and professional staff, nothing was too much effort for them.
I had looked around many other dealerships when looking at new cars and felt Inchape Toyota treated me well and took time to understand what I was looking for.
Would recommend them."

2019-03-06,5,A recent rear brake replacement for my 5 year old very Polo was very well carried out with no problems afterwards. The staff were very friendly a everything carried out satisfactory.
2019-03-06,1,"Car was supposed to be cleaned inside and out. Very poor level of service. The dashboard was half done, the internal doors / back of front seats were not wiped down, the carpets were part vacuumed. It was literally like I had turned up part-way through the cleaning of the vehicle. The externals were ""washed"" but there were a few patches where the existing dirt had been missed completely. I actually had to cleaned the vehicle myself that evening as it looked strange with dirty patches on the bodywork."
2019-03-06,5,Karl and Ben looked after my car and requirements very well on my visit to Audi Maidstone this week. Some may even say the WOW factor!
2019-03-06,5,Very attentive as always. Kept up to date with progress throughout the day and car valeted upon collection. Expensive some may say but you get what you pay for.
2019-03-06,5,"Friendly helpful team, and no hidden costs with service carried out 👍"
2019-03-06,4,"It would have been good to get a vehicle inspection 'checklist' report from your visual inspection, as done by other service agents."
2019-03-06,5,Very friendly ! Good and professional .
2019-03-06,2,"Not a great experience. Replacement car wasn't booked, very difficult to get through to the garage to find out when to pick up the car, and the electric key to our garage which was on the same keyring came back broken."
2019-03-06,5,"Excellent service picked up my car MOT then dropped it off later, exemplary service"
2019-03-06,4,"Polite & Professional. However, I would say there is room for improvement. Once my car had been checked at the service I was sent a video of the issues. I called and left three messages with differing people for my 'technician / service advisor to call me and discuss the findings). They did not call. My wife went back to collect the car! We will take our custom elsewhere."
2019-03-06,5,Very happy with the service from Mini Cobham and particularly Jack Wray who navigated me through the purchase and all the gadgets on the mini
2019-03-05,5,"Very Impressed I was kept updated each stage on the progress with my vehicle !

The staff are proactive and help full !
The showroom is something else !"
2019-03-05,5,"Having just collected my new car, l'd like say without any reservation the professionalism and courtesy of entire team at Cooper BMW Sunderland, especially the reception and sales staff, with a special thank you to Chris Parker, collectively made the experience of choosing and buying a new car a truly pleasurable experience and one I hope to repeat in the future."

2019-03-05,5,All as expected
2019-03-05,5,Had a very good experience when I was buying my car.
2019-03-05,1,"So disappointed with this dealership, visited Cheshire Oaks site on Saturday to be told the sales person who deals with business leases was not in (?). The lady said she would get me a card to call the salesperson in the week, and disappeared, never to be seen again. I tried calling at lunch time, reverted to the 'sales team' extension and continual ringing, no answer, get the impression they do not need the business. Will go to another dealership..."
2019-03-05,4,Very goog serves happy to use again even though I was charged 12 pounds for using my own clips to fit a side panel
2019-03-05,5,"Excellent service, friendly and knowledgeable people. Top class"
2019-03-05,4,Great service thank you all.
2019-03-05,5,Kept up to date at all times and was offered a lift when I was unable to get back to pick up the car

I was served as soon as I entered and picking up a courtesy car took only a matter of minutes.
Car was available on time and, again, service was prompt and efficient"
2019-03-05,5,"Car was booked in for a service. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.
The car was ready when they said it would be, and was cleaned inside and out.
Very happy with the service."
2019-03-05,5,"Listen to all I say and conduct themselves very well. Curteous and polite. The attention to detail is wonderful.
I found the car ready on time and washed.
I have been taking my car to Stratford for 8 years."
2019-03-05,5,"On arrival at the Loughborough Mercedes branch, I was met with a courteous and friendly reception from Sandra on the front desk, who quickly determined my enquiry and auctioned it without delay and directed me to the reception area whilst offering me refreshments as I waited. Within a short time I was greeted by Chris, who made me feel a valued customer and promptly dealt with the booking in of my car and organised the loan car which had previously been arranged on an earlier visit. Chris was also helpful in showing me the layout of the loan car( it was a different model to the one I currently drive) and made sure I understood the driving features of the car. On my return later in the day ,having been phoned to say my car was ready for collection. My whole experience was first class and there was nothing that could be improved on."
2019-03-05,2,"We arrived at the garage about 20 min,s early. handed over the car and asked how long the service would take. The girl on reception then said it would be ready about two o clock this was 09.15 When we asked why it would take so long ,we were told that there were cars in front of our car and they came first! I began to raise my voice
and eventually she said it would finished by 12.00.
yours sincerely M.Lemon"
2019-03-05,5,Very good that’s it
2019-03-05,5,"Dave in the used car section and Neil were professional, swift and excellent in all I required.
I bought a car from them in the space of a half an hour phone call, and when I collected later that week, the process was effortless."
2019-03-05,5,"Perfect service from start to finish, best sales person I’ve ever dealt with. Highly recommend."
2019-03-04,5,"Excellent service especially Ian Farmery with whom i dealt with. Professional , efficent, and informative even picking me up at the station after my trip from Ireland. Car handover was fast and painless would highly recommend. 5 stars."
2019-03-04,5,"No pressure to buy, very easy going with succinct, very clear information provided in regard to models, costs and technical specifications etc.

The collection process was especially well organised considering it was a “new plate” day.

Only small criticism was the lack of available parking spaces."
2019-03-04,5,Excellent service from both sales reps Yin and Demetrius.They demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of their products which helped me to be more focussed in my purchase of a new Jag F- Pace..Well done and thank you for your support throughout making my visit a most enjoyable expereience.
2019-03-04,5,"Very easy to deal with , very knowledgeable sales staff. Very helpful with any query."
2019-03-04,5,Super customer services. Would totally recommend.
2019-03-04,5,"I could not fault the experience of buying my new Mini Cooper S five door hatchback with Inchcape UK. Lee, who sold me the car, was most helpful & informative in helping me to choose the car that suited me best. I had the loan of 1st. a clubman & 2nd. a 5 door hatch (Both Cooper S models) I had the chance to see how they fitted in my garage, as well as testing them both on the road. I am very satisfied that I have made the right choice of car & I am also delighted with the factory fitted options that I have chosen. Lee was very painstaking in showing me the various colours & interior finishes, wheels etc. I particularly like the head up display & the different driving modes, which he demonstrated to me. All in all, I would give 5 stars or 10/10 to Lee & for the experience & professional manner with which I was treated."
2019-03-04,5,All staff were extreamly helpful and courteous at all times giving me enough time to think and make sure I was purchasing the vehicle that best suited my needs a very happy customer
2019-03-04,5,"Absolutely brilliant service. Very friendly and helpful. Thanks to Simeone Redway, very polite and understanding. Simeone went the extra mile to make sure I was looked after. Also like to thank Tariq for the amazing service, made the whole experience effortless. Highly recommend to anyone. Thanks again."
2019-03-04,1,From start to finish the experience I had was poor. I wasn't informed of the progress of my car service and I wasn’t told I needed to rebook for an issue to be fixed. I only found that out when I received the check list and there was no one to speak to about it as they had all gone home. Just wouldn’t get this poor service with Mercedes so I certainly won’t be buying another BMW as I value customer service. The valet I received was awful and I could’ve done a better job myself. The inside of my car has white marks all over the seats and the wheels have only been half cleaned! Think you need to review your showroom slogan.
2019-03-04,5,"From start to finish, excellent service."
2019-03-04,5,"I was served at BMW by luis Walsh. It was my first time purchasing a car and Luis providing all information needed showed the upmost excellent customer service, polite welcoming informative. Upon collection on the car he gave me a very detailed run through on all the electronics of the car. All in all Luis made it a great experience all round and I will definitely be back for my second car."
2019-03-04,5,"Very good dealer thanks to Stephanie Benson and the manager Harps, I'm love with my new mini and I will see you in a few years when I upgrade"
2019-03-04,5,"The service received was exemplary from start to finish - with special mention to Thomas Hurst, who is a credit to Mercedes Nottingham!"
2019-03-04,5,Would highly recommend. Service was great
2019-03-04,5,Lauren was very helpful and very calm when helping me find a new BMW. Cooper Cobham couldnt be more professional and I would recommend them as a good place to purchase a car.
2019-03-04,5,"Nathan Foster gave Great Customer Service
I would recommend to anyone."

2019-03-04,5,"VW Bolton and the staff, especially Damien Dewhurst, have been nothing but great when it comes to me and servicing and booking appointments for my car. They make the process super easy for me. I’d like to thank them for their help."
2019-03-04,5,"This dealer has always been very helpful, efficient and courteous.
They make you feel valued as a customer. We had Hondas for many years before deciding to try a VW. Our current car is a VW Golf Estate with the 1,4 petrol engine. It is a lovely car all round. Easy to drive, frugal (43 mpg overall), comfortable and has enormous luggage capacity while feeling like a luxury car. A previous VW dealer was not so helpful when out Golf Plus developed a fault which is common with golf diesels, so Inchcape have been a good provider from sales to service"
2019-03-04,5,"lexus Leicester offers excellent service. The buying of a new car is a seamless and joyful experience with everyone from reception to finance to salesperson to service Department clued in and offering very friendly and professional advise and options.
You never feel under any pressure as everything is carefully explained.
Keep up this high standards, Lexus leicester.

2019-03-04,4,"A Good customer services experience from Anne and the team at Mercedes Oxford when I purchased a A180 in March 2019.

Although I wasn't able to purchase the car I wanted in the showroom they found me an alternative that met my needs."

2019-03-04,5,"Absolutely 1st Class service from all , especially Michelle who gives it a real family feel of a buisness , takes it personal to deliver an outstanding customer service !!!!

Thanks again BMW Durham

Cheers Colin"
2019-03-04,5,Excellent service and staff. Real pleasure dealing with them and buying a new car.
2019-03-04,4,"Basically good as it usually is albeit with a couple of minor quibbles.

The parking remains a total nightmare and in no way complies with the BMW commitment that you will always be able to park at their dealerships. The staff do their best but there are just too many vehicles on site. To be honest I dread going there because of the parking difficulties and the risk my BMW will get damaged as a result. Also on the day of my visit, the waiting area was somewhat understocked with refreshments compared with my previous visits."
2019-03-04,5,"Very happy with the service I got from Lisa.

Sat Nav was installed and okay to use so far!

Was a bit disappointed as ask when booking the car in could I get help on a few things in the car and was told I could but nobody was there to help! (thank god for YouTube!)"
2019-03-04,1,"I have received poor service from start to finish. Tried to contact stockport branch on numerous occasions and had to leave messages as no answer and they never returned the calls. When I did eventually speak to someone in the correct department they had very little knowledge. I eventually booked my car in and was informed I could wait whilst they did it initially to then find out at a later date that due to the recall I would get complimentary valet and they would need to keep the car a few hours. On the day my car was in I again received poor service, I wasn't informed when mt car was complete and I could collect I had to chase again. I then picked my car up and it hadn't been valeted. They wasted a lot of my time and added a lot more stress to something that wasn't needed. Never use them again will stick with normal garages.

Thank you for your response, following my feedback to VW the manager called me up and apologised and offered me some compensation for my troubles, I really appreciated him calling and discussing and trying to resolve."
2019-03-04,5,"The staff were very helpful and knowledgable
I luv the mini and this is my 3rd purchase from the company"
2019-03-04,5,"My second purchase from Cooper Croydon Mini and couldn't be happier. Andy was great from start to finish, giving great advice and making sure I got what I needed without over selling. So pleased with my new car :)"
2019-03-04,5,"I took my car for MOT and service and had detailed video content from the technician and had great service and care, I was pleased with the work that was carried out and satisfied that I knew my car was done right."
2019-03-04,5,great customer service and overall service of my vehicle
2019-03-04,1,"I have bought many vehicles, and this was without doubt the most unprofessional hand-over experience I have known. We had an appointment at 11:00 pm to collect our new MINI. However after arriving promptly at 11:00 we were informed that despite our scheduled appointment that the salesman 'was with another customer'. After waiting half an hour (in which time he didn't even have the courtesy to walk over to us to apologise) we walked out in disgust and arranged instead to have the vehicle delivered to our home."
2019-03-04,5,"Despite unavoidable change of salesperson prior to vehicle handover, everything happened seamlessly, courteously, and efficiently by both salespeople concerned."
2019-03-04,3,"Booked car in for under warranty works. Some intermittent faults keep coming up. service guy came across like he didn't believe me? From my knowledge the car wasn't even taken out on the road they just plugged a computer in which read no faults so the car was released. Mercedes did advise me that the ECU needed some updates so they did them free of charge, could that have been the issue? Wasn't convinced so I have booked in with another Mercedes dealership from another franchise to rectify."
2019-03-04,5,"Highly recommend:
Very professional. Very accommodating. Dropped car off for service and used their business centre to work from for a few hours - car was ready while I carried on working - Great environment."
2019-03-04,5,"Saw a car on the web site that was at Malton, dropped them an email re a test drive later that day and got a call from the lovely Leon. Popped over for my test drive and bought the car. Leon went through absolutely everything with me and was so very helpful. He is even sorting my private plates out. The whole experience has been really nice, relaxed and easy."
2019-03-03,4,"Great experience, paperwork not fully accurate, log book when received shows incorrect surname. My surname is Lewis not Jones."
2019-03-03,5,Excellent and efficient customer service which I always get when I have my car serviced at Inchcape Romford.
2019-03-03,5,Amazing service
2019-03-03,2,"Our Mini One hadn't been inspected and 'prepped' for delivery in any way. First of all the scratches on the roof weren't dealt with as promised and the side panel is badly marked. The passenger window was jamming and one of the rear lights was out, the result was we could not use the car. We were told to call out Mini Assist as it was a security issue. Their response was very prompt but unfortunately the engineer couldn't fix the problem as the window had been malfunctioning for some time to the extent it was completely jammed open. After delivering the Mini to Barretts of Canterbury it had to be left with them and the engineer brought us home.
When I buy a car from a reputable Mini dealer I do not expect to be checking the car over on delivery especially as it's only one year old. We are now having to sort out the repairs, have the side panel sprayed and roof sorted. To me it was obvious you were aware of the problems and were selling it on the basis that if the customer doesn't see it - that's fine.
I bought my one year old Maserati over the phone, without seeing it from Leeds it was delivered in perfect condition and this is nothing less than I would expect. This looks like a case of 'buyer beware'."
2019-03-02,5,"Hilary Clarke is an amazing sales person. From my initial phone call to book an appointment to completion Hikarubwas engaging, professional and helpful. She listened to all of my needs and words and worked relentlessly to find me a perfect match.
Hilary kept in contact throughout the whole purchase process and often reminded me of everything I needed to do and when (terrible baby brain)!
I am extremely happy and recommend any one looking for a new mini ask for Hilary. I will be seeing her again when I need to upgrade again.
Perfect sales person in every way and makes a brilliant cuppa!"
2019-03-02,1,"I bought a 4 year old Mercedes for 26.5k from Lexus Leicester.
I was given the car with numerous problems, which the garage were trying to deny. I finally ended up getting all the issues fixed after numerous phone calls and emails.
This was broken aircon, rusty wheel nuts, broken drive mode selector, worn out windscreen wipers and a broken boot seal amongst other things.

Inchcape also forgot to change the brake fluid when they done the service before giving me the car.

I told the sales advisor when buying the car that the aircon was faulty and he denied it, it was proven by Mercedes that the car needed a new compressor.

All of these items took many trips to Mercedes to get sorted. This has cost me much of my time, just because Lexus Leicester were initially trying to pull the wool over my eyes to try and maximise their profit.

Considering all the grief I have had with Inchcape from when I bought the car back in May 2018, you would think this may count towards some future good customer service, well this isn't the case.

I phoned the new sales manager at the end of January, having only owned the car for around 8 months, stating that the drivers door has a really annoying rattle that is driving me crazy and the sales manager basically told me that Mercedes were renowned for rattly doors and Inchcape were not interested and I would need to get it sorted myself. A top of the range Mercedes should not have constant rattling in the drivers door, there is obviously something broken in the door.

I bought the car from a main dealer because I wanted a good customer service should the car have problems. This is not the case with Lexus Leicester.

I even paid for a 3 year warranty, which might well be a waste of money as nothing is covered without diagnostic charges and then you still might not get the problem fixed if the 3rd party warranty company decide not to cover it. Inchcape are not clear about how the 3rd party warranty works when they sell you the car and then sell you the extended warranty.

7 days ago Inchcape replied to my review and stated that they wanted to learn how to make the complaint better, so I emailed them twice, they have completely ignored me.
*BE WARNED INCHCAPE HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE*"
2019-03-02,5,Great experience thanks guys
2019-03-02,5,"Nick Dey at Land Rover in Guildford made finding the correct vehicle for my requirements a smooth and enjoyable experience. No pressure, just plenty of clear, accurate info that helped me make a wise decision. I felt he was honest, trustworthy, and sincerely wanted me to have a good experience, which I absolutely did. I will highly recommend him to my friends, and seek him out when the time comes for my next purchase. Top job Nick! Thanks so much! TWB"

Thank you to James & Andy."
2019-03-02,5,I use this garage for all my mini servicing needs despite the fact it is a 70 mile round trip. The reason - they are simply the best. I trust them to do a great job and they do. Thank you for looking after me
2019-03-01,5,Good level of service and workmanship
2019-03-01,5,Excellent customer care. I was kept up to date with the progress.

2019-03-01,5,"Professional welcome, good intro's, knowledgeable and caring staff all round. Gemma was particularly good. Overall a very pleasant experience throughout."
2019-03-01,4,"My initial contact with Norwich was great and James the sales exec had a good knowledge of the car and when questioned about a couple of additions he said this would be no problem. He suggested my wife and I came along to Norwich some 200 mile round trip and inspect and duly made an appointment and paid a returnable deposit to 'reserve' the car. We turned up at the due time and were not expected, James was off ill and no one at the branch knew of our appointment. After some wait Bobby stood in but his knowledge of the car and the BMW system were not up to date but we muddled through and agreed to buy with a small addition for the dashcam and to send a link to BMW insurance on acceptance. When James returned and rang he said that BMW no longer did 7-day insurance and he could not do the wiring as it was not a BMW dashcam!
On investigation BMW still do the 7-day complimentary insurance so when pointed out this was available I was given a access code; I gave up on the wiring. So some promises were honoured others were not.
Despite this earlier irritation the handover and transfer to my home was faultless, the car was great and delivered on time with all documentation etc. hence the 4* rating."
2019-03-01,5,"From the very first contact with the Inchcape Preston staff by SMS message to confirm my booking, the gentle reminder a day before and the warm welcome that I received upon entering the superb dealership, I was already supremely impressed.

I was seated with a fresh hot coffee and then greeted by a Jaguar service specialist who talked me through what work would be carried out and if I had any questions - he was an impressive and knowledgeable gentleman with a kind and caring manner - something that has always been somewhat lacking within the automotive industry I feel.

The service was completed in an impressive fast time, and I was called by my service specialist to let me know that it was ready for me to come and collect. I was again welcomed at the door by the very same service specialist (continuity is key to great service I believe) who talked me through what had been done - the car was driven around to me and it had been completely washed, dried, vacumed and a lovey air freshener was emanating from the car. In short, I was genuinely made to feel like a VIP, everything went smoothly and the team at Inchcape Preston Jaguar/Land Rover are a breath of fresh air - superbly impressed - Thank you all for a genuinely wonderful experience. I felt like I had stepped back into my Jaguar for the very first time again, which made me smile very widely indeed! :-)"
2019-03-01,3,"finance were unable to release the car
Staff did a good job of helping me out when Mini Finance decided to shaft its paying customers. I was very close to walking away from the deal but the dealership staff lent me one of their cars to go to a pre arranged meeting i needed to attend."
2019-03-01,3,Somewhat overpriced and attempted to persuade us to do advisory work which would have cost an extortionate amount given the age of the car. Poor communications internally as to when the car could be picked up after the service and extremely difficult to get anyone to answer the phone in the service dept.
2019-03-01,5,"After my car passed MOT, Cooper BMW Banstead also print out helpful Condition Based Service Data and suggested action for my car."
2019-03-01,5,"Easy, painless experience, highly recommend them. Be assured if this not a throwaway comment - my experience couldnt be faulted."
2019-03-01,5,"Good deal on used BMW,Martin the salesman was very courteous and helpful"
2019-03-01,5,"Went out of their way to help me!

Only comment I would make for change is when I rang on sunday to ask for service (as I had a problem) I was just told to ring back Monday. If I had been asked a couple more questions such as being asked if it was something BMW assistance was needed for and that it was covered as my car is less than 2 years old. I only found all of that out when I called back Monday so car wasn't sorted out fully until Thursday."
2019-03-01,4,Everything was handled well and the salesperson Simon Barnett was very professional in the way he handled the sale
2019-03-01,1,"Was bullied to pay and take the car yesterday (or loose the deposit) when I asked if I can pay the following day (since I could save 3% due to better offers with the payment card in the new month). Offered to pay any charges for the delay which was bluntly rejected saying the deposit will be forfeited (Wonder if this is due to the pressure of meeting the sales target?). At the time deposit was collected, nothing was mentioned orally nor in the papers about the loss of deposit. I can only say think twice before going to Cooper BMW Croydon or Inchcape UK!

2019-03-01,5,Excellent service
2019-03-01,5,Great sevice
2019-03-01,5,"Excellent service and very happy. The one negative is that I have not been able to have another service plan because my vehicle is 9 years old and VW have changed the plan which only allows vehicles up to 8 years old. I cannot understand for the life of me what the age of a vehicle for a service plan should matter. A warranty yes, but the vehicle still needs regular servicing."
2019-03-01,2,"I spent a couple of days trying to speak to someone on the Jaguar side to test drive a used car. After complaining was contacted by a saleswoman on the Land Rover side. I ended up buying the car but since then have been ignored every time I tried to contact her to sort out things she said she would do, or queries about the vehicle. Only one person there helped me with an issue I had and followed up. If you have an option, go elsewhere to buy a car - I would next time for sure!"

2019-02-28,2,"Poor - they didn't even check their repair work and it was was faulty

Beware they have a poor rep locally and it is for good reason

Took my Sirocco to Inchgate as the rear door (boot) wouldn't close - mechanic inspected and appeared competent - quickly diagnosing the issue - called me later and informed me that they had ordered the wrong part (no problem as the car could still be picked up on time) - I tested the door release and quickly realised that the fault hadn't been fixed"
2019-02-28,5,"A real pleasure! The selection of cars was great and the staff's knowledge was very impressive. Very pleased with my new BMW, thank you."
2019-02-28,1,"So looks like the inchcape aftercare are just as bad as the body shop in Chester!! After writing a review I got a message saying to contact tellusmore@inchcape I sent an email of the paint damage to my seat from the garage!!
I had already informed the garage I couldn’t get back to Chester and asked if they could send me to another garage or come out to me and look at the car to which they said they were not willing so I ended up paying £150 to sort their mess out!!
The response I got from the customer service was that it was my decision to go to a third party so they will not be refunding the money!!
Another waste of time from inchcape!!
I’ll hope this review can help someone so they don’t have to go through what I’ve been through, my Mercedes is only 2 months old unfortunately someone crashed into the side of it and I thought I was sending it to the best garage... oh how wrong I was!!!"
2019-02-28,1,"I emailed a complaint to Cooper Croydon on the 28/06/18 and I was told a Manager would contact me, it is now 28/02/19 I am still waiting and I gave up after a couple of chaser emails. The customer service use to be great now is poor at best."
2019-02-28,2,"The Mercedes c220d 4Matic car I bought has a strong smell of cigarette smoke - bad news for a non-smoker! Hopefully Mercedes -Benz Cheshire Oaks management will authorise my local dealer in Coventry to professionally deep clean and remove the cigarette odour which has permeated even the cabin air filters
Test drive wasn’t really enough to discern that the lumbar support doesn’t really support lower back properly : After just 1 day of ownership and 160 miles of driving - back pain has returned with a vengeance : Think I’ll be taking the train far more frequently or use my son’s Polo for local driving. Shame really because it’s great looking car with leading edge safety features - at least the miles will be low and exchange value reasonable in a years time when I’ll find another car."

2019-02-26,2,"Very disappointed today
Arrived at Mercedes warrington. It was chaos.. vehicles everywere, cars, vans double parked., nowhere for customers to park, workmen were partly blocking the one entrance to the site, literally got blocked in so in the end I just left my vehicle blocked In and let the staff deal wiv it.
Waited an hr and 15 for a safety recall I voiced my concerns with staff , didn’t get a sufficient response in my opinion
Only to find that I couldn’t leave straightaway as a transporter has arrived which completely blocked the whole area
Very disappointed today
Will not be returning in the near future 😡"
2019-02-26,1,"We had three tyres fitted at Cooper Ipswich. Although more expensive than say Kwikfit, we choose them because of their expected professionalism, However we were to be disappointed, when we arrived to pick the car up, the promised free car clean had not been completed despite them having the car for three hours and we were told if we still wanted it, it would be another 45 minutes. After a complaint it was in fact done in 20 minutes. even the tyre fitting itself was a problem. After driving it a few miles down the road the tyre pressure warning lit up, so we drove it all the way back. Where we told that the pressures were OK but the warning sometimes comes up anyway. If that is the case, they should have warned us before handing it back. We found them to be reasonably professional in a stand offish way. Top marks to the receptionist who made us coffee a very pleasant lady, who they perhaps ought to think about making better use of. Overall a very poor experience that will make me think twice about using any of their services again, it certainly will not be back for tyres, Im sure any of the mainstream fitting companies would have had you in and out in 30 minutes."
2019-02-26,1,"In for a BMW Recall

I would like to give 2 reviews as the second time when they were doing everything they could to help the rating would have been better. However, I should not have had to visit a second time.

I was due for the standard BMW recall battery connection to be replaced. I had a 9:15am appointment which I arrived for at 9am. This was a while you wait appointment. At 9:30am I was called to say that the car was just going into the workshop onto the ramp and would be done in the next 1-2 hours.

11:25am I returned from my walk to BMW to see my car coming out from ""the workshop"" and thought great that was good timing. I went up to the service reception where the very nice ladies asked me to take a seat. I said it probably won't be long as I just saw my car being parked up as I came up the stairs.

11:45am a BMW employee came up to me to tell me that my car was just going into the workshop for the work to be done and it would be 1-2 hours.
I was fuming. Why had they lied to me in the first place and wasted my time? This is unacceptable, if I did this with my clients I wouldn't have a job any longer.

I told BMW that I wanted the car back as I had a Christening to attend. They tried then to say it would only be 40mins to do the work, but I couldn't wait for that. They had already had my car 3 hours by this point, with no work done just them having driven it.

The car eventually came around for me and I left for home having reset the clock as they had already disconnected the battery (they didn't turn the ignition off). Once changed for the Christening I got back in the car where a warning light came on about batter discharge being high (clearly related to the recall they had started). There was also a large visual alarm showing me that the car was still up in the air on the ramp!

I went back to BMW immediately as this was now a safety warning light, on top of the safety recall issue. BMW was allowing me to drive a car with safety issues one which had been added at the garage that morning.

I told BMW about the warning lights and that they needed to fix this for me. BMW told me there were unable to fix this as they had no space in the workshop. They created the issue in the first place, totally unacceptable. I missed most of the Christening because of this terrible and unacceptable experience.

It's the lying that is my biggest issue. Wasting my time. I might have been able to organise my day better had they informed me they were running 3 hours late (even though it was a morning appointment). They must have too much work that overspills from the night before. Amazing as if I need to get stuff done I have to finish late to get it done. 3 other customers had similar experiences that day just while I was there. It's such a shame as some staff are great and you can tell they are trying, but being dealt a terrible hand.

I fed back to this BMW and they said they would arrange to fix the problem. This has now been done and is as I expected the experience to be. I have however lost trust in the BMW garage due to the lies and way they dealt with the customers."
2019-02-26,5,"excellent customer service, very efficient on completion of paperwork when purchasing car."
2019-02-26,4,Great service and very quick turnaround .this would be a five star rating but let down by the courtesy car being dirty with crisps all over the resr seat and floor.the lady did appologise saying it was dirty when giving over tbe keys .why not if this was known spend five minutes to get it clean .other than that this dealer has it right from a customer experience angle

Most impressed with Coopers Banstead and will certainly go back to them."
2019-02-26,5,"Excellent, professional service in all departments. Ellis showed the excellent quality of listening carefully to a customers needs and then delivering this to the very best of his ability. He was very polite and friendly in a genuine way and never pushy (unlike some salespersons we have experienced in other car dealers).
He helped us to understand all of our options and introduced us to all relevant staff to follow through on finance, servicing and accessories. Each of these personnel were excellent, including the receptionist and people who made us coffee.
Overall an excellent experience with a product to match, thank you everyone.

2019-02-25,5,"Very pleased with Coopers. Took my car there for its first service last week. Friendly and knowledgeable Service Assistant Claire answered all my questions regarding the car. Good to see a female on the service desk too! Felt more comfortable asking “silly” questions
Car was cleaned and valeted and no problems with anything really
Good experience"

""Could not thank Skye enough!""

5See 

We recently bought a range rover evoque from Land Rover Preston. Skye was our Sale's woman and she was extremely professional from start to finish. I was worried I was going to be very pressured to by a car that day (as I previously have been at other garages) and was treated with respect (which again I have previously not been). Skye knew exactly what we were looking for and helped us find our perfect car. She was calm and patient with us from start to finish which resulted in us putting a deposit on a car that very day without test driving it due to it being in another garage. Skye however did give us opportunity to test drive one of her colleagues car. Thank you so much Skye for all the help you gave us when choosing our dream car. You DEFINITELY need a promotion or payrise! Katie and Paul"
2019-02-25,5,"From appointments to viewing, sale, vehicle delivery, customer care, everything was first class. we were thoroughly explained and guided at every step on any questions we had. Got everything as promised. Highly recommended!!"
2019-02-25,5,Brian Sutton gave great service really helpful and made sure I got the car I wanted.
2019-02-25,5,Really friendly staff. No problems encountered at all.
2019-02-25,5,"I unequivocally recommend Cooper York to purchase a new BMW. I have just purchased my 3rd new car from this dealership, I continue to use them as they offer first class customer service."
2019-02-25,5,Good efficient service well looked after.
2019-02-25,5,Really impressed with the service received. Friendly staff and communication was great-I was kept up to date with everything that was happening with my car.
2019-02-25,5,Dealt with professionally.Customer service staff ultra polite and helpful.Car returned within given time scale and feels tighter after service .Well done also therefore to my technician.
2019-02-25,4,Overall a great service with a smile provided by Denice. Just let down by a poor quality car clean.
2019-02-25,5,"My overall experience was good, the sales person was knowledgeable and professional. My only issue was when we went to pick the car up, it was taxed for a full year despite advising we would set it up on DD so that was extra funds that we had to find on top of the purchase price (paid cash). Think the sales team need to ask whether wanting to pay in full or DD and not just assume."
2019-02-25,5,Excellent service through the whole process of buying a new car. Special mention of salesman Paul who kept me informed from start to finish.
2019-02-25,5,"First class experience from selecting my new car to completing all the formalities and driving away 5 days later.
Showroom staff all very pleasant and polite.
All cars for sale look terrific and a wide variety to choose from."
2019-02-25,5,"Easy to book Car in for a service. Polite and helpful on phone. They update you by phone informing you of any extra costs / work that needs doing. They do excellent complimentary valet service (worth waiting extra time for). Efficient, friendly, helpful service giving every confidence that they ensure Is totally safe and secure to drive out. Nice environment to wait in if need be with good coffee on offer and latest magazines to read, if only doctor/ dentist waiting rooms could be like this!!"
2019-02-25,5,Excellent service from Sam.
2019-02-25,1,"Went into Mercedes Liverpool after seeing a car advertised on Auto Trader.

Initial experience was good, even if we did wait an hour to see someone. Test drove the car and chatted about my options and left leaving a £500 deposit (not negotiable).

Went to pick up my car on Sat 23rd Feb and left without it! Let’s just say it was not the car I seen originally. The car had scratched alloys, scratched front and rear passenger door, as well as a chipped window and a bad paint job! I couldn’t believe it and still can’t believe it! I had even paid extra to have a protective paint guard put over the car (explains the bad paint job!).

So how did this happen? I’m still waiting for answers and the car was NOT in this condition when I put a deposit down. I’m adamant they have been driving it without my consent and I will be checking the mileage.

The sales guy who I spoke advised that this has happened before! I couldn’t believe he even told me that. When I started to complain and tell him this is not good enough, he completely back tracked from what he said previously and told me this is a used car and they cannot get it up to the standard of a new car. I was left completely speechless! Even though these damages were not there originally! So after him telling me he would get his manager (which he never did), I went and complained myself to somebody else who then told me this is NOT acceptable and he will ensure the car is sorted!

I was promised a phone call yesterday (24th) and I am still waiting.

My previous car was a BMW and I’ve never had any of this happen with them.

As well as all of the above, I have car insurance running for a car I don’t have. I have finance/bank loan running for a car I do not have.

I could go on but I won’t as I think I’ve said enough."
2019-02-25,5,"Ed was very welcoming, a true credit to the Team at Cooper Durham. The communication was great from start to finish. Thanks again :)"
2019-02-25,4,Well done. Well presented
2019-02-25,2,"I can share this via a telephone conversation
George 07551453112"
2019-02-25,5,First class customer service from start to finish. Alan Wood in particular was a pleasure to deal with at the Preston showroom. Highly recommended.
2019-02-25,5,"Excellent - Mike and the team are absolute stars nothing is too much trouble, great service. Thank you"
2019-02-25,4,"Good, efficient service provided. Having a small child with me the staff were helpful when needed."
2019-02-25,5,Very friendly and easy to deal with
2019-02-25,5,"Very Great Professionals services and excellent customer relationship service.

Paul O'Reilly was very good to deal with me and gave me great customer service."
2019-02-25,5,"An all round pleasant experience. Courtesy car provided, no issues with the level of service."
2019-02-25,1,"The aftersales service has been nothing less than poor , i traded my old car and foolishley left my Ipad and CD case in the boot , as soon as i realised i called and sent emails advising, this was later the same day , following many emails and phone calls those items have not been returned and can only consider them stolen, i feel the delay in responce from the dealership has lead to this situation.

Having spent 44k on a car to recieve such treatment leaves me feeling nothing other than sadened , i do realise it was my own stupid fault but then you really dont expect to have your personel items stolen by such a high class dealership BMW after all this is not a back street car sales location.
when you pay premium you expect premium service."
2019-02-25,5,Great service from Scott and the team. Made the whole process simple with great customer service throughout. Would definitely recommend them!
2019-02-24,1,"The worst experience ever. Awful customer service, Untrustworthy and extremely rude sales executive.
We chose a car that we liked, when we phoned to book for a test drive, the sales executive told us that if we decide to buy the car, it will be delivered to our house at the back a lorry, since we were travelling a long way.
On the day of purchase, we asked about the delivery and the same sales executive, “after consulting with his manager”, confirmed that as a goodwill the car will be delivered to our house free of charge at a back of a lorry. He also said that the car is going to be washed and cleaned, and the tank will be filled up befor it gets delivered to us.
When we left the dealership we felt happy with the service that we received.
On the delivery day, our car was driven by a driver to us. Opposite to what we were told. The car was not clean, and there was a quarter of a tank of fuel remaining.
Tried to contact the dealership twice but the sales executive was not available at his desk. Eventually he phoned us, I told him that we are very disappointed with the service as the delivery method was not what he told us, and also the car has not been cleaned and the passenger side floor mat was muddy. He denied what he said before about the delivery at the back a lorry and said “have I had it in writing anywhere?” I told him that we took his words for it! He said “if the car is not clean to your standard, drive the car back here and we will clean it for you” I told him why can’t they refer us to a branch near us, but he said he won’t do it. Then shockingly he said that he’s got a better resolution, he will come to our house personally and will take the car away and give us full refund! He repeatedly said this. I told him that it’s not about the car and we like the car, it’s about the service and the fact that he gave us false information twice. Then suddenly he hung up the phone! Right away he called back and admitted that he hung up the phone and said again that he will give us full refund for the car, I told him that I do not want to carry on the conversation with him and I would like to talk to his manager. He said that’s fine and hung up the phone again.
After a few minutes someone else from the dealership phoned and after we went through what happened he said that the sales manager wil contact us. Spoken to the sales manager, he offered to provide refund for a full tank of fuel and a full valet.
The headache that we didn’t need after a purchase that we thought had gone through very well. Very disappointed with the unprofessional behaviour of the sales executive. Don’t expect that from anyone, let alone from a brand such as Mercedes Benz."
2019-02-24,3,"The BMW garage in Chelmsford is OK, but is more professional than friendly or helpful. Quality of work seems OK, but the time taken in waiting to drop off or collect your vehicle is excessive (nearly 20 minutes to collect car on last visit)."
2019-02-24,5,"I have just bought a used car from Mercedes, Liverpool. The purchase could not have been easier, I got a decent price for my car, and they advised me what to do in order to get an extra two years warrenty and breakdown cover for free. Jake, who looked after me, even came in on his day off to hand over my new car, brilliant service. Couldn’t be happier!"
2019-02-24,5,Brilliant service throughout !
2019-02-23,5,"My car was serviced at Inchcape. I was greeted by friendly, efficient staff. I received a video of the service of my car with recommendations of any jobs that may need doing in the next few months, ie: tyres replacing.
Very happy with the service provided."
2019-02-23,5,"My wife's car had 2 recalls. On the day of the fix, BMW York made a compementary visual check of the car, The BMW Mechanic found both the rear alloy wheels had cracks on the inside of the Rims, making them unfit for purpose. I was sent a email with a attached video of the visual check to verify this, A excellent service in my opinion.
The car also had a vibration whilst driving. I was reassured by the service team that the vibration was probably the result of the cracked wheels. I can tell you I have replaced the wheels and all is well. Thank You BMW COOPER YORK.
I found the whole service easy and straight forward. I also use them for parts, and i find the parts team all very friendly and helpful."
2019-02-23,3,"Salesman’s was very polite and knowledgeable. Offered to pick me up when I returned to collect the car from Chester train station. Bad bits, made an appointment to test drive the vehicle had to wait over an hour on the day of the appointment as another customer arrived early, as part of the deal I was told my train ticket would be refunded. One week later I have not had confirmation that this will be paid. Overall the whole the process was rushed, my first Mercedes very mixed feelings over the quality of service offered"
2019-02-23,5,"Excellent service rear windows replaced after Toyota recall.
Service Advisor Warranty Administrator Clare Harfield was excellent."
2019-02-23,5,"The service was excellent as it was booked on a date and time convenient to me, my vehicle also being ready at the agreed time. I was very satisfied with the explanation of work carried out on my vehicle. Everything has gone through the conditions previously communicated with professionalism, efficiency and competence.
Thank you very much!"
2019-02-23,4,"Overall very happy the car is great, the service very good,from the Salesman and the finance team also the technical advisor
Was very good talking me through the
I drive system and the special features.

Only point to raise was the mount of paper work to sign seemed endless and I am not sure that all was really necessary
Oveall a very pleased Customer"
2019-02-23,5,"I have just purchased a used Range Rover from Land Rover Preston. From start to finish Martin supported me through the purchase even taking the time to come in on his days off to make sure I was looked after. Great service, lovely friendly team and best of all a fantastic car. I would recommend Land Rover Preston to family and friends as a great experience on a major purchase."
2019-02-23,5,"I could not fault the service whatsoever, the staff were excellent and
resolved the problem very quickly."
2019-02-22,1,"Very disappointed. I decided to make the 3 hour journey to pick up my new mini to find it was not ready despite 2 phone calls to check it would be ready for collection as I needed to make the 3 hour journey back home and into work for which I was subsequently late as was my partner. Agreed with the salesman I would arrive at 0830 hrs to collect my new car.

Car was not valeted, tyre issue warning message, which I was assured by the salesman would disappear as the tyres had been checked, 1.5 hour delay in collecting. Did not manage to leave until 1000hrs, at which point due to the delays I was unable to 100% check the car.

All the excitement of collecting my car was eroded by the constant delays and lack of honesty from the salesman. The state of the car was appalling and not to the standard I'd expect from a garage of this calibre.

I now have to pay to get the car properly valeted and potentially a new tyre as the tyre pressures were all wrong on the car and could actually be slow puncture.

This is the 2nd BMW garage whereby the service is appalling and I have lost all trust that they advise the truth."
2019-02-22,5,Very good and Becky was very helpful
2019-02-22,5,Communication is very important to customers kept me informed before and during.I like being called to a desk with a one to one everything is clear calm
2019-02-22,5,"Just bought a GLC for my wife, i was looking for two months for this certain spec and model i dealt with Warren McDowell who found me the perfect car within a week excellent from start to finish highly recommend, thanks again for all your help"
2019-02-22,5,Service completed early as requested.
2019-02-22,1,"You are fraudsters, dishonest, and have ripped off people who have some mental malfunction. you falsify an application to the finance company and inflate their income in order to make a sale.The staff you employ on sales are disgusting and despicable,liars and cheats and should not be employed by you. Coopers should not be trading on behalf of BMW,they should have the franchise removed by BMW.
You do not conform or comply with regulation 13 when you flout it.
You do not deal fairly with people who do not have the capacity to understand. Even when requested not to proceed, because of this condition your staff told lies and went ahead regardless. In carrying out this despicable act, the stress that you created for us as well the many thousands of pounds it cost my family is shameful and needs to be shown to the general public, motoring organisations, Trading standards and the Financial Conduct Authority"
2019-02-22,1,Got browbeaten by a manager who refused to give me my deposit back on a car they had brought in for me to view. Despite being told this was refundable he said I owed them for transportation of the car. Salesmen should make this very clear and not tell you that you get your money back if you don’t want the car. I won’t buy from them again despite buying new cars there previously. Customer service was rubbish .
2019-02-22,5,"From the moment I entered the showroom I felt welcome and all staff acted in a highly professional and courteous manner. The video health check following the job was extremely useful and I would recommend this Dealership without hesitation.
Particular thanks go to Aimee for her excellent customer liaison skills and technical knowledge."
2019-02-22,5,Professional and friendly service
2019-02-22,1,"Coopers Croydon - Absolute Shoddy Service

My rear parking sensor was not working and I booked in my vehicle 2 weeks ago just before I was about to go on holiday. I called them on two occasions to confirm the date and to confirm the parking sensor would be in stock. The assured me both from the parts department and the service department saying that the associated parts had all been ordered and there was nothing to worry about, just to bring the car in.
So taking a day off work, I took the car and arranged a lift back as they said it would need to be there all day.
After taking the key, they realised that no one had ordered the parts and there was nothing they could do about it. When I asked to speak the manager, he came out and simply said mistakes happen innit.

This is a BMW dealer and this is 2019.
Absolute shoddy service skills"
2019-02-22,4,"Good courtesy car
Polite and helpful staff member dealing with me
Fast service"
2019-02-22,5,"Just bought my first BMW from the Sunderland branch, Gary who was my salesman was extremely helpful and went out of his way to provide an excellent service, and gave me a fantastic deal on my car.
He kept me up to date throughout the car buying process, and cannot thank him enough for everything.
I will be back in the future when I am ready to change my vehicle and certainly will be dealing with Gary again.
Once again thanks for everything and I cannot wait to driving my new BMW"
2019-02-22,5,"Booked my SMART car in for service at a time to suite me. Prices were all discussed up front. They rang and confirmed it was still all OK. Did the service, explained everything clearly and the bill was what they said. Car washed and cleaned before picking up."
2019-02-22,5,Exceptional service team.
2019-02-22,5,"Great customer service - Highly recommend
After having a pretty poor experience at another dealership, Cooper Banstead was a breath of fresh air. Everyone i dealt with was professional and efficient. Work was completed timely and at a reasonable price."
2019-02-22,5,Servicing made easy.
2019-02-22,5,"the salesperson, Alan, was excellent and made the experience more enjoyable"
2019-02-22,5,Excellent service.
2019-02-22,5,"I have purchased two cars from Cooper BMW Malton and can highly recommend the dealership. Eddy, Paul and their colleagues provided excellent service on both occasions and I will certainly return if and when the time comes to change again."
2019-02-22,3,"Staff very friendly and helpful. Let down by poor condition of car on collection. Stone chips not repaired and interior very poorly cleaned. (muck,dust.bits of straw, hair and an old receipt found under and around car seats.Nick Thomas very helpful in putting things right.But I feel that if the presentation was poor then what more important aspects of pre - inspection were missed."
2019-02-22,5,"This was our first visit to Coopers of Malton. Unlike other showrooms they were very attentive, not pushy,, and was treated no different for buying a used car as opposed to a new one. . Everything was explained with accuracy. The after care was second to none. Every member of staff that we met was very professional and nothing was too much trouble. Would go back 100%. Well done to the team and Martin for a good experience"
2019-02-22,5,Excellent service and communication throughout
2019-02-22,5,I was very impressed with the service especially the video of the problem. Also the great touch of cleaning the car and the gift of cleaning materials. Thank you
2019-02-21,5,My whole Mini experience has been brilliant start to finish. Clare Pepper has been amazing and I can’t thank her enough for helping me find my dream car at a even dreamer price. I’ve never felt so looked after and never enjoyed a shopping experience as much as I have this one. The whole team were able to really personalise their service to me which helped me to feel comfortable asking questions that I wouldn’t have asked else where. I know buying a new car is exciting but the team at Mini Tonbridge just put the cherry on top for me. A million thank yous for your absolutely fantastic customer service!
2019-02-21,5,"very pleased with the service from inchcape and the help I received from luke and charlotte good luck ,and long may you continue."
2019-02-21,5,"friendly and efficient service, including transport to the station. Whoever vacuumed the car found a bracelet of enormous sentimental value - what a wonderful surprise, seeing it there on the seat. Thanks."
2019-02-21,4,Impressed with the competent handling of my purchase. Did not get a 5* due to lack of communication sometimes and few bits about the car that was not resolved before the car was sold to me.
2019-02-21,5,"} very professional, not pushy, friendly, helpful, competent and with a good knowledge of the cars they are selling, would definitely recommend and would return in the future"
2019-02-21,3,"When arriving end up waiting for 20 -30 mins to be seen by the service representative.
receptionist walks from front desk and hands post it note in with details to the service team, surely they should have a simple intercom or instant messenger system would be a bit more slick/professional.

The service went well and info provided is fine. its the delay in being seen at the start."
2019-02-21,4,Very good service and efficient.
2019-02-21,1,Poor advice - this is not a service centre I would recommend
2019-02-21,5,First rate service at Telford Inchcape as I have come to expect.
2019-02-21,3,"We bought a Jaguar Epace over a week ago!
I have a number of points which need mentioning:-
(i) quality control - having driven the car home the next morning my wife spotted a small (11/2 inches long) on the driver's door;
(ii) the salesman made a a real effort to assure us that he would contact within a couple of days to ascertain whether we had any problems (see Above). No call as yet even though I emailed him as soon as we arrived home to thank for his efforts. This was not even acknowledged! A lilies rude!
(iii) to speed up the handover process Jaguar York passed on to us a sheaf of documents for signature. This we did having carefully read what the paperwork was all about.
We are still receiving the same documentation on a daily basis more than a week later!"
2019-02-21,2,"I was disappointed with the service I received at coopers bmw in cobham, my car went in for a recall, while I was there I was being treated differently to the paying customers, there was a woman going around asking other customers if they wanted a tea or coffee but didn’t even look at me.

The last time my car went in for a recall, at the end of the service they sat me down on the service advisors desk and read my car key for any faults and went over what they found with the car and gave me the paperwork to show what had been carried out, this time they did not do this, I just got told to meet the service advisor at the front of the building.

After 10 minutes of waiting he pulled up in my car, I have a dash cam installed in my car with the wiring all hidden in the headlining, when my car came out the wiring had been pulled down and was just left hanging there, the car was also meant to have a complimentary wash and vacuum but it wasn’t, when I said to the service advisor about this he said they do normals provide this service and seemed reluctant to have this done for me, he then said hang on and il quickly take it back round leaving me waiting outside, he comes back with the outside quickly washed but still not been vacuumed. I said to him you shouldn’t tell customers you are going to do a complimentary wash and vacuum if you have no intention of doing it to which I didn’t get much of a response.

I will not be using their service again, I’d rather drive further to use the next nearest garage than use them again."
2019-02-21,4,"Very pleasant sales person Knew his product and was very respectful & polite
The only downside was the time spent waiting for the salesman to come back to me whilst he was dealing with the finance when I didnt need any ending up with a finance plan to get warranty
No test drive offered but I know Mercedes
The other thing I didnt like was the finance test of memory.Good job I had my file with me but asking me detail without prewarning was I felt unprofessional"
2019-02-21,4,Good service very helpful face to face but not the best at returning calls.
2019-02-20,5,Kind and friendly staff as always
2019-02-20,5,"Everyone I dealt with was helpful and pleasant. Always greeted by a smiling person when you arrive and never have to wander around looking for someone to help you. Someone comes out to help you and is very good. Understands what you need and is helpful.
The only problem is finding somewhere to park the car when you come."
2019-02-20,5,I had a warm reception and was well updated on the state of the car service.
2019-02-20,5,Very efficient and issue resolved quickly.
2019-02-20,4,"Although there seemed to be some confusion when i telephoned on the Saturday prior to my booking on the Monday I can say with true conviction that the service I recieved from Daniella was outstanding. She kept in regular contact which was a massive help to me and my car was returned, serviced, fixed and all three recalls had been adhered to. Thank you Daniella and team inchcape."
2019-02-20,5,"Recently bought a mini cooper-countryman from these people with a great deal of help from Sophie in the main showroom.
Excellent service, nothing was to much trouble and really appreciated a call from her several days later to make sure everything was okay with my new car. Would certainly go back and use these when the time comes to re-new my car
many thanks"
2019-02-20,5,"Very welcoming, well look after, outstanding service."
2019-02-19,5,"As always BMW were efficient, helpful and friendly. My only complaint would be that the valeting was not as good as usual and most of the windows and screens were not clear."
2019-02-19,4,"My mini copper was due its first service took it in on the 18th Feb,2019, Staff very friendly & polite. Informed when booking that part of the service on TLC was a valet and wash. The valet unfortunately wasn't good. The car still had scuff marks on inner door frames inside, dust on dash board only evidence of valet was hoover. very disappointed.
Also asked if blue tooth could be looked at as not linking to phone but never mention on collection of car."
2019-02-19,1,"Continuing the saga from yesterday’s review still no car and no contact from BMW. Eight phone calls later managed to speak to someone other than a receptionist. He found the car at 3pm and promised the routine checks would be done next. It would then be delivered back at the end of the day.
Again tonight no car no phone call! Unbelievable this garage is completely unreliable."
2019-02-19,5,Many thanks to Stacey at York Cooper mini for finding me my perfect car! I’m absolutely delighted with it and enjoying driving it.
2019-02-19,5,Quick to drop car off and collect. Hassle free
2019-02-19,5,"Visited Cooper, York for a new mini. Good experience with Stacey spending a lot of time advising us and we are extremely happy with our new car."
2019-02-19,5,"Friendly no pressure sales environment, I was given all the info I required and a vehicle demonstration that allowed me to make an informed purchase. Call backs and appointment times / dates where kept as arranged, Salesman ran me around to pick up my PX on collection day. Purchased car was used C Class and it was immaculate when collected, scratch on body work was removed and scuffed wheels were repaired, both looked like new. Salesman was friendly and attentive. Pleasure doing business"
2019-02-19,5,Our sellman james was very helpful and very polite very knowledgeable and when he couldnt answer our question he went and found out nice greeting being offered by staff
2019-02-19,5,"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT. cant fault anyone working at BMW.
steven [salesman] was very helpful. hope to be going back in near future. Mr Brown and Not Mrs Brown [ops]

Raymond Brown"
2019-02-19,4,"Very good service. Parts were not available as they thought, but they recovered the situation by reducing the cost and booking my car back in as soon as possible."
2019-02-19,1,"Worst ever experience I've had with what is meant to be a reputable company! Bought a car from the Volkswagen Wirral branch on Saturday 16th and put down a large deposit and was told it would be delivered on Wednesday, received a call extremely late on Monday 18th to be told that the car had too many faults and it would not be cost effective to fix therefore they could not sell me the vehicle. I was told they were working on a replacement vehicle and I would receive a call the following morning. Did not receive a call and ended up having to chase it up with them, the salesman James was extremely rude and unhelpful and kept passing the blame to the salesman who was apparently off work, after insisting to speak to a Manager I finally received a call from the general manager who was also rude and condescending stating to me 'we do not have to sell you the vehicle' I am still in shock at the lack customer service and the way I have been treated. Both the General manager and the salesman were aware that I have a newborn baby and this vehicle was badly needed as we currently have no other transport, total lack of empathy and not what I need at an already stressful time. I am totally upset by the whole experience and I urge people to stay away from this garage. I am hoping to receive a full refund for this vehicle this afternoon. STILL AWAITING REFUND!!!"
2019-02-19,5,"I had a recall on my Toyota Aygo due to a manufacturing problem with the rear window.
The service that I got was second to none from the moment I arrived and was met by shamoon Iqbal to when I collected my car the same day.

I also had a free health check that included a video by email of the check and informing me of the visual safety report that I then collected when I collected my car.

Excellent customer service from the reception team to the service team highly recommended."

2019-02-19,1,"Was informed by a staff member that an issue I had with paint blistering could be covered under a 6 year warranty, so my vehicle was booked in. Subsequently told that it in fact was not covered as the warranty only covered 3 years. My actions were based on incorrect information passed to me by Land Rover staff"

2019-02-18,5,"Impressed with reception team, admin and Jamie the sales consultant- he was very helpful, professional and answered all my questions and enquiries nothing was too much trouble. I loved having 48 hrs to test drive a mini, really helped me decide and so far I love my new Mini Cooper. I have given overall excellent for service etc. To make the experience even better I have to admit it would have been lovely to have some sort of ‘reveal’ as I did some years ago when I bought my other new mini - I have to admit I was a little disappointed and it would have made collecting my mini a bit more special 😔"
2019-02-18,5,"We received excellent service throughout our buying experience having initially visited just with a view to looking at a particular model whilst we were trying to narrow down our vehicle search down.We were treated at all stages in a professional manner with excellent communication and customer service, our dealings were mainly with used car sales and Ian from that department We found Ian to be a pleasant young man who was not pushy and was patient,he assisted ourselves with good advice but ultimately allowed us to make our own decisions"
2019-02-18,4,"Great dealership and great service, however loan car stank of cigarette smoke which wasn't very pleasant."
2019-02-18,5,"Really pleased with the friendly, personal service received from Shamus for a recent car service with Mercedes Oxford. Reasonably priced service through service plan and no quibble warranty repairs. Would highly recommend based on this experience."
2019-02-18,5,A very pleasant experience. All staff were polite and helpful especially gavin who went above and beyond to make us feel important and in helping us to make a well informed choice . We are extremely happy with our new car and all it’s featuresx

2019-02-18,5,"Always a pleasure taking my car here for a service. First class staff with such a warm welcome. Looked after from start to finish from both everyone i encountered, always remember visiting a different car manufacturers show room, and it wasnt a patch on Cooper BMW. Excellent from start to finsih."
2019-02-18,5,"Excellent service Zac was friendly knowledgeable and a pleasure to talk too
Nothing was too much trouble and I never felt pressurised"
2019-02-18,5,"Good service for my service! Was done by the time I needed to collect the car. No complaints. (Although I had hoped that my car might have been cleaned, as my husband had his BMW washed when it went to for service at the BMW service centre)"
2019-02-18,5,"Amazing service, timing and communication"
2019-02-17,5,"I travelled from London to Chester to test drive the used Audi I'd seen online and I wasn't disappointed. I was looked after by Mateusz who was helpful, knowledgeable and never pushy, plus he made sure I was comfortable, had enough cups of tea and that I was completely happy with my choice. I'm thrilled with the car and buying it was an exciting and pleasurable experience."
2019-02-17,1,"Having bought a new car from Mercedes Warrington, it is currently scheduled to go into the dealership for the sixth time to try and fix a rattle from the dashboard. I have tried to reject the cat but have been informed that a rattle doesn’t constitute grounds for rejection as they should be able to repair it. Well after five visits it still rattles. The dealership fail to reply to emails or return my telephone calls adding to my frustration. Having bought a new car you would expect trouble free driving or at least a speedy resolution to the issue and / or to keep the customer informed. This has not been my experience when dealing with Mercedes Warrington.

Following your reply, I’ve sent you some videos and emails sent to try and get this matter resolved. I will post further if anything gets sorted, however from my experience to date when dealing with Inchcape I doubt this

As expected, still no contact from Inchcape, awful customer service!"
2019-02-17,5,"Friendly staff, knowledgeable, excellent follow up and a great fun car to own."
2019-02-16,5,"Excellent service from BMW and Matthew Scott , Coopers Teeside"
2019-02-16,1,Car went through a health check while there with screen washers rated as fine but failed an MOT 2 days later due to non functioning screen washers.
2019-02-16,1,"Went to collect new car and when I arrived it had not been valeted and was very dirty inside to be told that it had been done but not very well. They had touched in stone chips with the wrong colour and was told well it’s a second hand car. Offered to valet car for me but I declined as they couldn’t do so at the first attempt. As for the touch up stick for the chips, I was told that I could have a used one but not a new one! They asked if I could come back the following week so they could valet the car and re-do the chips, again I declined as I had travelled two and a half hours to get there. Also had to wait an hour once I arrived as the car was not ready even though they had two weeks to prepare it. I asked for a very small reduction to get the car valeted elsewhere as the chips re-touched in with the correct colour to be told no. Disgusted by Cooper Tunbridge Wells BMW and would not recommend to anyone."
2019-02-16,5,"Very helpful and knowledgeable , job done quicker than original time estimate and car returned in better condition than it arrived in."
2019-02-16,5,"Fantastic, speedy and very friendly service! Would definitely recommend using!"
2019-02-16,2,"Due to poor communication my experience on this occasion was very stressful & I did not end up with the features on the car that I was expecting. I did receive a payment of goodwill, but sadly this didn’t make amends for what had occurred.

I have purchased many, many new vehicles from various dealerships, & I can honestly say none have left me feeling so stressed! Would I opt to use this dealership again? Very unlikely!"
2019-02-16,5,Very polite and efficient service.
2019-02-16,5,"I took my car to Audi in Stockport for a free healthcheck which included checking for possible suspension or tyre damage from potholes. I was very impressed with the service I received, all the staff I spoke to were extremely friendly. I loved the fact they also cleaned and valeted my car even though it was a free check. I also liked the video that was emailed to me."
2019-02-15,5,"Friendly, approachable and everything explained in great detail. No hard sell which was very important to us. Would 100% recommend."
2019-02-15,5,Top class service from start to finish.Thanks guys the car drives like a dream
2019-02-15,2,"Very polite staff and very thorough video of the MOT and detailed paperwork given. However, I disagree with the ‘failures’ as some of the things mentioned do not constitute an MOT failure, no-one returned my calls for over 30 minutes when I called back after receiving a message on the day- which wasted a lot of unnecessary time- and the cost of the work is double what I’ve paid at any other garage i.e £84 for a new windscreen wiper!! Extortionate. I therefore decided to lose the £39 cost of the MOT and go elsewhere. Will not use a Toyota garage again. It also took a long time to finalise details on completion and receive the keys back."
2019-02-15,5,Excellent service and very professional
2019-02-15,5,"Very good, car was serviced while waited. I sat and worked on the free WiFi and drank decent coffee."

Absolutely fantastic"
2019-02-15,5,"I visited Cheshire Oaks Audi on the 14th of February, Valentine’s Day. My car, A4 Avant was due its major service. I was greeted by a very friendly and professional reception team member who took me to the customer waiting area and also made a really nice cappuccino too 👍. Phil Groom handled the servicing of my car and organised a courtesy car well. The whole servicing procedure and cost was explained in detail and the courtesy car handed over as well. I was very impressed by the whole experience at Cheshire Oaks Audi and found it to be extremely professional but also very friendly too"
2019-02-15,1,"Do not use BMW Thames Ditton for car service. It is appalling.

Arrived to collect my car and completely ignored. Had to go find my service agent myself, even though car was ready.

Car is driven up uncleaned: blocked in so couldn’t do it was the excuse.

Service monitor was not reset: computers down, couldn’t do it. You will have to bring it back.

Tried to leave but blocked in with many other customers by skip lorry for the garages metal waste. Arrived at 1650 but didn’t get away until 1750. Mechanic told me it was always like this.

£400 for first service, not cleaned, service monitor not set, got to bring it back, hour to pick up.....could it get any worse.

Last time they forgot to secure the engine cowling so it rattled so had to bring back and you always have to wait ages.


Don’t go here!!!"
2019-02-15,5,"First time I've use this dealership. Very impressed, lovely staff and everything done on time."
2019-02-15,1,"Very poor booking service, advised I would be dropped of home and collected again later by the call centre only to be told by the young lady that I would have to find my way back and it wasn’t her problem, apparently the booking centre always do this. Great customer service NOT! Whilst in the car getting dropped off home I shared it with two other guys and one had been waiting two hours for a lift home and the other was told his courtesy car was not available as they had overbooked."
2019-02-15,5,"Aaron has been great, love the car, the process has been a delight from start to finish!"

2019-02-14,1,"Cooper BMW are a complete joke. Do not use. I have been fobbed off with regards to 2 faults because when they plug the OBD2 in it does not come up with anything!! Not mechanics or technicians, just fitters."
2019-02-14,5,Great customer service
2019-02-14,5,Excellent service. Friendly staff. Feel valued as a customer. X

2019-02-13,5,I would recommend Mercedes Garage Leicester. I am not the easiest customer but staff provided very efficient and respectful service to me. Thanks a lot for your help.
2019-02-13,5,"Great service - brought my car in for safety recall check. Whilst doing the safety check Toyota completed a car health check. Few things needed doing, they've sent me a video confirmation and list of recommendations. My car was ready for me to pick by the end of the day, so fast and efficient service."
2019-02-13,1,I have submitted my complaint 3 times now and have still not even received an acknowledgement of that. Awful service from Mini.
2019-02-13,5,Very busy but very professional Company
2019-02-13,5,"We have just bought an Audi A3 Saloon from Audi Stockport and we couldn't be happier.
We had the pleasure of having Josh Kennah look after us and he was absolutely fantastic - from start to finish nothing was too much trouble.
I would definitely recommend Josh as a ""go to"" if you are in the market for a new car."
2019-02-12,5,"Your member of staff was very responsive on what my needs and criteria of what i wanted in a car and done there up most to meet my needs .
I would like to give a massive thank you to one staff member in particular and that is Sophie she went above and beyond to help me choose a car .
Thanks so much 5* ratings all the way"
2019-02-12,5,"Bought an NX here in February 19.
Very straightforward process, paperwork dealt with promptly, all questions answered in plain English and nothing too much bother.
We weren’t pressurised in any way but equally were made to feel welcome when we went in and test drove etc.
Helpful, friendly knowledgeable staff that tolerated our over excitement and complete ignorance about buying a new car!"
2019-02-12,5,"Excelent service, realy helpfull staff ,car looked after realy well service carried out while i waited 10 out of 10"
2019-02-12,5,Great experience and great car. Thank you
2019-02-12,5,"Glen was very informative, allowed me the time to ask as many questions as I wanted which were answered in a language I could understand.
There was no pressure to buy which is very rare.

All in all an enjoyable experience"
2019-02-12,4,Good service very attentive in ensuring you are informed of all things with your car.
2019-02-12,1,"Should be 0 star for this customer service! First time booked my car for warranty service and of course nothing been done! Gave me back broken car! when after couple of days I start understanding my car having same problems went to different garage and when check it, discovered that nothing was done what been told me. Very sad, so good cars with so poor customer service! No one absolutely not care about clients!"
2019-02-12,4,"Impressive in all areas
The invoice was confusing when there was nothing to pay.
And the car could have been cleaned better... that’s what lost the final star - was a bit disappointed that internally the little recess area in front of the arm rest was not wiped and that externally it had dirt patches still. I understand this is a complementary part of the service however I get it regularly cleaned inside and out. It was due but I thought seeing as it was having a wash and vac this would not be necessary.
Fantastic email updating me that nothing needed doing though.
And being open til 6 was useful.
Thank you!"
2019-02-12,4,"I visited Cooper Tunbridge Wells for work to be done on my car. I used the waiting time to get measurements of the X1 which I may be buying. I wanted to check on entrance height,width and Passenger seat hight.
The Salesman Mr Dean Mayer was helpful, and had good product knowledge. I was able to collect the information I wanted.at my own pace
I was asked to provide information about myself and the car that I will be trading in eventually. I did stress that I did not want to be ""followed up on"". We shall see.
All very straightforward and only time will tell as to what and when I buy.
Terrible job selling cars. I envy none of them!"
2019-02-12,2,First time I have used this garage in years. They have gone for the tech approach emails phone calls text messages and videos of your car. Would have preferred they didn’t wake me up on a Saturday morning to confirm my Monday appointment. I also didn’t like when he said can I see your driving license and he went off and photocopied it without asking. They seem to be trying a new approach to customer service and totally missed it.
2019-02-12,3,"Had to wait 50 mins for valet after agreed pick up time, and did not clean inside fo car. Emily my host was great however."
2019-02-12,3,Waiting around along time before any one even acknowledged I was waiting for service even though I was waiting in the service area.

2019-02-12,5,"We recently purchased a pre-owned BMW 1 series from them, the service we received was fantastic and we had 100% confidence and peace of mind the car was in great shape with all the proper BMW checks. Rebecca looked after us and couldn’t have been more helpful and lovely to deal with."
2019-02-12,5,"From the minute I sat down with Ben to check my car in for the MOT I received brilliant customer service, I was shown to a comfy customer seating area and helped myself to a lovely free hot chocolate. Ben kept me informed throughout my visit and even showed he back to my car when it had been cleaned. I felt very looked after, thank you Ben. The only negative was receiving the video during the MOT a day late, if any work had needed carrying out it would have been too late. Surely you should receive the video during the 2 hours the car is in for the MOT."
2019-02-12,5,"Brilliant customer service, very helpful and polite."
2019-02-12,5,Please with service we have been given by Scott.
2019-02-12,5,"Cooper Cobham is the only and best BMW garage ever for me. Highest possible standards and the kindest customer care. I have bought 3 BMWs from them and I have always been looked after so well that I shall never leave. I have just had another top service from the garage again. This in particular is thanks to his manager Lewi Fasulo who gets out of his way to care and look after his customers. He has an excellent team with Henry Tanor and Oliver Clayton and in the sales Alex Miller. I am sure they will look after me in the future, too, when I decide to change my car.I trust Lewi and his team. They are not just salesmen but honourable and professional people. They have earned my complete trus."
2019-02-12,5,Easy transaction greeted swiftly by considerate people and dealt with well by a friendly sales man
2019-02-12,1,"Having waited over 8 weeks to have an appointment to have work carried out under recall, I returned within 5 minutes of picking up the car, as a fault had developed since I had delivered the car that morning. I knew it had developed that day since all the radio and heater settings had been left unchanged since delivery of the car, that morning . I was told that “it can’t have been caused by us”. I insisted that I wasn’t happy, so I was given an appointment for testing ......in 6 weeks time....and told it wouldn’t take long to review the work done. However when I dropped the car off I was told it would take half a day, so I had no option but to walk home (approx 5km).
Later that day I returned to be told that they had located two problems which could possibly be related to the the problem but that they were sure they had not caused it. There was no explanation as to why the fault had occurred whilst the car was on their property and under their care.
There was no acceptance of responsibility nor any offer of goodwill
Now all my BMW owing friends (including my wife) know of my dissatisfaction and I will try to never use this garage again"
2019-02-12,5,"Prompt service, with friendly cooperative employees"
2019-02-12,5,"From deciding on my Mercedes to ordering and taking delivery, Curtis was excellent throughout. I was updated regularly. everything was fully explained and was dealt with a courtesy and professionalism I would expect from a prestige dealership.

2019-02-11,5,Fantastic experience lovely friendly people.took us over to Cheshire oaks called us when the car was ready . First class service. Thank you all very much see you next year
2019-02-11,1,"A disappointing experience overall, with damaged left to the interior of my vehicle without any explanation or warning in advance. I ask for my one touch system to be fixed through the waranty, not damage the window control panel in the process.

It is unprofessional that someone has put the components back together knowing full well that there is damage and not reported it. I assume that they wanted me not to notice and all would be ok, unfortunately this isn’t the case when the vehicle is my reward and pride of hard work."
2019-02-11,5,Great service and looked after us every time we any questions. A brilliant dealership.
2019-02-11,1,"Total chaos, utter shambles, dreadful customer service, no communication - the list goes on. My car was booked in for a service 2 weeks later than I wanted it to be because that was the next date that a loan car was available which I need to get to work. The evening before the service, I was called to say that no loan car was available. No time to make alternative arrangements and the service was close to overdue so I had no choice but to take a very last minute day off work. Arrived to find the place in total chaos, my car was not on the list apparently (it must have been - I was called the night before about my booking) and a very rude receptionist clearly sick of dealing with all the chaos and unhappy customers she must have to deal with on a day to day basis. Towards the end of the day, I had had no update and was, by this time, dubious that my car was going to be finished on time so, not wanting to be left for the weekend without a car, I attempted to call the service team for an update. No one answered the phone. I rang every phone number and tried every extension until finally someone answered in a call centre miles away and said they had the same problem. Finally got hold of someone who told me my car was ready. When I arrived at the service desk to collect my car the waiting area was so full of people waiting for an update on their car that it was standing room only. One guy I spoke to said he had dropped his car off a week ago for one day and was still unsure if it was going to be ready to pick up that day as no one was able to update him. He had already been waiting an hour. Once again, I wasn't on a list so had to wait for someone to recognise me from that morning and to match me to my car. I was there for at least 40 minutes before I was able to leave with my car - the guy who had already been waiting for an hour when I arrived was still there when I left. I hope he got his car back for the weekend. You really need to improve your customer service. I bought the service pack when I bought my car from you so have no choice to bring it back another two times. I am already dreading it."
2019-02-11,4,Manufacturer's recall
2019-02-11,5,All done in the time they said it would take and car washed and hoovered out!
2019-02-11,5,Very helpful and knowledgable about theee product and services being offered
2019-02-11,5,i can honestly say that they did wonderful job at inchcape derby had full service and they also did recall on airbags at same time car was also cleaned inside and out before being brought back.
2019-02-11,5,I can never be bothered with reviews but these guys are an exception. Everyone I met was really personable and helpful. The whole experience of buying a used vehicle from them was a pleasure and I'd recommend them.
2019-02-11,5,"We bought this car online. A lovely detailed video was sent to us prior to paying deposit. We then went to collect the car and met David who was our contact. He was thorough and charming.
A delight to deal with. So pleased my daughter has contacted David as she is looking for a similar car.
The only downside was he hard sell on the 'other products', by someone else we had to talk to. I didn't like that one bit."
2019-02-11,4,"A good experience overall. Slight hiccup on arrival for a 1030 booked MOT, I was advised that the Service dept had me booked in for 0900.
This necessitated a delay and meant I was actually in the reception area for just on 3 hours, just for an MOT.
The booking is done on a centralised system, so I am not aware where the confusion arose. However I could have done without the wait.
Otherwise a good experience"
2019-02-11,5,"I may be biased as I have been a Mercedes customer for several years now but I really don't think I ever want to change - the staff are friendly, the waiting area is just right with refreshments if you want them, and the service I received this time round made it so easy for me to change my car - thanks Calum, loving my (nearly) new A Class"
2019-02-11,5,"Just got my first BMW from Cooper Teesside. Peter Boyd-Cross was a professional and fantastic help, he was informative and reliable and made my experience enjoyable and fun. Love my gorgeous new car, and again thanks to Peter can get the most out of it as he explained all its features. Would definitely recommend anyone to get a new BMW here."
2019-02-11,1,"Absolute nightmare. Should be 0 stars!
Really quite appalled with the service. Spent a small fortune on 'repairs' to coils and injectors (I had a flashing engine warning light on the dashboard) and 5 minutes after leaving the garage having been told that it was 'all fixed', engine warning light was came back on. My dispute with them is ongoing but I've lost ALL faith in this garage. All they have offered is for me to take the car back for a 'free' diagnostics check.
They referred me to BMW UK customer services, but when I called they referred me back to the garage.
Avoid at all costs. My experience suggests they are untrustworthy.
1. they did not carry out the work that would have resolved the original fault and
2. they then showed complete neglect by not testing the vehicle properly before assuring both me it was ‘fixed’.
3. and I'm £1,544 poorer for the experience!"
2019-02-11,1,"After many years of driving Mercedes, both myself and my wife are now driving different marques.
I cannot think of a single good experience with this dealership, following many visits to both Mercedes Liverpool and Cheshire Oaks. The last time my car was booked on for warranty work, I waited 4 hours before the car even went into the workshop. On a separate occasion, my wife waited a whole day to be advised that they would need the car overnight. Her car was booked in to rectify a faulty brake warning light. She was told she needed new brake pads and disks at a cost of more than £400. The following day the brake warning light came on again and we were £400 out of pocket.

I do not have the time to list all the poor experiences and enormous time wasting in visiting these showrooms but can merely advise we will not be driving a Mercedes again."
2019-02-10,5,"Great service from Adhir.
We walked into Derby Toyota back in June last year, not looking to buy a car, just browsing. He explained the Toyota Hybrid System, We thought all electric cars had to be plugged in. How wrong could we be. Not only was it explained, but we were taken for a ride in a hybrid, where he explained in more detail.
We walked into the garage a couple of weeks ago, starting to make more serious steps to change our second car. We were greeted by Adhir, who surprisingly remembered us. He kept in touch and arranged a test drive. I was hooked.
On Friday a drove home in my Yaris Hybrid. Thank you to Adhir, Rob and all the team at Derby Toyota."
2019-02-10,5,"seen by a very helpful gent by the name of Callum ,gave me a comprehensive walk through on the new car , overall it was a first class experience"
2019-02-10,5,All staff friendly helpful etc. Dropped us off at the shops. Picked us up. And gave the car a wash. What more could I want?
2019-02-10,5,The staff here were very helpful and accommodating to my requirements for my particular purchase. The car is excellent in every way and for money to quality ratio it was excellent. I travelled from Glasgow to buy this car and it was worth the effort as far as the distance required to get there. Would recommend this dealership to anyone.
2019-02-10,3,"Work carried out efficiently but when being quoted to repairs, a complete rip off!!!
So definitely won’t be giving Mercedes my business."
2019-02-09,5,"Jonny Hudson at the Norwich Land Rover dealer made the purchase process a breeze, would definitely recommend."
2019-02-09,5,"Quick and Clear.
The sales executive was really professional and supportive. I really appreciate her charisma and understanding."
2019-02-09,5,I had a routine service all done very efficiently and friendly. Price as quoted no nasty surprises
2019-02-09,5,"BMW 330d - recalled for battery connection leads. All work done in excellent manner. Motor collected - new battery supplied and fitted - inspection done - wheels, tyres, brakes, under body - video supplied. Valetted car returned. Great performance Craig and guys [as usual]. Well done - keep up the good work."
2019-02-09,5,"Very good experience. I’d done all the research so knew what I was after, especially after finding an approved used GLC at a really good price. Gavin was excellent, answered all my questions, proper test drive rather than just round the block. Eb who sorted the finance was great too. Everything properly explained and the front reception staff are lovely."
2019-02-09,5,The first time taking my Mini for a service. Pleasant area to wait and complimentary coffee appreciated. Car wash and inside vacuum a bonus!
2019-02-08,5,Fast service and a reasonable price. The young service officer was very good.
2019-02-08,5,"Excellent service!

Just bought my new car from Cheshire Oaks. Absolutely fantastic service from start to finish.
My salesman Jay was great, a total credit to Mercedes. He was able to answer all my questions and made me feel like a valued customer, something that is sadly lacking in today's busy world!! I really enjoyed buying my car.
Exceptional Service!
Well done Mercedes - Benz"
2019-02-08,5,"I arrived on time and all was ready for the car . I was told that the car would be ready in two hours time and it was. I waited at the showroom and was offered, and accepted, an excellent cup of coffee while sitting in a comfortable seat. The results of the service were discussed with me in terms that I could understand ( no jargon ). All in all an excellent experience. A friend recommended Inchcape to me and I would have no hesitation in recommending them to others."
2019-02-08,2,I recently got a car on pcp. My handover did not go smooth as the guy who had done my sale a week later no longer worked there so no one knew what was going on. I was promised my private reg plates made up in my boot which were not there. When I was sold the car I was told Bluetooth audio was available. So after another trip (26 mile) back to BMW to pick up my plates I was then told that actually the car did not have Bluetooth audio which I had been promised. The staff who took over my sale were very nice and attempted to help my situation.
2019-02-08,4,"Another major service completed at 101500 miles, at around 10000 miles a year let's hope that the car lasts another 10 years. No problems nice people to deal with, the cost are creeping up faster than inflation."
2019-02-08,5,"Helpful, friendly and professional staff. Clients are made comfortable in a pleasant showroom and offered refreshments. The product range speaks for itself. The after sale service has maintained the standard."
2019-02-08,5,Very pleased
2019-02-08,5,"Helpful, pleasant. professional and straightforward experience. Very pleased with the car."
2019-02-08,5,Superb service from start to finish
2019-02-08,5,"Fantastic service from walking through the door not knowing exactly what I wanted through to picking up the keys.

Everyone is clearly out to make your car buying experience a great one. Special thanks to Paul Raynor who helped me find the perfect car and made sure the whole process was smooth and efficient!"
2019-02-08,1,Rubbish service don't give updates was told only going to be 2hrs max and actually was 4hrs will not be going there again!!!
2019-02-08,5,"Exceeded my expectations. Helpful and friendly all round from car collection, to service receptionist through to concise video recommendations. Even topped my adblue up as part of the service check over."
2019-02-08,5,Our sales consultant Jeremy wa terrific. He really cared about our needs and took the time to ensure all our questions were answered. Excellent
2019-02-08,5,"A very pleasant experience with everything explained in detail. Excellent communication, before during and after the recall. Car was returned ahead of expected time cleaned and valeted throughout."
2019-02-08,5,"Very good service as always from Inchape. Collected and delivered vehicle back on time with all works undertaken and car presented in a very clean condition.

Always keep me updated on cost of service/items which is really appreciated."
2019-02-08,5,Excellent customer service
2019-02-08,5,Great customer service and a relaxed pressure free experience. Will happily deal with them again and recommend to friends and family.
2019-02-07,5,Martin Bucklow was very professional and his product knowledge was second to none!!
2019-02-07,5,Great experience. Went the extra mile. Thank you Aadam.
2019-02-07,5,Brilliant experience from start to finish
2019-02-07,5,"The new dealership location and building is impressive but it is the staff that make customers want to come back to use them. And in this case all the staff were very helpful and acted as great ambassadors for the brand. Perhaps they were not busy at the time, and this may change accordingly to customer numbers in the dealership, but everyone we spoke to made us welcome and valued - not an easy trick. Lets hope it continues and any future cost cutting does not impact this USP. Oh, and the car service and valeting was excellent."
2019-02-07,1,Just the worst service you can get. Even when you email them to complain they ignore you. Don’t use Thames Ditton Bmw unless you enjoy having your time wasted and getting a large bill for you inconveniencing then by giving them business.
2019-02-07,1,Service was awful. MOT. My car was ready after 1.5 hours. BUT it took another hour of waiting before they got around to returning my key. No explanation of what was going on. A complete shambles. Many customers were in the same boat. BMW Thames Ditton is to be avoided!!!
2019-02-07,5,"Excellent service. Prompt efficient service. Pleasant, professional staff. Extremely satisfied."
2019-02-07,5,"Excellent sevice from the staff ,
In comfortable surroundings and will have no hesitation in using them again ."
2019-02-07,1,"About as far from premium customer service as you could get.
Drop-off was a slow process. Collection was far worse.
Agreed a collection time during drop-off and was a promised a phone call prior to this to confirm the car was ready. Nobody phoned.
An hour after the arranged collection time, I phoned them and was told everything was ready. It wasn't.
After arriving, being greeted and told someone would be with me, I had to wait 40 minutes in the freezing waiting room for someone to see me to take payment and return my car.
I complained to the service manager (Kevin ??????) who wasn't very interested or apologetic. He did offer to investigate, and called back the next day, confirming my version of events but again sounding like he didn't care, and offering nothing to make the situation right.
There really is no reason to return to Jaguar Guildford - they're a shabby little outfit who are utterly removed from the premium brand values of Jaguar."
2019-02-07,5,very pleased with the service and helpfullnes of the staff my first service on my BMW
2019-02-07,1,"Absolute joke, manager doesn’t want to speak to anyone, car was listed at two different prices on different sites so check autotrader and inchcape. ended up paying more for a car than it was worth, service wasn’t done when due, no MOT certificate so probably hiding some advisories and after driving the car out of the garage it’s now back in with a fault that the technician diagnosed straight away so obviously didn’t have the 120 point check done before coming to me, positive was that dan the sales man was very apologetic. Let’s wait and see the outcome of this disgrace service is as promised it would be sorted and negative experience will be made into a positive, be very careful when buying a used car from here service is very slow as well"
2019-02-07,5,Excellent service and follow up. Would recommend
2019-02-07,5,They done a good job...finish at the time they told..and good customer servecr from the BMW staff.
2019-02-07,5,First class service. Nice people and efficient
2019-02-07,5,Excellent service. The man who served me was exceptionally helpful went went out of his way to assist me with queries not directly related to the service I was there for. I was also delighted to find the team had pumped up my tyres and topped up my washer fluid which probably wasn’t part of the service but was greatly appreciated. Thank you.
2019-02-07,2,"Coopers are the main BMW dealer locally so I’ve been inclined to use them although their customer service is generally poor. Because of a recall on my car I booked it in to get repaired. It took some weeks before they were prepared to do the work. Their processes are slow. You end waiting longer than when you go to AE with a cold. The receptionist takes you to a waiting area - in this occasion I was only left there for 15 minutes. In the past I’ve tended to walk out after 30 minutes so can’t comment on how long it might take. Eventually somebody calls your name, gets you to sign away your rights and takes the key. 6 or 7 hours later I received a call to say the car is ready. Back to the waiting room I go. You get offered coffee but I don’t want to be there. I want efficiency. You can opt to have your car cleaned but unless it’s already clean I wouldn’t bother. They tend to leave uncleared areas all over the bodywork."
2019-02-07,3,"OK but got the impression they were trying to add additional earning opportunities to the initial recall work - and, although not a real issue, having offered a pre-collection car wash didn’t actually do it. Feel they weren’t too interested once I didn’t take up the ‘add-ons’ - shame, since I’m in the market for a new car. Guess I’ll look elsewhere."
2019-02-07,5,"Jen was competent professional and concerned for the welfare of customers,"
2019-02-07,5,"Great video, great service."
2019-02-07,5,"Very professional and polite service. Car was recalled to have a modification on egr valve, They give the car a complementary health check and send me video of this taking place with advisories of work which will need to be carried out in the coming months."
2019-02-07,4,"The arrangements for booking were below standard - I was given one date by the Call Centre in Norwich but the driver turned up to collect the car on another! Fortunately it wasn't a problem so the service was able to go ahead. Once that was sorted everything went smoothly and the staff at Croydon were courteous, there was good communication and the car was dealt with and returned to me spotless. A pity that the booking arrangement was so poorl"
2019-02-07,5,"Good experience all round. Called in on spec as tyre pressure warning light on.
Problem was nail in tyre and this was removed and tyre repaired.
Also did video health check which was interesting to see.
Gave me advice on setting up bluetooth after I mentioned to receptionist that I was having problems. ."
2019-02-07,5,"From the moment we arrived until the time we drove our mini away the service could not have been better. Nothing was too much trouble for our salesman, Glen who was only too happy to go over any queries."
2019-02-07,5,"Quality care done with a smile. Reliable, quick and very efficient."
2019-02-07,2,"So many staff wandering about, no customers buying cars and still no one asked if they could help me with a potential purchase when I was looking at a new car in the showroom. Waiting around for a “personal service manager “ is unnecessary and tedious. It took much longer than promised to recalibrate the windscreen and miraculously the car was ready after I asked how much longer I would have to wait. I believe it had been ready for a while but no one had told me."
2019-02-07,5,"Thanks for all the support , great place and customer service"
2019-02-07,2,"Inchape Shrewsbury
I live in Leicestershire - That is a 118 mile round trip.
I visited the above store on Saturday 29th Dec to view, test drive and purchase the car. This transaction was dealt with by Michael Stephenson who has a complete lack of customer service skills. When we took the car for a test drive we took it to a local car park where we took a good look around the car. During this time Michael proceeded to check the football results and message his friends on his mobile phone! After 30 mins Michael received a phone call from a Manager asking where he was? As far a I am aware there isn't a time restriction of how long you can take a car out for a test drive. Especially when we are spending a lot of money.

When returning back to the sales garage we discussed purchasing the car on the agreement that the scratch on the bottom of the drivers door would be fixed and a new alloy placed on the rear drivers side. Based on this agreement I was happy to place my 500.00 deposit on the car.

I then advised Michael that I was going on holiday the following week and would therefore would like to collect the car on Sunday 13th Jan. To which Micheal said "" We don't sell/exchange or allow collection at the weekends"". This I know is a complete lie as when we were there on the Saturday a lady was collecting her new car!
I said to Michael that this would be the only day I could collect as I had no access to a car due to mine being written off in a recent car accident.
Michael then said "" *** it, we will do it. Just as long as you are here by 10am on the 13th""
Fine. Not a problem.

On Sunday 13th Jan we arrived at 09:55.
We were greeted by Michael. I had to sign some paperwork before he took us round to view the car.

When we got to the car you could clearly see that the scratch had not been fixed!
This shocked Michael who said "" I checked the car the other day, but it was in the dark"" What good is that!!!
He then began to flap saying a lot of ""erms.."" and "" I'm sorry guys I've ****up""
I told Michael to go and speak to his Manager and tell them about the situation and what can be done to get it rectified ASAP. Michael returned to advise that the best thing they could do would be to keep the car, get the scratch people to come out the following day to fix it and then have the car driven to me in Leicestershire. To which I said ""No. Under no circumstances am I leaving this car with you. You made me get here for 10am knowing full well I had spent Saturday travelling back to the UK. You had 2 weeks to sort this. Go back to your Manager and say that you need to find a local garage near to me who will either come to my house to fix the scratch or I take it to them.""

The Manager agreed this and I would receive a call on Monday to advise.
I then drove the car home.

Whilst driving the car home the tyre pressure warning light came on. We took the car to a local petrol garage to check the pressure of the tyres which were fine. However the car was not registering the new alloy tyre. I have a picture of this if you wish to see it.

I emailed Michael straight away and asked him to call me on Monday to let me know what the problem was.

It got to 17:15 on Monday I had not received a call or an email from Michael acknowledging my email sent on the Sunday so I took it upon myself to contact him. Michael said that they would need the car back to investigate and fix the problem. So would like to collect the car the following week and leave me with a hire car.

I suggested taking it to my local Volkswagen garage for them to investigate, fix the problem and charge to Shrewsbury accordingly. This was not a option apparently.
So when I asked about collecting/returning the car would this be done on a transport vehicle? The answer I got from Michael was that they do not have the facilities to do this. Absolutely shocking!

I asked Michael to get his Manager to call me back. Dion Eastwick (The Manager) called me back and said that they needed to investigate the problems raised ""In House"" and so would need the car back to do this. A hire car would be delivered to me, my car would be collected and returned with a full tank of fuel. This is fine, however what I am not happy about is the extra 118+ miles that is going to be adding to my car through no fault of my own. Dion by passed this and said he would call me on Wednesday to advise me of a date for the work to be carried out.

I never received a call on Wednesday from Dion. I had a call on Thursday from Michael who said that the work would be carried out on Wednesday 23rd Jan.
The car would be collected around 7-8am, the hire car dropped off, car taken to Shrewsbury, get fixed and brought back the same day. Based on the track record so far I don't hold much hope. I told Michael that the hire car MUST be an automatic (Like my car, as due to the car accident I can't drive manual cars at the moment, which he is fully aware off. When informed at point of sale). Michael went silent. After a few seconds he said ""Er ok I'll make sure that you are given an auto.""

Thankfully an automatic car did arrive and they collected and returned my car with all of the issues corrected.

I wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase a car from this dealership as they don't deliver on their promises and you may drive away with an unsafe car."
2019-02-07,3,"I was let down by the salesman who was dealing with my car sale,car needed to go back in to have a scratch and small dent sorted as it was not done before I picked it up as promised.only given one key on day of pickup,was told all paperwork was In folder for me, but when checked there was no mot paper,that had to be sent through post,the manager had to step in and sort it out in the end and all paperwork was sent by him correctly,salesman just did not do what he said he would."
2019-02-06,5,"Excellent service from Sean and Michael , love the car. Thank you"
2019-02-06,3,Whilst the service was fine (as was the collection and delivery service) but the vehicle had been booked in 2 weeks previously for the service and for some vehicle recall work. The parts for the latter turned out to be unavailable on the day so I am going to be without the vehicle for a 2nd day. This inconvenience could have been avoided had anybody checked and told me the previous day
2019-02-06,5,I have had my car serviced at Inchcape again as I they are always courteous and helpful.
2019-02-06,5,"After receiving excellent advice from David Rubin at Mercedes Southport I ordered an A200 auto executive which I collected last week. After 350 miles I am now quite familiar with the car and can honestly say that having owned 8 previous new cars, this is by far the best in terms of comfort, multitude of controls, handling and night driving with the LED headlamps. I am absolutely delighted and have no hesitation in recommending David as your starting point in choosing your new Mercedes. It's also the first automatic I have driven and will never go back to a 'manual' again."
2019-02-06,4,"Patient and helpful service. Step by step process which involves a fair bit of paperwork and signatures.
Friendly sales team emphasising the positives. Reluctant to raise any issues. Buyers must do their own homework."
2019-02-05,3,"Not a big fan.

Very hard to find a space in the car park. Had to queue for 20 minutes to wait to put my car in for service.

Had an oil service, car only a year old, went in without any problems but after service oil warning message saying oil is empty and needs topping up. Had to return the next day, didn’t get a full explanation but I suspect they forgot to refill the oil."
2019-02-05,5,great help with buying my car
2019-02-05,4,My BMW was in for a health check and diagnostics check and was done thoroughly with excellent communication and top class customer service. I received a quotation for ongoing service plan unprompted. Excellent.
2019-02-05,5,Very efficient service with comfortable business lounge to work in whilst the car was serviced and cleaned.
2019-02-05,5,Great friendly staff. Beautiful new dealership. Quality service.
2019-02-05,5,"Great service very efficient and polite staff. Picked up my car called me to say it had arrived at their garage, sent me a video of my health check so I could see what they were doing. Delivered my car back within 3 hours. Very happy customer would definitely recommend!!!! Thankyou!"
2019-02-05,5,"It was the first time that I have used Oldham VW, I was working in the area that day and booked my car in for a 1 hour service.

The car was all sorted, cleaned inside and out all within the 1 hour slot.

Great service. Thanks"
2019-02-05,3,"My experience in purchasing my new vehicle from BMW Croydon has been challenging to say the least. It is clear, several areas require significant improvement in the art of 'Customer service'. However once my matters were escalated, the level of service I received met/exceeded my expectations. Disappointing such basic matters required this escalation first!
A special thank you to Adele and Richard for your help in changing my views on BMW New Car Sales, or your rating would have been two stars."
2019-02-05,5,"Kezendra was excellent, a real credit to the company. Her service was superb from start to finish ,

Kind regards , Oliver Gregory"
2019-02-05,5,"Booked the Jaguar in for a service with a bit of trepidation. This was based on a previous dealership experience. Decided to drive twice the distance to Inchcape York and I am pleased that I did. The customer service from start to finish was first class. Greeted by smart, polite staff and dealt with professionally by my Service Advisor Amy. Loan car, Range Rover was ready and I was quickly on my way. Collected my car at the agreed time with no surprises.
Restored my faith in main dealer's.
Well done Inchcape Jaguar York."
2019-02-05,2,"It was possibly the worse buying experience in over 30 years. Both Retailer and Mercedes head Office to me were very unprofessional. Ie: On first contact the Salesman was helpful and a deal was negotiated. From then on it all went down hill. The finance advised that I would need to put in 20% deposit which was a big leap from a £1,000. The Saleman said there was no more that he could do and gave us a code and number to telephone MB Head Office ourselves which I promptly did. From thereon in I was toing and froing between the dealership and MB Finance and was constantly advised that the HO had no record, so more calls back to the Dealership which they were not forthcoming in replying. When they finally did call me back they gave me the number of the Underwriters to ring upon which I was advised I would need to email them as they do not deal with anything over the phone. I emailed the Underwriters and they did reply promptly advising that as I was a previous customer they would accept a 10% deposit and surely going forward this should have been something they could have discussed with the Salesman or the Saleman could have spoken to them about. I bascially sourced my own finance and made the sale possible which the Dealership could quoite easily have lost. Also we travelled by train to collect the car and one of the staff came to meet us at the train station. I was with two other gentlemen. We got in the car and the person driving drove like a lunatic impressing no one. One of my colleagues is an ex fireman of some 35 years service (just retired), and said he had never been in a vehicle driven at such speeds in built up areas and on dual carriageways on the short journey from the station to the dealership. I would be very grateful if someone could contact me on my mobile 0794 121 8041 to discuss the above."
2019-02-05,5,Great car and service thank you
2019-02-05,5,Efficient and courteous.
2019-02-04,5,Excellent service from Mercedes Benz at Derby. Very helpful staff and the car was valeted beautifully when I picked it up. Also getting a full years warranty from the main dealer is an added bonus.
2019-02-04,2,The receptionist was pleasant but she didn’t ask if I had any specific problems with the car so I assumed the would find out my number plate lamp bulb wasn’t working and my rear water jet wasn’t working I thought they would be checking things like that so I could choose to fix them if they miss simple things like that your better off going to a smaller independent that are thorough and sometimes a little more personal.
2019-02-04,5,Great customer service from (Farhad Ahmed) at Volkswagen Oldham. It first experience with this dealership and I was very satisfied with all the efforts the Volkswagen team made.
2019-02-04,2,Too busy very long wait coffee machine not working not good lounge to sit for 4 hrs
2019-02-04,5,"Absolutely a fantastic experience. I looked at several cars, but was nudged towards the one that is indeed best for me, regardless of price. Very very happy. Third car I buy from the same dealership and will do so again."
2019-02-04,2,"they were very interested at first when i made the enquiry and placed £100 deposit but how that changed. Suddenly not massively flexible when they found out i was not taking their finance, comment 'I make money from Finance'. However, i purchased the M4 as it was the model i wanted and on the day of collection was basically walked out to the car and handed the keys in the car park as if doing me a favour.

other dealers and manufacturers make a big deal when presenting the car, walk you through the controls and all the function.

couldn't wait to get rid of me.

Really not great service."
2019-02-04,1,"Car went in for a recall, they decided to check it over and snapped off the repaired dipstick holder resulting in a big oil leak over the engine bay and drive on getting home. Mechanic never said a thing.
If they stuck to just doing the job they were meant to it would have been fine"
2019-02-04,5,"Bryan went out of his way on several occasions to find me the right car at the right price. Have to say how pleased I am with my car and the service received from Inchcape, thanks everyone."
2019-02-04,1,Was given a hire car whilst my car was being serviced with no fuel in the tank....also was promised my car would be cleaned. Very poor attempt.
2019-02-04,5,"Have used this dealer a number of times now with different cars and would highly recommend them. Very pleasant and helpful staff, straight forward process of getting your car booked in and having the work carried out. Great range of facilities on site to make your visit more worthwhile."
2019-02-04,2,"We were booked in for a 90 minute brake fluid change and I phoned a few days before the service to say I needed new wiper blades installed as well. The parts department said they could do it and told me how much it would cost. In the end we were at the garage for over two and a half hours and the wiper blades were not installed as agreed. At no point were we asked what we were booked in for so that we could confirm the work to be done to the car and nor were we given updates on how long it was going to take, we were just left in a cold showroom. This was our first ever BMW service and I was extremely disappointed in the customer service."
2019-02-04,5,"First time I have used a dealership to buy a used car and had serious reservations at the start however the whole experience was first class. The main factor was the professionalism of the member of staff (Sophie) that I was dealing with. Highly developed inter-personal skills, excellent product knowledge and a relaxed and friendly personality all helped to make the experience very enjoyable. This young lady is a great asset for the Company. Paperwork did not take long and away I went ! Very pleased with the purchase and would recommend this Company to others"
2019-02-04,1,"In booking the car in was told no collection or courtesy car available.
Explained I would need the car back that day.

Very disappointed, booked car in at 740am.
Needed an MoT and brake oil change, phoned at 15:00 to find out no work had been carried out.
Explained needed the car back that evening, and told to collect at 6pm.

Arrived to be told the car brake fluid had not been changed and asked to wait.

Waited a further 40 minutes.
Car not cleaned as promised and no quote (costs) received for faults found in the MOT.

Steve Callow"

2019-02-04,4,The arrival and organisation was very good. Communication was good through the day. What was not so good is that I asked for a couple of issues to be looked into and I had to chase these up as I was not informed out of the outcomes. Follow up questions I raised have not been answered.
2019-02-04,5,"Fairly new member of staff sold me my new car after traiding my old 2 series, along with help from a manager, they kept up the brilliant sales team customer service i have always experianced at BMW cooper Croydon in the past. Hope the service center team overall have improved and will offer/provide a better experiance for me with this purchase as i have not been impresed with the after care customer service in the past. Love my new X3"
2019-02-03,5,I have no hesitation in recommending Mercedes Benz Nottingham as I have been extremely impressed with the excellent customer service skills Bilal demonstrated whilst ordering my new Mercedes A Class. Bilal kept me updated on progress and was extremely helpful throughout the whole process. Very good purchasing experience which was smooth and hassle-free. Thank you.
2019-02-03,5,"Great service, couldn't do any more."
2019-02-03,5,"Helpful, polite and efficient."
2019-02-03,4,"Grace was a brilliant sales person, helpful, gently persistent but I didn't feel pressured."
2019-02-03,5,"Katie Needham was first class keeping me updated
With weekly progress on my order. When the car arrived she pulled out all the stops to ensure a smooth handover very professional"
2019-02-03,5,"Respectful, polite, helpful ! , bought what I wanted with no fuss ."
2019-02-02,4,"Ok, I should have arranged a hire car really, but as it was a first service I thought 2hrs top, went in at 10am not back until 1445, bit disappointed really, staff were generally pretty good."
2019-02-02,1,"Took our Range Rover in for a replacement key on the 15/01/2019. Should have been £600 but negotiated to £498. During fitting they crunched the end of our USB phone cable. Service Manager said he would send out a new in the post. Rang a week later and they had forgotten. I chased three times with them and they said they had posted one but second class. Today (2/2/2019), still no cable. I rang them and they told me to buy one and send an invoice and they would pass to Senior Manager to consider reimbursement. Its a £5 cable for the record. I am not short of £5 but if this is how they do business I will never go there again despite several previous purchases. I will AVOID"
2019-02-02,5,We recently bought a mini cooper. We dealt with Dan Temple. Easy to deal with and no pressure. Would definitely recommend them. Very pleased with the car too !
2019-02-02,4,"Aadam our sales contact was excellent. This was the first time we had purchased a Mini. We live in the West Country so expected approx 3.5 hour drive to the dealership. It turned into a 5 hr journey due to traffic being gridlocked around Sunbury. On arrival there was no apparent customer parking which is why we gave only four stars. It was the end of the month so the dealership was busy which meant a long wait, eventually we saw the car we were buying as the light fell at dusk. After an explanation of the controls. We set off on the journey home at about 17.30 hrs. With the heavy traffic congestion we reached Fleet Services on the M3 at about 20.00 hrs when it was just beginning to snow. The weather got progressively worse the further West we travelled, and cars were being abandoned, but we were able to keep going. At no point did the Mini let us down. It was a long journey in very heavy snow, with some very steep hills, but we were able to keep going getting home at 23.00 hrs. Sue my partner had never driven an automatic car before, or in heavy snow. She and the car were perfect. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a Mini to anyone. The car kept us safe and got us home."
2019-02-02,1,"I have a Mini Cooper Hatchback purchased new in 2017. It’s a great car but recently I’ve had issues where the alarm goes off unexpectedly and the boot lid unlocks itself. This is apparently a known issue with Minis like mine. January 10 2019 the alarm went off during the afternoon and I couldn’t reset it for some time, I called Thames Ditton to be told that they were busy but could fit me in on February 5, not very helpful at all. I called Mini Emergency and they agreed that the situation was serious and that they would send someone out to tow it to Thames Ditton where they would have to accept the car for emergency repair.
In the ensuing three weeks I’ve had a replacement hire car and have been waiting for some parts as they had none in Germany? BMW owns mini so I wonder where in China manufactures these spares.
None of this waiting is down to Thames Ditton but their problem is the total lack of communication from the service department, the reception people are great and very helpful and they go over to the Service people who say that they will call but never ever do. They never answer their phone and this will stop me ever buying a car from them in the future.
I’m still waiting for the car but am promised it on Monday, we shall see!

I believe their problem stems from selling too many cars and having a service department that is too small."
2019-02-02,5,"The service at Liverpool Mercedes dealership was excellent, the sales team was knowledgeable and not pushy. They ensured that the car that I purchased was in first class condition and I felt that they went the extra mile to make sure that I had a very positive experience throughout.

I would highly recommend this dealership and and if like me you have to travel to view a car that they are selling, you won't be disappointed."
2019-02-02,5,"Brilliant service from start to finish, can't recommend them enough ! Thanks so much !"
2019-02-02,5,Not much to say really. Everything went perfectly. I was kept up to date at all times and the delivered car was spot on. Many thanks to Steve Barden
2019-02-02,3,"My initial appointment was cancelled due to ""lack of staff"" on the 20/12/18 (good office party?) and was rearranged for 31st January 2019, long delay?

Since making the second appointment my vehicle had developed a secondary problem so I called Coopers 3 days before the appointment date and asked them to investigate, they told me no but there might be a chance that they could and that someone would call me either way. Needless to say NO call was made or received to let me know so I eventually gave up.

When I arrived to book my car in they told me that my car didn't have the button fitted that I had booked to be replaced! Because for the second time in 2 months they had my car designated as my previous vehicle which would have been 9 years old! Is this efficient or good customer service? The job was duly completed and when I picked up the car it had not been valeted or cleaned which I thought was standard practice for a BMW dealership?

I am not at all happy with the service I received from Coopers (recently and 4 years ago) and having given them a second chance since the purchase of my current vehicle (from D. Lovett in Hungerford) I will not be using them again as they treat me as if I am a nuisance and disturbing their equilibrium! They also never call back when they promise to do so."
2019-02-02,5,Great service from Kidlington. Finished my vehicle on time and kept me updated. Cost was slightly lower than budget. Always friendly and efficient.
2019-02-02,5,"First time buying from a main dealer and I was super excited after booking my appointment to see Simon Norris.
Simon was very attentive and patient with my stupid questions and extra requests.
I part exed my car and the process was very easy to complete, I managed to arrange some good deals on extra insurances and warrenty for my aproved used BMW.
Simon kept in touch with me throughout the process and made it a super quick turn around even though I requested things be done to the car prior to my purchase.
On the day Simon made everything very simple and easy for me, everything was prepared and ready and the car was waiting out front for me. I couldn’t have had a better experience I don’t think just because it was just so easy!
Also the video they send to you when your car is in preparation is a nice touch - I loved that and it made me super excited to pick up my first ever BMW!"
2019-02-02,1,Took my car in for a fluid top up and despite waiting an hour nothing was done. Have chased for the online video and get no reply as nothing was done. They also charge owners of newer cars double the price someone with a car 4 years plus will pay and then say it’s BMW that sets the pricing. Emailed BMW who say it’s the local retailer who sets the pricing! Jenny Herbert of Inchcape never replies to any emails ! Waiting reply’s from the 17th Jan..
2019-02-01,5,"Excellent customer service as you would expect with Mercedes.
Patient and knowledgeable and handled all the details.
Good deal on my lovely new car."
2019-02-01,5,Excellent service from start to finish. I am delighted with my new car.
2019-02-01,5,Excellent service from start to finish from this dealership. Far better than two other Mercedes dealerships we’ve dealt with. Emile who we dealt with was brilliant. Would r3commend this garage to anyone buying a new or used Mercedes.
2019-02-01,5,Coopers of Malton give first class service for BMW cars in all areas-well worth checking out if you live in Yorkshire when looking to buy a BMW or have your BMW serviced
2019-02-01,4,"Good service (sales - haven’t experienced after sales yet)
Kept up to date with delivery times, just the right amount of detail in handover

The only negative thing I do have to say is they shut the door in a family members face (while I waited in the car) on a Sunday afternoon 20 minutes before closing so they wouldn’t have to stay late (only wanted a quick look around the showroom and pick up a brochure - 10 mins if that)"
2019-02-01,5,"Stephanie Rose from Mini in Chelmsford was attentive, friendly sand knowledgeable. She was so helpful and really looked into everything for me and the best deal for me. I couldn’t be more happy with the service or my car. I would 100% recommend and in 2 years i’ll be back for an upgrade and hopefully to see Stephanie once more. A friendly team in all.
Thank you."
2019-02-01,5,"Excellent service. Polite staff .
My BMW is working well. Thank you"
2019-02-01,5,"Salesman Steven Dixon good salesman and a pleasant young man,and sorted any queries out I had with the vehicle straight away 👍🏼😀"
2019-02-01,5,"Mercedes Nottingham - excellent service and excellent product. Jim in Sales is a true gentleman and did all he could to meet, if not exceed my expectations. Nothing has been too much trouble. Hope Jim is rewarded accordingly! 24 hrs after driving away with my new car, I still remain completely satisfied."
2019-02-01,3,"Service itself was faultless, but an unnecessary/dangerous oversight soured it at the end.

Drop off was easy and lift to Reading station first thing, clear communication throughout and easy collection at the end of the day.

It would have been 5-stars, except (luckily) I happened to go to check something on my dashcam before leaving the garage only to find they'd disconnected it from both the hard-wired power and the feed to the rear camera.

It's a professionally installed one tucked away behind the interior mirror so would have been very easy to overlook. I have no idea why they'd go to the effort of disconnecting it, but since they didn't mention it and it's not visible it's only pot luck I realised it had been disconnected (and was a real faff to reconnect).

Why unplug it at all?! And then if you unplug it, you should reconnect it. I could have been driving around for days without it running. Shame as it let down and otherwise very slick operation and now makes me wonder what they were doing with my car that warranted disconnecting the dashcam? And what else might they have forgotten to plug back in :/"
2019-02-01,5,Having taken my previous mini in for its MOT in November I had no idea I would be buying another one In the New Year. However I have always liked the new clubman (having owned its predecessor with the suicide door) and now I am the proud owner of a beautiful 18-plate clubman. Thank you mini Colchester making the process so hassle free.
2019-02-01,5,Just bought a new Yaris GRS.James Fagg was an excellent sales representative for the business although having a little problem know with my insurance due to it being a new model
2019-02-01,5,Excellent service. Niteesh was fab.
2019-02-01,5,Great and patient service. No pushy sales. Love the car
2019-02-01,5,"I was treated with courtesy from the minute I walked into the showroom.Plenty of coffee and biscuits.
Charlotte answered all my queries about the vehicle and was very knowledgeable about the marque.
The test run was conducted in a professional way and the negotiations went as expected.
On my return to pick up the car the handover was extremely smooth and I was impressed by the whole operation."
2019-02-01,4,"We bought our 520d m sport in December 2018. It’s a lovely car but I’ve had problems
With the car. I must say Suffyan is a true credit to Cooper Teesside from start to finish he has been superb and nothing has been to much trouble. Very professional and efficient and the faults on the car were rectified very promptly.

2019-02-01,5,"Thank you very much for good service.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Special thank you for

Thomas Byron"
2019-02-01,2,"Bought a used vehicle from the Southampton showroom. Salesman displayed a take it or leave it attitude and really did not show much interest. All negotiation was around financing options with no movement on sell price. Hard push to take car before end of month obviously for commission payments and not a lot coming back in return. In different circumstances, I would have chosen an alternative dealership."
2019-02-01,5,"Excellent service from the sales staff especially Thomas and James. Always on hand to answer emails/texts even when away from the office . Everything was explained precisely and advise in all areas of my purchase was very professional , their ethic of attention to detail and customer care is why I have rated them a 5 star.
A very well run , caring team that seems to make purchasing a new vehicle less stressful. Thank you"
2019-02-01,1,"Brought my A7 in as the break pad warning light came on the week before. Audi replaced the Rear Pads. I was given the car back and a few hours later noticed a 5 inch scratch on one of the wheels near the wheel bolts. Called Audi & they apologised & will repair the wheel.
THEN next day the break pad warning light came on. I called Audi & they told me to come in anytime for them to reset the light. Audi cleaned the pad sensors, tested the car and gave it back to me, 10 mins later the light came back on again. Called Audi, passed me through to the booking line & then they dropped the call. I called back, they said there was a technical issue so they'd call me back and 3 hours later no call.
I took the car to Audi to avoid these kind of issues & lack of professionalism."
2019-02-01,5,"Mercedes staff very friendly , they have done a excellent job."
2019-02-01,5,Excellent service from start to completion of purchase and collection of vehicle. No pressurised sales tactics. Full explanations of prices and extras.
2019-02-01,5,Excellent service in friendly atmosphere and was able to log in to my work by using the great wifi
2019-01-31,5,"I would recommend Mercedes Derby (pride park). Leon in service was very helpful, friendly & knowledgeable and kept me updated on progress of job throughout the day. My wipers packed up the day before and fortunately they managed to fix those at the same time! Mercedes are usually more expensive that non-dealer garages but on this occasion I felt it was worth paying for peace of mind on parts etc. Thank you :-)"
2019-01-31,2,"Exceptionally disappointed with my service at Cooper BMW Tadworth yesterday!
I had a courtesy car as my X3 was in from a recall and service.
The lady I dealt with took the mark of diesel in the courtesy car before giving me the car, she mentioned it was on a 1/4 tank, but never showed me the mark she made on her paperwork.
I drove 12 miles in the car (back home and later in the day back to collect my car). the lady I was dealing with agreed it was 12 miles.
But now the mark for the diesel was on reserve! I am not sure logically how 12 miles constitutes a 1/4 tank down to reserve, but without any common sense involved I was charged £7.56 for diesel.
I don't care about the money, but without even the manager coming out of his office, he determined that somehow doing 12 miles constituted such a drop in diesel.
12 miles constitutes £1.05 worth of diesel NOT £7.56.
I thought people working within the car world would be fully aware of this and use a little bit of common sense!"
2019-01-31,5,Fabulous service. George and Jack were both very helpful and attentive. Very happy with my new car would definitely recommend
2019-01-31,5,First class service from start to finish. Thank you Lauren.
2019-01-30,5,"My experiences at Inchcape in Derby have exceeded all expectations. Martin Harvey and Mr Henderson and the team made buying a car seem very simple, whilst being very informative and knowledgeable about GLC specifications, this illuminated their vast experience in the car industry. I was made to feel very comfortable which made the whole process very pleasurable, this coupled with the added surprise of a personalised number plate on my car on collection/ revealing day.
After having the car a few days I noticed a stiff / squeaky arm rest. Martin arranged for León Isaccs to assess the situation. León was very thorough and prompt at rectifying the situation. I was very impressed with the service and was asked if I would like my car washing whilst I was having a cup of tea!
It’s not just myself who was impressed, my husband was too, I think he maybe copying me in the future and follow my footsteps into the Mercedes Benz showroom...just as long as he remembers, I’m memory one in my car!
Thank you everyone involved at Inchcape Derby Mercedes Benz.
Kind regards,
Mrs J Henderson."
2019-01-30,5,Cannot fault the service from start to finish and apologies to the valeter who had to clean the filthy inside of my car!
2019-01-30,5,"Timely,to the point,curteous and efficient"
2019-01-30,4,Having had an awful visit to Stockport Audi followed by a great experience at BMW Stockport I very nearly didn’t consider buying an Audi. However my husband contacted Audi Macclesfield and from the first conversation all the way through to collecting the car we have been very impressed. Every member of staff was attentive and professional. The only reason I can’t give a 5 star rating is because just as I was about to take the keys to the new car I was introduced to the business manager who tried her hardest to hard sell a variety of insurance products. This was so disappointing! Thank you Matteo for making this a great customer experience.
2019-01-30,4,Very pleasant with no stress
2019-01-30,5,"Very happy with the level of service from Coopers, Chelmsford. Friendly and professional staff and a follow up call from the sales person was appreciated."
2019-01-30,5,I had an excellent experience with my purchase from mercedes benz cheshire oaks. The salesman could not do enough for us and made the process really clear and easy.
2019-01-30,5,I ordered a BMW Motorrad battery charger from Cooper Sunderland via eBay and was very impressed to receive the charger the next day. The charger was carefully wrapped and proved straightforward to use with clear charging information displayed. I would definitely not hesitate to use this company again in the future.
2019-01-30,5,Very informative staff. Kept me well informed. Very professional service.
2019-01-30,3,"Overall experience was not bad the report was great! but having said that on the report I got back, something did not make sense, as it said spare not and boot full of which i do have a spare and boot was not full unless i am misunderstanding it. Also vehicle on ramp. Is that not part of the inspection ? It just states all throughout not inspected with a couple of unable to inspect also included without reason as to why?"
2019-01-30,5,I received excellent service from Charlie and Gareth when I recently purchased an Audi TTS for Inchape Audi Macclesfield. The whole team are very professional and went out of their way to make sure the purchase was a positive experience. I would definitely recommend using Audi Macclesfield when buying a new or used Audi.
2019-01-30,5,"The team was very helpful and friendly, especially Rhys and Darren."
2019-01-30,5,Efficient and professional. Complimentary coffee and biscuits whilst waiting!
2019-01-30,5,It's always a pleasant experience walking into the York BMW branch. Greeted with a friendly smile the staff are always accommodating. The sales staff are helpful and look into all aspects of your requirements to tailor the correct model you're seeking. I shall be back in soon to look at some more models based on previous experience.
2019-01-30,5,"The parts were ordered online, dispatched ans received two days later. A very quick and efficient service at a good price ( cheaper by quite a margin than my local BMW dealership who are also part of the same group!?) Overal a good experience and I would recommend and definitely use again."
2019-01-30,3,"BMW Safety recalls: My 2nd recall went smoothly, apart from the wait to hand keys over, and on collection. My 1st recall left me with a car that pulled to the left as I left the garage as if suffering from a puncture or brake problem. The receptionist told me it unlikely to have been something that they had done and to return the next day!!!! After again waiting for quite some time, on investigation a software update had not been completed. On the positive side, I particularly appreciate the Health Check and the accompanying video."
2019-01-30,5,Kelsey was brilliant and the used mini we bought is fantastic
2019-01-30,5,Henry Barre was extremely professional and helpful in the way he dealt with us. The whole experience at MBL was extremely positive. Thank you.
2019-01-30,5,"Excellent service from the team, a bit of a wait in the morning but no hesitation booking again"
2019-01-30,5,"We never normally write reviews, but me and my partner had such a good experience at Landrover in Preston and the sales person Matthew Robertson. From start to finish he was amazing! We felt he took he’s time with us and went out of his way to make sure we got what we was looking for. It was an absolute pleasure and we are so in love with our new car. I would highly recommend this car dealership and especially Matthew, buying a car can become a very stressful time but thanks to you we had no doubts about the quality or buying the car. thank you so much we are very happy customers. Demmie & Caine"
2019-01-30,3,"MB tried their best but were a bit salesy. Once my new car was in, I called up to ask if I could collect it on sat/sun and the sales person said she unfortunately wasn’t working. I then called up on Sunday to check my number plate and she answered the phone! I assume they sell the most cars at the weekend and don’t want to be bothered by people collecting!

I then came to collect my new car and they had a grey car ready for me instead of the black one I had bought. They had put the same number plate on two cars!! The sales person sorted it all out within half an hour but this is a fundamental error."
2019-01-30,5,"Excellent service, no issues at all with the service dept, pity the sales dept wasn't as good when I tried to buy my car. In the end I had to go out of my town by 30 miles and buy it from another company as the salesman never got back to me more than once."
2019-01-30,5,Reliable .and plain speaking staff
2019-01-30,5,Quick and made to feel comfortable whilst waiting.
2019-01-30,1,Car was delivered over a week late with an additional 400 miles on the clock. Communication was very poor throughout the process. Overall customer service only improved once the General Manager had been communicated to and intervened. Would not go back.
2019-01-30,2,"Good Service whilst there, I was made aware of a few problems with my car. I have since rang BMW back 4 times and have left my details in order to speak to a member of staff regarding the matter, I have still not received a call back, this service is unacceptable for a main dealer, look elsewhere if you want any work completed on your vehicle."
2019-01-30,5,"My car was in for a service. The arrangements all went to plan, I had my car back at the time stated....and cleaned.The customer service was excellent whilst waiting for my car."
2019-01-30,5,I came in with a problem and was sorted without any fuss.
2019-01-29,5,"The whole experience from making first contact, to having my mini delivered has been fast friendly and efficient. No request was too difficult to accommodate and all extras I wanted were arranged without any issues. Sam was fantastic, it was well worth making the long trip from Scotland to purchase the car I wanted, I would definitely recommend Cooper Teesside MINI to others."
2019-01-29,5,"I'd recommend this branch to anyone, everyone there is helpful and very knowledgable.

Shout out to Adam who I give 10/10 to"
2019-01-29,5,Excellent service kept me updated throughout

2019-01-29,5,Very satisfied with the extremely helpful team at Cooper BMW in Norwich. My salesman James Albon could not have done any more to make this an experience to remember.
2019-01-29,5,"The whole experience has been great. The sales executive Rhys Candy was brilliant honest, no hard sell and very helpful"
2019-01-29,1,"It was not my fault my car had to be recalled but I was treated as if it was. No one had any time for me or was pleasant. As for the complimentary car wash, I could have done better with a bit of spit and my hanky."
2019-01-29,5,The services we received when purchasing out vehicle was outstanding. Julian explained everything to us and made the whole process very easy and stress free. Would recommend their services without a doubt.
2019-01-29,5,Excellent service and totally nothing to complain about. Will sorted all my questions out and sale of car went through no bother
2019-01-29,5,"Great experience at Inchcape Derby buying my new Evoque. It was made so by the ever attentive Mike Rawnsley and team. Great service guys, chuffed with my new car!"
2019-01-29,5,"Very friendly professional and welcoming.
Very pleased customer"
2019-01-29,2,"It was my first time of using Coopers for servicing since I moved to the Area and I must say that it was not one of my best experiences. Everything sort of happened but not in a way that left you feeling you had received good service. I shall try to be constructive in my feedback to assist you in focussing on the perceived issues.
Parking is a nightmare, cars are strewn everywhere, there appears to be no system of having dedicated parking bays for cars booked in for service. The poor old mechanics must spend ages wandering around the car park trying to find cars they’re supposed to be working on. Likewise once the work is finished the cars are then parked where there is a space which means the poor old customer is left wandering around in the dark looking for their car.
I was unable to stipulate a time for the car to be ready by. The Service Manager had apparently advised the receptionists that it was a busy day so they would need cars to the end of the day. It so happened I had a loan car but because of the distance I had to travel back to Coopers if I waited for a call at 5pm to advise me the car was ready I would probably have arrived after 6pm so I left to arrive at 5pm on the basis the workshop was closed therefore work will have been completed. The service had indeed been completed but the valet had not. I was asked if I would like to wait for 30-40 minutes for the car wash which I agreed to and spent my time looking for my next potential car. An hour and a quarter later the receptionist went and got the car for me. On arriving home I subsequently discovered the wheels on one side had been missed, the windscreen had been partially missed on the drivers side and the boot had not been vacuumed. I finished it myself the following morning. If you are going to offer a complimentary car clean then resource it in a way that can keep up with demand.
The loan car was fine apart from the cleanliness of the bodywork – it looked like it had been across a ploughed field. I know at this time of year cars will get mucky, particularly in a rural environment but I would have thought that Coopers would wish to promote their image by ensuring their cars were kept clean.
Feedback on the service, I got the paperwork and was told everything was ok but was never told the outcome of the BMW safety check on the rear axle (I forgot to ask), I assume it has been checked and any remedial works carried out."
2019-01-29,5,"Lovely personal service from Laura, product knowledge first class and felt amongst friends during the experience."
2019-01-29,5,"No problems with the staff.
Disapointed with BMW. Was concerned that my BMW required a replacement clutch after so few miles. I have been driving 50+years and previous cars have had more than double the mileage and never had clutch problems. When I checked on the internet it appears that the clutch of this model has lots of complaints.
I also question the cost of replacement. A local garage gave an estimate well below BMW.
Hoping I have not been foolish still using BMW."
2019-01-29,5,Excellent customer service one of the best I've received for a long time
2019-01-29,5,Excellent customer care

2019-01-29,4,Good staff with great sercive and highly recommend
2019-01-29,5,Friendly and efficient service. Let down slightly by a delay on collection due to receptionist forgetting to notify service agent of our arrival.
2019-01-29,4,"When I finally met the maintenance staff my problem was attended to swiftly. I didn’t need the loan car because the garage could sort the problem.
The problem is I called the service telephone number and they said the garage will need the car all day, I knew that it was only an hour job there is no movement with the booking system. I had to book the car in for the day and request a loan car."
2019-01-29,5,Good friendly staff not pushy . Lovely clean and welcoming showroom. Collected car and everything explained to me again.
2019-01-29,4,Seen within 15 minutes of my appointment time and car returned clean with no jobs outstanding.
2019-01-29,4,"Fast, efficient and attentive service with excellent communication throughout. Would recommend."
2019-01-29,2,"I was greeted by Louise in reception and she treated me as a person, explained what was going to happen to our car, showed me to our courtesy car and demonstrated how the car worked. Explained that our car would be ready by 16:00 which I was happy with as I had dropped our 4 series off at 8:05. I hadn’t heard anything all day so called bmw up at 15:00 to see how all was going. I was told that service wasn’t available and they would call me very shortly. I got a return call at 15:45 to say that our car would be ready at 16:30, 30 minutes later than agreed and bearing in mind I had dropped my car off at 8:05. We were on our way to pick our car up when we received a call to say when would we be there as we close at 17:00. My partner informed the lady that we were on our way. We had to put fuel in the courtesy car so did so on the way to coopers when we got another phone call to ask again where we were as we close at 17:00 and was told that “ if we didn’t get there by that time then we wouldn’t get our car back” well I’m sorry but I did leave my car by 8:45 and if we were 5 minutes late to pick are car up then we would have been penalised. I can’t believe that it takes nearly 9 hours to service and wash our car. Yes they may have other work to do but I was the first one at the garage and was the last one to pick up. We have to children also one 6 and the other is 9 months, so if we had of turned up at 16:00 or just before it would have been a nightmare. This is not the first time that we have been let down with timings by coopers and we are not that impressed to be honest"
2019-01-29,5,Excellent service and help in building your unique Mini.
2019-01-29,3,"My car was in for a while you wait service and I got a recall notice the week before. I expected the dealer to know that it needed a recall check but they didn't. I asked for the recall check to be done twice, to the meet and greet guy and then the receptionist. Unfortunately they didn't do it, so the car had to go back into the workshop while i waited. Shame as everything else was perfect, especially the facilities."
2019-01-29,5,Customer care is excellent
2019-01-29,5,Always polite and professional. Nitesh especially goes above and beyond and for him he makes it feel that nothing is too much trouble. Great service.
2019-01-28,5,"Great service, but it's expensive."
2019-01-28,5,"Great service , happy to recommend , Stuart and Dan were really helpful in Inchcape Southampton .
Thanks."
2019-01-28,5,"Dealt with Tony and he was brilliant, very friendly and approachable."
2019-01-28,5,"Great service in part exchange of my car, really looked after me and loved the red cape unveiling of the car. Great warranty, would highly recommended."
2019-01-28,5,"Thank you Martin Collins for helping me find my perfect car. The service provided was 5star at Inchcape Preston, Martin was very knowledgeable and helped me find the right car for me I would highly recommend people to try this garage as they have an fantastic range of cars to choose from 😁"
2019-01-28,5,"From the initial phone call registering my interest to driving away my new car, I can't recommend this garage enough - the relaxed but professional service was excellent,not like some obnoxious and pushy car dealerships. I had the pleasure of meeting Zak, who deal with the sale from start to finish. Very supportive and professional!"
2019-01-28,5,I had an excellent transaction from the very first viewing on the internet to the handover and collection of my vehicle. Everything was handled in a very professional manner.
2019-01-28,1,Booked a winter check on my X5 and turned up at the arranged time to discover I wasn't booked in. A total waster of time
2019-01-28,1,"Standards at Cooper Servicing Teesside seem to be slipping, if my experience is anything to go by.
I booked in my 3 series using Inchcape's central booking system and, as this was for a larger service, arranged for a courtesy car. I live about 25 miles from the dealership.
The day before I received a phone call, which included wondering why I did not go to a different BMW dealership around 50 miles away from where I live. I have been attending Teesside for more than 15 years. Providing the courtesy car was now difficult and the service could be done in under 2 hours anyway. I agreed to the change to be helpful.
I arrived at Teesside at 8.30am. and booked the car in. I was told it should take about an hour and a half and in any case no later than 10.30am. as my booking was in a red priority folder.
Once 11am had passed, I thought it worth asking about progress, as I looked like being late for other things I needed to attend to that day and found several customers awaiting attention with only a single adviser available as the others were in a meeting. Also, I was told that there is no service manager at the moment - perhaps this explains things.
It was after 11.30am before I was able to collect the car. Usually, I am provided with an engineer's report on the condition of the vehicle/service details but not on this occasion.

Overall, not up to the usual experience, Inchcape UK!"
2019-01-28,5,"Very good service, which included visual check of vehicle,
A bit suspicious beforehand with this,thinking they would be finding faults/ work needing doing.
Not the case at all pointed out issues that came up (advisory) on my very recent MOT.Gave very competitive quote on this.
Service reception staff really good but a special mention to "" Vern""? Who went the extra yard!
Definitely recommend and has for me thinking about using on regular basis.SB"
2019-01-28,5,"We visited CooperMiniReading on the 19th January after arranging with Edwin to test drive a used car. When we arrived we were immediately offered coffee. Edwin was very friendly, polite and told us everything we needed to know about the car. After the test drive we returned home to make a decision but phoned a couple of hours later to say that we would buy the car. There was no hard sell and I would strongly recommend Cooper Reading"
2019-01-28,2,"Rang to make appointment to test drive a car and gave plenty of info re current car for part exchange. Travelled over 100 miles to dealer and was kept waiting for over 35 minutes before we met the salesperson. No offer of a coffee or a nice welcome from reception.
Went on test drive that lasted about 5minutes , hardly enough time to get a feel for the car. When we started to discuss the part exchange I was asked all the questions again I had already provided answers for. The valuation was derisory and was then offered the opportunity to “play with the numbers”. Not impressed.
Having bought BMW’s from other dealers this was not the experience I was expecting."
2019-01-28,5,Just a lovely experience from ordering to pick up and we loved the “reveal” thank you Martin and Luke!
2019-01-28,5,"this was the first service for my VW Up

Excellent service booked in (Penny)at 8.30am straight forward no problems........... all finished and done by 9.30am.
Sat and waited for the service to be done comfortable clean hospitality area nice cup of coffee!
Staff asked if I was OK.
Very pleased to find email with visual record of the service being done

My Husband was very impressed !
we would recommend and will be in to look for a new Tiguan later in the year ."
2019-01-28,5,"Amy at the Shrewsbury Branch was really helpful, very polite and friendly and provided a great service."
2019-01-28,5,"Purchasing my car was a pleasing and pleasurable experience with this company. The salesman who looked after me was David Crowcombe and he was most helpful, a delightful man. I would recommend this dealership for your next Land Rover."
2019-01-28,5,"Cooper bmw Norwich made my visit for recall repairs straightforward,arranging for transport to Norwich city centre and return when my repairs were finished,nothing was too much trouble,the staff were curteous and my 11 year old bmw was even valeted.Would certainly recommend Cooper Norwich."
2019-01-28,5,Very good customer service and knowledgable staff
2019-01-28,4,Efficient service whilst I waited. Was hoping to have the car washed & vac'd but because it was a busy Saturday morning was told I would have to wait another hour or so....decided against it.
2019-01-28,4,"A manufacturer's recall to update airbag sensor

System to book appointments good
however when I originally booked the appointment some weeks ago I requested that they get in some replacement front wheel trims for my vehicle.
These were not available when I arrived for the airbag sensor check as apparently ""not that easy to get hold of""
I was told that when they arrived one of their mechanics who lived near to me would come and fit them at a mutually a range of all time.

Nice coffee and hot chocolate machine !"
2019-01-28,5,"Glen, the sales executive, was the perfect example of the face of Customer Service -professional, friendly & knowledgeable. He made the experience a memorable one and is a credit to Mercedes Coventry. I would certainly return and would recommend Mercedes Coventry to anyone considering a Mercedes."
2019-01-28,5,The workers were very professional
2019-01-28,5,"Great efficiency, professionals, very easy process...from beginning to end."
2019-01-28,1,"Wrote a review on 10/1/18 as requested. Because I had some issues, Inchcape responded on the same day, asking me to get in touch via the email address provided. I did this on 11/1/18, providing more information on my concerns. Heard absolutely nothing from them since, and now 17 days have passed.

From their response on Trustpilot, you may think they are concerned and want to address the matters I raised. The reality is different."
2019-01-27,5,"Really good experience where we were looked after by Gary. The car we had come to view was prepared and well presented.
We all agreed on a deal, very happy with communication throughout and took delivery of our beautiful SLK yesterday.
Gary was attentive throughout, and James the manager who oversaw the deal was really easy to deal with and both were genuinely interested in us as customers.
I had previously visited Mercedes franchises in the Midlands over the past 5 years and this is the only one where we were made to feel welcome.
We have now had really good experiences with inchcape in Derby in both their Mercedes Benz and Jaguar dealership

Highly recommend both Gary and James and Mercedes Benz Derby"
2019-01-27,4,"Aftersales / service department really good, friendly and helpful. Josh Suttcliffe was, in short, spot on. Car washed and hoovered. Loan car was much better than I expected. Overall, sales department, good effort, well done. Thanks"
2019-01-27,5,"I was impressed from the minute I walked into the Warrington show room, introduced straight away to Gavin, who was a nice warm chap and not pushy, nice atmosphere in the show room.. Would definitely go back and recommend them to other people.."
2019-01-27,5,Excellent service received from Dealership.
2019-01-27,5,Very friendly and helpfull! Highly recommended :)
2019-01-27,3,"Car booked in for safety check call back and minor service, along with maps update offer.

Recall safety check carried out and minor service completed, reassuringly expensive, though costs not detailed on booking appointment or taken through at time of payment. Maps update offer £25 was not undertaken because part not available. Garage said 1 to 10 days to get part, still waiting for phone call. I will follow up next week, which will mean I need to spend an half a day taking the car in and waiting for the update to be applied.

Live video of tyres and brake pads were sent through by email, but no information on fluid changes and resetting of service lights. No phone call from garage to say car was available to be picked up, especially surprising as safety recall may have meant car would have been held at garage for several days."
2019-01-26,3,"Firstly my experience via Gary my sales advisor was excellent. Very informative, professional and made for a very stress free purchase.
My 3 star review is solely based on an immediate fault driving the car away and a delay on collection due to a screw found in a tyre."

I WILL NOT HESITATE TO GO BACK AGAIN AND WAS VERY WELL LOOKED AFTER BY SYDNEY PYKE SALES EXECUTIVE"
2019-01-26,5,"Staff were very polite helpful, and had my car ready earlier than expected well don!!!"
2019-01-26,1,"I'm only giving Inchcape Audi Maidstone 1 star because I can't give them zero. My TT roadster (convertible) that I bought brand new for circa £30K on a 63 plate with only 7500 miles on the clock went haywire. Out of the blue just before Christmas I was in the garden when a motor came to life inside the car while it was parked up and locked. Subsequently the battery went dead. I recharged the battery but it refused to start, the engine would turn over but it just wouldn't start. The AA attended but they couldn't get it to start either. I have only ever used Audi for servicing and MOT and knowing that using an independent garage would de-value the car if I wanted to trade it in with Audi I had my car towed to the maidstone branch for the repair. The initial quote was £1300 with the cause of the problem being water had found its way inside the car to the fuel pump connections. A few days later that increased to £1700. Having very little choice I agreed to the repairs but stressed that I wasn't happy because water should not be getting inside the car, I can state 100% the roof was in perfect condition so it wasn't as if water was getting inside via a tear in the roof. On collecting my car I asked the after sales manager (Carl) to show me exactly how water got inside because obviously I had to make sure it didn't happen again. He explained that when the roof was down dirt was getting inside the gap between the roof and the bodywork, I estimate this gap to be about 10mm. The dirt was then blocking up the internal drain holes so subsequently water was building up inside the car which caused the damage. I asked him to explain how this was my fault as I didn't buy a convertible NOT to put the roof down and I couldn't maintain the drain holes as they were built inside the car and the only way of accessing them was to strip out the internal panels, in my opinion this is a manufactures design fault and Audi should pay for the repairs and carry out a retro fit to stop it happening again and they should then take this up with Audi directly. His response is priceless ""just because we have the Audi name above our doors it's not our problem"". How NOT to excel at customer service! Having taken advice I am now left in the position that I have to go through the various complaints motions and then the small claims court although that will be worth the £115 even if it only gets their costly solicitors into court to defend it. This is the 2nd TT I've bought from Inchcape but rest assured it is the last time I ever cross their threshold!"
2019-01-26,5,"Very good service, highly recommended"
2019-01-25,5,Very well organised; good communication; a very professional service
2019-01-25,5,"Just bought my car from the Inchscape in Burton upon Trent and the whole experience from start to finish was amazing.

I requested details about a car I'd found online and was sent a personalised video tour the next morning. They looked after us, taking us on a good test drive and answering the many questions my boyfriend had about cars in general!

They couldn't have have made it simpler and easier to buy a car :)"
2019-01-25,4,"Car was in for a recall. The service and speed was very good. The only downside was waiting time - it was a freezing cold day, we were walking back from the garage and my elderly mother was waiting outside with the dog while I handed the keys in - however I was asked to sit and small talk with staff, which just seemed aimed at getting my email address for promotion purposes. Similarly when picking the car up my mother was outside in the dark, while waiting at the desk nobody came out to see me for several minutes, despite lots of tooing and froing. Drop off and pick up could be improved as people have busy lives and other priorities."
2019-01-25,5,"Excellent customer service, very happy."
2019-01-25,5,First time visit to Audi Macclesfield for my Audi A6 first vehicle check and oil change. I have to say the video sent to my email address from the technician working on my car is a fantastic idea. First class service to be honest from booking the car in at 07.30 am to the guy who dropped it off at my home.
2019-01-25,5,"Great service all round
From reporting the problem with my car
The service from the girls on the front desk and the lads who dealt with the problem with my car all 5star"

2019-01-25,5,Excellent for timing and the service
2019-01-25,5,Amazing service. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.
2019-01-25,5,Easy to find location. Staff phoned day before to make sure that I would still be attending. On arriving staff were helpful - service took the time that was stated - and health check and valet was completed within the time allocated. Staff were very helpful and ensured that everything was done satisfactorily.
2019-01-25,5,Excellent customer service
2019-01-25,5,Excellent service experience of purchasing a car from start to finish
2019-01-25,1,"Disgraceful service. Thames Cooper BMW are absolutely useless. Couldn't get the address right and couldn't call me to give me updates. When I chased for updates, I was given the wrong information including ""we will drop your car off in 20mins"" at 5.30pm followed by a call half an hour later saying ""it will be with you tomorrow morning, and you will get a call"". Aside from leaving me sitting in my office waiting like a plum for a car they had no intention of delivering back to me, I also didn't get the promised call and had to chase at midday to be met with complete confusion and no-one having a clue what was happening with my car. And the kicker is, despite me correcting them three times they sent this ""review us now"" email to me as well as my receipt with the wrong name and wrong address on it - how fitting. I seriously believe that not one staff member in the service department knows what they are doing, and I wouldn't even trust that they know what a car is. Probably the worst service I have ever had from anyone to do with anything. Avoid at all costs! You'd be better off hitting your car with a hammer - at least then you'd know what to expect."
2019-01-25,5,"Brilliant service at Cooper BMW in Tunbridge Wells. Excellent facilities and polite, cheerful and helpful staff especially Stephanie."
2019-01-25,5,Great customer service and better than any BMW dealer I had visited up in Scotland listened to my needs and got me the right car at a great price
2019-01-25,1,"Cooper BMW Teesside & Durham

Both dealerships not interested in new customers, been trying to arrange a test drive of the X2 this week, called both dealerships and spoke with their sales teams to arrange a test drive... promises from both dealerships to call or email back with an appointment... no response!! I suspect that as we are looking to order through the NHS lease scheme they are not interested... one call to Lloyd BMW Newcastle and the test drive is arranged in an instant... something to aim for Cooper BMW."
2019-01-25,5,"Grate experience at Coopers in Tunbridge Wells. Since the moment we step in till the moment we leave with our “new” car was absolutely straight forward and amazing service to met our needs. Ram was outstanding. We feel valued as a customer.
Well done to all in there."

2019-01-24,5,"Very good customer relations. Chris Welch had good people skills. He kept me informed by video about the health check and the MOT/Brake fluid change was done speedily and efficiently. As someone who is new to these things I was reassured.
Please note that any future contact should be to me Mrs. A. Cross
Many thanks"

Many Thanks for the wonderful service"
2019-01-24,4,"Took car for service which was all done fantastic, only reason I gave 4 stars is during the waiting period no one came to me to give updates. I noticed my car washed and ready but after 10 minutes waiting went and asked one member of staff my car seems ready but nobody has approached me. I had to ask for my keys."
2019-01-24,5,"Nathan Franklin was a pleasure to deal with. He was helpful, honest, polite and kept me in the loop at every step. I love my new car and would recommend Nath and everyone at Audi. Thankyou!"
2019-01-24,5,Exceptional service every time . That’s why I come back year after year after year . Your doing a great job and I cannot rate this dealership highly enough ❤️
2019-01-24,5,"Like walking into a five star hotel rather than a service department (am I in the right place?). Trying to create an upmarket lifestyle ambience and ownership experience and quite successfully. Probably complete overkill but the coffee and biscuits were nice, as were the very friendly and helpful staff"
2019-01-24,5,"Excellent service offered by all staff, no high pressure sales and very informative, which made the purchasing experience a delight and stress free. The staff clearly explained the whole process and updated us on a regular basis. It was a pleasure doing business."
2019-01-24,5,First experience of Inchcape in Basingstoke. Found the staff to be very helpful and polite and very attentive. Work was completed to expectations and the service dept provided a video review of the car and highlighted areas for concern and the repair costs. No pressure applied to have the work done though. From my own experience I would use them again.
2019-01-24,5,Brilliant customer service. This company really go the extra mile to make sure their customer is happy!
2019-01-24,5,"My service advisor, Bryony was more that helpful and went above and beyond when accommodating me with dropping off and collecting my car. All members of the team at VW Inchcape, Shrewsbury were all friendly and helpful and I would recommend them to anyone needed VW specialists in the future."
2019-01-24,5,"The work involved with the BMW factory recall to check or replace the EGR cooler on my F10 530D was carried out efficiently. At my request the car was collected from my home and returned at the advised times, and the vehicle had been comprehensively checked and valetted. The experience was very satisfactory indeed and I have no hesitation in recommending Cooper Malton."
2019-01-24,5,"Great customer centric experience - dropped the car for a service, coffee and a few hours work done in their lounge. Job done!"
2019-01-24,2,I took my Mini to Coopers yesterday to have a service and to investigate a rattle in the arm rest. After dropping my car off at 9am I didn’t get my car back until 8pm. They insisted that the rattle was fixed and was retested to check it had gone. I then drove in and the rattle was still there. I have found the service department very unwilling to help and rectify their own mistake.
2019-01-24,5,The whole experience of selecting and buying my new car was handled in a professional way. The dealership was friendly and made the transaction stress free.
2019-01-24,5,"Very professional and polite, even car was washed foc 👍👍"
2019-01-24,4,Good experience

Excellent service, staff very helpful and friendly. Feel my car is in very good hands."
2019-01-24,5,"Can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish ran smoothly, walked in knew roughly what I wanted, Jamie the salesman was fantastic. He kept me up dated along the way, with courtesy calls. Love my new car and will certainly be returning to Teesside cooper again. Fab customer service, would certainly recommend."
2019-01-24,5,"Service was carried out promptly, and when I authorised extra work to be carried out I was called to discuss this in detail and to talk about how necessary or not the items were."
2019-01-24,5,"Great customer service from booking my car in for a service to leaving. Excellent waiting area, WiFi allowing me to work and excellent video"
2019-01-23,1,"Well we have a car.. through must though not desire, every step of the way we ran into problems - the website advertises cars that are not actually available to view yet and still advertises cars that have been purchased - pretty annoying! After selecting a couple to view we made our decision however this was mainly down to our own due diligence not so much the sales representative - he promised to tailor our finance options to suit us but failed to listen to what we actually wanted, having said that he didn't do such a bad job he was pleasant with us through out this process however the real clincher was charging us the deposit twice!!! Although he did apologise the employee of VW West London we spoke to over the phone was less than pleasant and actually made us contemplate going ahead with this deal, serious lack of customer service and appalling considering the amount of money - we're not talking about a toy car! As I am typing this I still have not received my refund which was only processed on the day we collected the car - 3 days after the double charging happened. On the plus we are happy with the car although on closer inspection the cleanliness was not up to scratch, visible substance was found in the USB section which we had to clean ourselves. This was not the best introduction to car financing and we will seriously be considering returning in 3 years to stay with VW.
Lets hope the car provides a better experience than the sale."
2019-01-23,1,If I could have put 0 stars I would ! Hunters sold me a Range Rover with a faulty clutch ! Took a month to repair ... smashed the windscreen whilst it was in for repair! Then returned it to me with no petrol/ def/coolant and all the warning lights on! Zero customer service ! Absolutely appalling! Definitely do not use hunters Chester! They have no idea what they are doing! And once they have your money they are not in the slightest bit interested !
2019-01-23,5,"Excellent reception on arrival, the Gentleman greeted me by name and I was shown to a waiting area with fresh coffee- what a start! Service was superb, a video of my car and an excellent experience when picking up too! Great"

2019-01-23,5,"Very helpful and fantastic service, would definitely recommend"
2019-01-23,5,"I recently purchased a Mini Cooper S from Cooper Sunderland. My father had the initial communication with Will. He was informative and excellent to deal with. He delivered on the promises he made throughout the process and was willing to give a price for trading in my Mini Cooper by seeing the photos. As I am from Edinburgh and neither Will or I had seen the cars this was extremely appreciated.

When visiting Cooper Sunderland on Saturday 19th January both my father and I were made to feel welcome and Will indulged my father's love of cars by talking through different models.

The process on Saturday was extremely easy and Will made it painless with all the form signing.

I would like to thank Will for making this purchase an easy one and being able to provide a car that met my criteria. Since taking the car away I have loved every moment of driving it and I look forward to continuing to do so. I would definitely recommend Will and Cooper Sunderland and when I look for a new mini in the future I will make sure to call upon you.

2019-01-23,4,Excellent service from staff who arranged an urgent repair of my car when it would not start. My thanks to Jim in particular for fitting me in. Diagnostic a bit pricey but overall no complaints due to swift service and great staff.
2019-01-23,2,"I could not get booked into my local BMW garage in a timely manner to get my rear break pads replaced. My car is a lease car and the leasing company booked me into Coopers Croydon as they had the earliest booking date. I have never been there before and I won’t be returning! The evening before I got a voice message telling me I would not have a courtesy car! Even though this had been booked prior. I was most annoyed as the garage is 15 miles on an indirect route by public transport from where I live! I am so used to being met by friendly personnel outside Stephen James BMW Ruxley when I arrive with my car in the past so I expected the same! Not only did the gentleman walk straight past my car despite me looking lost, when he did speak to me and show me where to go he was not friendly! The gentleman at the desk who booked me in was much the same! To return home after leaving my vehicle I had to take a bus, train, rail and then another bus to get back home! To cut a long story short I was then told to pick up my car by 5.45pm. I got there at 5.50 and my car was not bought out until 6.20pm! Never again! Oh plus the brakes do not feel as sharp as before at all!"
2019-01-23,5,"Just purchased a second hand car from inchcape Norwich. Considering it wasn’t a new car I was given 100% customer service. I would like to commend Keith Richardson for all his help. We had a lot of light hearted chats whilst getting down to the seriousness of a purchase. He was amazing, thanks Keith ."
2019-01-23,5,Excellent customer service
2019-01-23,5,"Inchcape Toyota Repair shop at Burton on Trent have been brilliant. In particular I need to commend Mr. Nigel Winebloom (repair estimator and mechanic) and receptionist Ms. Kay. They have made such a traumatic experience of having to get repaired almost brand new car, after an accident, so pain free and brilliant.
Estimates are spot on and time taken for repair is very reasonable. Thank you for doing such a wonderful job. Keep up the good work. !!"
2019-01-23,5,Lovely customer service
2019-01-23,5,Happy and helpful staff. Work completed quickly and effectively.
2019-01-23,5,"In November 2018, I had come to Mercedes with high expectations on the level of service I would receive. However, being dealt with in a poor manner by a sales representative and having poor overall customer service and experience I had lost faith in the brand. Nevertheless, having my heart set out on a Mercedes car from the beginning, I revisited the Coventry branch in hope for a better experience. I was served by a colleague name Zee Pfuma, who over-writ my previous experience. He was not just extremely welcoming and a happy character, the non-pushy sales technique and genuineness that came across during all interactions which actually led me to purchase my first ever mercedes-benz vehicle. The non-stop great service he has provided from the start still continues, with multiple visits to the branch I have left each time knowing my issues/vehicle is in the best possible hands. Ultimately, I believe this gentleman is a huge investment Mercedes have made for the Mercedes-Benz branch in Coventry and I hope his hard work and efforts are all noted and praised."
2019-01-23,5,"Easily the best garage I’ve bought a car from. Very friendly staff from reception to the sales team, smooth purchase and stress free. Nothing was to much bother for them to assist. My new used car is immaculate and I love it. Thank you so much particularly to Dan in sales for welcoming me to the BMW family in style. Would highly recommend and use again. 😊"
2019-01-23,5,Overall excellent service
2019-01-23,5,"Excellent service from Lexus Guildford as always.
Very helpful and friendly staff."
2019-01-23,5,"We had travelled over 200 miles, we were made very welcome - the whole process of purchasing the vehicle was great.
From negotiating the sales price to hand over of keys we would definitely purchase from them again."
2019-01-23,4,Great service felt like they appreciated my custom and exceeded expectations
2019-01-23,1,"Cooper Croydon were shambolic. Had to face a bunch of grumpy grouchy people who had no interest in serving customers. There was no system to attend to people . Many of us who were waiting were still sitting there while new people who came were being attended to. when asked why, they were clearly ignoring us.
we were told that the entire service would take 1.5 hrs starting at 945. it was 130 when we finally left the place. There was also no parking available to park the car . if this is how it works then why bother to book an appointment . It was a free for all. When we asked to talk to the Mnager to complan , I was told that all of them were busy and no one came out to take a complaint.

Extremely frustarted and disappointed with BMW service."
2019-01-23,4,Good service
2019-01-23,5,Recieved a video of the underside of the car with breakpad and tyrewear marked up on it which was a nice touch ! The car was ready for when I wanted it returned and free coffee to boot!
2019-01-23,5,I was at audi macclesfield for interim service on my car. And experience of my visit is always pleasant as usual. Esther gave me a lift as well to my work until the car is serviced and ready. Best as always. No fault. Thank you audi macclesfield.
2019-01-23,1,"Usual car dealership experience. All over you with good service right up to the point you hand over the cash and then they are not interested. Been waiting over a week for a callback from the salesman in relation to booking the car in for repair. Waiting over a week for a reply in relation to a refund on the Gap Insurance they told me was free but after reviewing the docs I was charged £295 and I noticed they manipulated the figures of car price to fit in the cost of the Gap Insurance!!

Glad to see you take mis-selling so seriously!

Hi Mr Leon Woosnam, we regret to hear that you are displeased with your recent experience with us. Thank you again for taking the time to let us know how we can improve. We hope you will consider us again in the future. Take care."
2019-01-23,5,"Very friendly, helpful and provide an excellent personal service. Atmosphere whilst waiting is welcoming and drinks available to keep one going.

They managed to sort out my paperwork in double- quick time, ready for a lengthy journey - highly recommended!"
2019-01-23,4,good service parking at dealers very tight
2019-01-23,5,Friendly and helpful service
2019-01-22,5,"Professional, courteous and customer focused. Will
Return"
2019-01-22,5,"i had the first service on my CLA. I arrived at the st georges showroom around 9am and was pleasantly greeted good morning by every employee i saw from the car park to the reception. the gentleman i met was nice and courteous throughout. i asked for a replacement car and was happy to see i got a white C Class convertible. shame it was cold and windy, car was lovely.

i returned the car on time, my car was valeted and no problems to report, i received a email with a link to a video and full report about my service. very nice, i can see the report on my Mercedes me app too.

this experience made me feel like a valued customer, very different to the experience i had when buying the car. the salesman was dull, blunt, and failed to demonstrate any courtesy from the time i ordered to the time i collected, same person.

if i didnt like my Mercedes i would have never bought from that person. however, this recent experience has helped to leave that bad experience behind.

i was asked to complete a satisfaction survey at time of collection. (when i bought the car) you will NEVER get the real feedback by making your customers do that in front of the person they are unhappy with, you should send a survey link by email or post."
2019-01-22,5,Excellent service and a great deal. All managed very efficiently
2019-01-22,4,The transaction associated with the purchase of a mini was seamlessly and professionally handled by the staff at Coopers of Reading.
2019-01-22,5,Very professional & helpful
2019-01-22,5,Excellent service as always.
2019-01-22,5,First class service from Sophie Edmunds. Actually listened to our requirements and asked sensible questions before recommending what matched our criteria. Very happy to recommend the Mini Centre in Ipswich - all the staff we spoke to were excellent.
2019-01-22,5,"VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE.
VERY EFFICIENT AND WELCOMING STAFF."
2019-01-22,5,First class service. Nothing was too much trouble for the salesman who was the best I have ever dealt with in all my years purchasing cars from Mercedes.
2019-01-22,5,"The team were approachable, polite, helpful and communicating constantly when any changes occurred"
2019-01-22,5,The best service I've ever had in my life.
2019-01-22,5,"Excellent showroom with friendly, efficient, knowledgable staff."
2019-01-22,2,"I contacted Cooper, Croydon (BMW Main Dealer) to arrange for them to supply and fit four winter tyres to my 65 reg 320d (F30). Unfortunately, Cooper were not able to supply winter tyres to fit the OEM rims. This forced me to source BMW approved winter tyres myself - which I did. Having booked the car in, Cooper charged me £165 to fit the four tyres. I was warned there would be a charge, but not warned it would be this high when I made the appointment. Cooper took two hours to fit the tyres for what was supposed to be a while-you-wait service. Overall, a little disappointed with the experiene. I don’t think anyone could reasonably describe this as a premier service. BMW Cooper Job reference was: 43137"
2019-01-22,5,Great service. Darren was great and answered any questions I had. Nothing was too much bother.
2019-01-22,5,Seen to promptly and vehicle serviced on time. Gary was very courteous and helpful
2019-01-22,5,Great customer service. Carl couldn't have been more helpful. The car was spotlessly clean on pick up. Highly recommended.
2019-01-22,5,We found all staff to be accommodating & extremely helpful with our purchase. Many thanks are extended to Jon & Mark who were very helpful in ensuring a smooth purchase. It is also worth mentioning the delightful young lady on reception on Sunday 13th & Sunday 20th January who was exceptionally pleasant. We have no reservations in recommending this company in the future. With Many Thanks Andrea
2019-01-22,2,"I booked my car in for its first service a few weeks in advance. I arranged for the car to be collected and returned to my home. I was told it would be collected between 8am-11am and returned between 3 and 6pm. I called at 11 when no-one had arrived, told it would be up to 12 o’clock. I called at 1.30 as still no show. Eventually the car was collected at 3pm. When I booked the car in I mentioned an issue with tyre pressure, I also mentioned this when I rang up to chase but still the man collecting seemed to have no note of this so wrote it on his paperwork.
The car was returned at about 5 pm-taking out travel time this service was obviously done very quickly. I was disappointed that the car had not even been washed, which has always been done on my Mercedes from other dealerships. The paperwork was returned with an inspection sheet showing a couple of scratches. I was not involved in this and think I should have agreed these scratches before car taken rather than when it’s returned. I have no idea weather or not they were already there.

So, all in all a very disappointing experience and a whole day waiting in."
2019-01-22,4,Good experience and very helpful with some additional questions I had about the new car. Would have had 5 stars but the courtesy car only had 5 miles left in the tank when they gave it to me so I had to detour to fill up straight away.
2019-01-22,5,Brilliant team at Mercedes Southport especially Alan and the receptionist who were both very friendly and went out of their way to help us. Highly recommended and we will be a returning customer.
2019-01-22,5,Excellent service 👍🏻
2019-01-22,3,"Staff were friendly, although i was stood infront of 5 members of staff for 5-10 mins before it was even acknowledged i had walked in.
The branch has building works going on and sitting in the waiting area uostairs was unbarable due to the building works noise.
Was also a little disappointed at tyres being recomended for replacement when tread depth was recorded and shown via the video link as being 4.9mm? However on all paperwork they have written 4mm followed by a Bit of a cheeky attempt at getting £216 for tyres that arent really needed and shouldnt really have been an advisory....overall staff were freindly however i do not think i will be returning as the experiance left a bit of a bad taste to be honest."
2019-01-22,1,"Had to wait when dropped car off for 30 mins to be seen then told car was ready and when I got there another 40 min wait. Car hadn’t been washed and was dirtier than when I taken in. Only one staff member, apologetic but sorry not good enough ."
2019-01-22,5,"Well run, efficient and lovely people to do business with."
2019-01-22,2,"Nobody was rude to me, the only friction was on my part but, I went all the way to Mercedes Cheshire Oaks only find that my appointment had been deleted! I was not best pleased. The time and the costs also comes into it. The staff were very nice and helpful. They will be calling me back for another appointment after they find out why it was deleted."
2019-01-22,3,"Lovely people and can’t do enough for you but.... when they say you can sit and wait for tyres to be done it will only take an hour - not realistic! Sat for 2 and a half hours missed meeting at work, received calls from work, had to pester for my car. If said need half a day would have been better and would have called back for it and worked from home. Lesson learned."
2019-01-21,2,"The service area was very busy and there were limited places to park on Friday when I dropped the car off for its major oil service.

At the time of booking the oil service, I was told that the service would take 4 hours, however when I dropped the car off for its service I was told the car would not be ready for up to 8 hours. It was actually completed in 6 hours.

At the time of booking the oil service, I was told the car would be washed and valeted. Unfortunately the car was NOT washed and NOT valeted when I picked the car up. I asked about this and the service person just ran off with my car key ... see below.

When I picked the car up after the oil service there was nowhere to park the car and the service person handed the car over to me with its engine running and ran off without giving me the key. This was quickly returned when I chased after him. .

The oil service cost £543, at this level of cost I did expect the car to be washed and valeted and to be treated as if I was a valued customer, instead of which I was left feeling that the staff could not wait to get rid of me and my car.

Very disappointing experience."
2019-01-21,5,Outstanding
2019-01-21,5,"Excellent experience, I will continue to use Audi Tetbury for their great customer service."
2019-01-21,5,Fantastic experience first class
2019-01-21,3,"Car couldn't be serviced first time I booked in on 5th January, I was dealt with professional by the staff but I wasn't notified until I turned up that morning that it couldn't be done due to the lease company not having cleared an outstanding payment.

I had to call to rebook in, I wasn't notified of when the payment had been made and the service could take place.

Car was serviced on the 19th, service was fine, however the car as not clean when I collected after having been told twice it was part of the service that it would be full washed and cleaned inside and out. Even when I collected I was told it had been done when it hadn't. It was disappointing as everyone I know with audi's always praises the servicing and after car."
2019-01-21,4,"Service while you wait, work carried out in good time, Advised of cost beforehand, friendly staff."
2019-01-21,5,Excellent service at every level. Particularly liked the text with video health check that highlighted important information regarding annual service.
2019-01-21,5,Excellent service. All the promised times were kept. Great informative reception staff.
2019-01-21,5,Very good service!
2019-01-21,4,"Bought a used Audi and would have given an excellent score, but unfortunately they did not deal with a few very small bodywork issues despite advising me that the car was in the garage being sorted!
Whilst Audi have now arranged for a local Company to complete the repairs, it would have been a better experience for Audi to be honest and delay the handover of the vehicle."
2019-01-21,3,"Inchcape Soton have recently moved but I was not notified and the service booking staff failed to check if I knew they had moved when booking the car in. Furthermore the website still has many references to the old address and no 'banners' about the fact they have moved - you would think this would be a 'great story'
I specifically asked when I arrived with the car for the car not to be valeted as I was in a rush - this was not acted upon so was delayed in consequence. Hopefully the work done was up to standard"
2019-01-21,5,"Excellent service, I was well informed and everything was completed at the said time."
2019-01-21,5,Took my mini to this dealership for a check and MOT. Staff polite and efficient so would happily recommend them.
2019-01-21,4,"Salesman Edward was excellent 10/10
Overall let down a little bit by over pushy managers trying to sell add-on insurance policies"
2019-01-21,5,"Excellent service. Loved the video they sent me and finished in time for an appointment I had that day.
The service receptionist was so helpful, fab coffee also"
2019-01-21,3,"Cooper Thames Ditton better than it has been, but still room for improvement.
Car in for a service. Knowing how busy this dealership always appears to be, I tried to alleviate some of the pressure on everyone by telling them I didn't need my car back the same day - I would collect tomorrow morning. I arrived around 11:30am and was informed 'it just being washed'.
'Just' was the operative word here!, the car finally appeared about 30 minutes later. Fortunately, I didn't need to be anywhere specific - but I would have thought the 'wash' could have been the first job of the day, especially as I hadn't requested the vehicle be ready for collection at COB the previous day."
2019-01-21,3,"Contacted Hyde Audi because they had the vehicle I wanted at about the right price. Arranged a test drive and then arranged to purchase the vehicle. Expected some movement in the price but there was none!! I had a rare sought after trade in but got about average price for it.

To close the deal I asked if there was anything further Hyde Audi could do. All i got was an attempt to sell me a finance package which i didn't want or need and was dressed up to look as if it was giving me a good deal. It wasn't.

When i test drove the car the light was bad but i was advised by the sales guy Gary Oakes that the car was great and in excellent condition and there would be nothing to worry about.

The car is great and in excellent condition but the front tyres are only just ok at 3.4mm tread - that is the information which was on the 149 Multi Point Audi check which wasnt pointed out to me at the point of sale, the tyres I mean, not the 149 point check.

Gary did a great job for Audi but nothing for me. I paid the asking price and agreed to the Gardx finish.

Fords of Winsford had the same car albeit with a higher mileage but almost £3000 cheaper and they would have given me £500 more for my trade in!! Unfortunately another customer beat me to it or I would have bought from them.

In a nutshell the car sold itself. If Gary had said , ' look the front tyres are not great so I will put a couple of new tyres on the front ' I would have walked away happy. Instead I have got a great car but I next time I will go somewhere else. Yes maybe I am a bit naive but I have bought plenty of cars in the past and always been happy with the deal. Not this time."
2019-01-21,5,"Good experience dealing with Crawley Audi for my car service.
Few hiccups with another Audi garage as I brought the car originally from another dealership and they forgot to add my free service onto the system, but Jemma at Crawley was a fantastic help and resolved the issue very quickly and efficiently.
Thanks again!"
2019-01-21,5,Excellent service
2019-01-21,5,"Matt was just brilliant from the off, got back in touch with me within the day and o just felt reassured throughout the whole process of buying my car! Didn’t feel pressured and even when I got there there was no pressure just felt very relaxed and all the paperwork was effortless, top guy and top company can’t fault them"
2019-01-21,5,"First service with my first VW, impressed, car picked up and delivered, returned clean and with the video of the service/inspection. All the staff from the Colchester Branch were brilliant, polite and pleasant to deal with. Top marks for customer service :)"
2019-01-21,3,"To be honest, pretty disappointing, I expect much more from BMW. My car was booked in for a loose door hinge, routine task which was completed. I was offered the usual wash and valet which was not completed. Graeme very apologetic but at the end of the day this is BMW."
2019-01-21,4,"Fast and efficient service plus a comfortable waiting area. The staff were very courteous in spite of being very busy.

Only docked a star as the online system allowed me to book when the garage was not open meaning it had to be rearranged at short notice."
2019-01-21,5,"Excellent service, friendly and helpful staff. Made buying my car an absolute pleasure. Even have decent coffee too"
2019-01-21,5,"Great friendly service from Mark in the Service team when I had to take my car in for a recall appointment. Stayed and worked there for 3 hours. Great facilities, although some chairs more suitable for office working would have been appreciated."
2019-01-21,1,"90 min express service took 2 hours 10 mins. Had to leave before having the wipers changed or the car cleaned, as they made us late to pick up the children from school. Went back on Saturday to have wipers changed and that took 2 hours and they still did not wash the car. Find another dealer to get your car serviced as the Cooper Thames Ditton experience has convinced me to buy a Mercedes."
2019-01-20,5,Excellent customer service from Inchcape Volkswagen Cheltenham. Very polite reception staff and extremely pleasant service advisor (Daniella) kept me fully informed regarding the process and outcome of my vehicle health check. I received verbal and video report from technician whilst my car received a complementary wash and vac plus advice regarding future maintenance all free of charge
2019-01-20,5,Took delivery of a new car from Inchcape York this week. Kevin Watson was very efficient and knowledgeable and sourced the new car very quickly for us. Would highly recommend.
2019-01-20,5,Car picked up and returned promptly cleaned and serviced. Video of vehicle check very helpful
2019-01-20,5,"My 2004 Avensis was recalled re airbag problem. Not only was it done in record time (2 visits put into 1) but it was also washed, valeted and checked over. We combined a shopping trip with this appointment and they kindly ferried us into town and offered to bring us back. Hot drinks were offered whilst waiting for our lift and when we got back from shopping. Full marks all round!"
2019-01-19,5,"From the moment I first walked into Bmw Teesside I was totally put at ease, I was introduced to Kate who was fantastic with me, she went above & beyond to find the perfect car for myself, I love my new car, thanks cooper Bmw"
2019-01-19,5,Very helpful and knowledgable staff that are a credit to the Mini organisation and dedicated to the task of supporting people in purchasing thier dream car(s).
2019-01-19,5,"Brand new site. Drive-in to undercover drop-off so no problems parking or having to walk to the service reception in the rain. Service carried out as expected, car cleaned and valeted. A pleasant experience all round. Booked too late for a loan car but was given a lift to and from Southampton city centre."
2019-01-19,3,"I got the car I wanted at a brilliant deal, but was often kept waiting for long periods of time and also when the car came the finishing touches could have been better. The polish wasn’t rubbed in properly etc which made the car look like it had scuffs at first. Also when coming to collect the car we got messed around a bit and then we were kept waiting for a long time even though they knew we had somewhere to be. I am happy with the deal on the car but it could have been more smooth sailing"
2019-01-19,5,"Very happy with my overall experience dealing with Inchcape Jaguar Southampton. All Jaguar employees were very helpful and attentive from first visit through to final day of collection.

Thank you"
2019-01-18,1,"Never take your car here for service or repair! Let alone buy a new car from the Mercedes Leicester branch. The staff are rude and especially the so-called branch manager who could not care less for customer service! Told me to complain to Ombudsmen, if do not like his decision! Such disgusting behavior! Never apologized or cared less about helping me sort this problem out.
I brought my car in here for major repairs and nearly three months later, still not fixed properly! Since then, I have had nothing but problems with the car. Still have faulty front brakes, noisy fan belt, oil warning light come on and squeaky suspension and many more. In the last visit, I told the receptionist I will be picking up the car later in the day, when I came in my lunch break to pick up the car; the car had a flat battery! I was fuming and could not believe the service I am receiving after I have spent over £3,000 with Mercedes. The mechanics did not care or apologize for this error on their part. Is this the service, I should expect from Mercedes, Leicester? How many times do I need to bring this car in for repair for the same faults? I feel the money I paid is too much for the shabby repairs and I have had no benefit from the work done. Because they cannot get any more money from me, they told me the timing chain needs replacing!! Total rubbish! Got someone to look at this, and said to me, does not need replacing. What a Joke! Cannot believe Mercedes of Leicester were trying to rip me off for over £3,000 of work which does need to be done! Beware of this place you have been warned!"
2019-01-18,5,Great service
2019-01-18,3,No point offering a free clean when you leave the windows dirtier than when the car was dropped off and why did the technician change my music over?
2019-01-18,5,"Aadam Sadiq at Cooper Mini was incredibly helpful and made the whole process of part exchanging our old car and buying a new car so easy. He took time to explain all the options to us, kept in contact with us while the car was being built and explained how everything worked when we took delivery of the car. We highly recommend Aadam and Cooper Mini in Surbiton."
2019-01-18,5,"Smooth visit, work completed within stated time and a comfortable lounge to wait in."
2019-01-18,5,"Efficient, fast and friendly service; could not fault them. A vast improvement on my previous experiences."
2019-01-18,5,I was very impressed with the quality of the service and the whole experience from beginning to end was excellent. Minor point that a stud on my floormat was broken during the valet which I will report separately
2019-01-18,5,"Always well looked after and welcome,"
2019-01-18,5,"highly recommend, being disabled they collect my car from home and deliver it back. MOT'd cleaned and vacuumed, lovely..."
2019-01-18,1,"I booked my car for a service, covered under a service plan. Advised air con refresh due and agreed this should be conpleted. Advised service assistant there was a noise of water- this to be investigated.
A courtesy car service offered from garage to local train station. I was advised to call to advise what time I wanted to be collected. For the entire duration of the train journey I was on hold, with no response. I eventually hired a cab to take me to be garage to collect my car. 20 minutes later (and counting) having been presented with a bill to address the “water issue” that had been done without authorisation my overall experience has not been good ."
2019-01-18,5,"Good honest service, as it should be with dealerships. Receptionist rang the day before to confirm the appointment was still available. Car was serviced mid afternoon and by late 3 , the service was done with a call from the receptionist highlighting completed service with any advisories required. Volkswagen also film these advisories and email/text a short film clip of a walk around of the vehicle is a really good customer centric idea.

I have"
2019-01-18,3,"Arrived at the Mercedes Benz Depot to have the car serviced and discovered that it had moved - all the gates were closed. Unfortunately Mercedes Benz did not advise me of the fact that they had moved. I had to google the address and eventually arrived at their new depot 30 minutes late.
Handed the car over and waited for the courtesy car I had booked. Twenty minutes later I was advised that there was no courtesy car available. They suggested that they could have a driver take me back home but I would have to wait a while for this. Eventually after 30 minutes a driver arrived to take me home.
Needless to say without a car for the day this was completely inconvenient but nothing could be done!"
2019-01-18,2,Customer services let’s BMW down mechanics do a good job wouldn’t recommend BMW Mercedes offer better customer services
2019-01-18,5,The service I got from Lexus Derby was 10 out of 10 thank you
2019-01-18,5,"Just bough a Range Rover Sport from Preston Inchcape and am absolutely delighted with it. The salesman Alan Wood was professional, helpful and friendly without being pushy. He listened to our wish list and went through every aspect of the car we were buying and made sure we were happy . Alan was very patient and any questions were answered with great knowledge and made the experience of buying the car a pleasure. Would definitely recommend Landrover Preston, and in particular Alan , thank you so much"
2019-01-18,5,"No pressure from the salesperson,allowed me to drive several cars,very courteous,the second hand car I bought looks brand new,plus 3 year warranty"

2019-01-18,3,"X1 booked in for brake fluid service
First thing to say is that the work was completed and the car, having also been valeted, returned in good time.
On arrival a few minutes before the scheduled time I noted the 'Service Reception' sign directly in front so headed there and announced myself to the receptionist. I was advised that I needed to go back to the Welcome' desk as they had the paperwork. Returning to said desk I was invited to go to the waiting area.whilst they dealt with it. I declined and said I would remain here 'thank you'. Within 30sec the paperwork was taken the 10 steps to the service desk whereupon I was called forward.
Intentionally or otherwise this felt like being processed rather than treated as a customer whose arrival at this time was anticipated. I had after all been called the day before to confirm the appointment.
Too clinical for my liking"
2019-01-18,5,Helpful and polite. A clear video of areas of concern sent from the service team. All finished on time.
2019-01-18,5,"Location easy to find, staff very friendly and convenient servises (they videoed my whole inspection and emailed it to me).

They also offer discount if you do combined service + MOT which I am definitely doing in June."
2019-01-18,5,All the staff were very friendly and helpful. They were happy to accommodate all our needs.
2019-01-18,5,Excellent friendly and timely service
2019-01-18,5,"Car was booked in for a recall fix, no problems easy book in and collect with health check complimentary wash and clean"
2019-01-18,5,"Excellent! Took my car for a recall on Wednesday. Although I expected my car abit earlier, the team were very friendly and engaging... I was even asked if I wanted a coffee!! Nice touch.
As my parking sensor was not working I decided to take it back to their garage. I was greeted by a very friendly guy who came outside took the bumper of and fixed it free of charge. Pure class. They have an even more loyal BMW customer now."
2019-01-18,5,Very good for thanks guys
2019-01-17,5,All staff are so welcoming and accommodating! It’s not easy trying to keep a toddler entertained whilst waiting on your car but the staff offered me a drink allowed him to totter around with no judgement. My car was efficiently serviced in good time.
2019-01-17,5,Great service. David and the team got my new car sorted and on the road in an afternoon.
2019-01-17,2,"I purchased a brand new 2018 Tiguan in August. This was the most expensive advance payment I had invested. Unfortunately, the car has broken down thrice!!!. The issue was the same with the sensors on the car. The hazard sign blocked most of the information on the driver dashboard and there is a regular warning noise. This car could be driven however anyone sane would be left insane at the end of the journey with the constant hazard noise at regular interval and this was a car for my autistic son who is very sensitive to sound and this causes him anxiety and he attacks us. The car is still with the dealer with no resolution till an update is available from Volkswagen. I had researched and spent a lot of time deciding about a car and all my time and energy has been wasted I have completely lost confidence in this brand and the service was also so so. Even though I told that due to my special circumstances they have to take it off my hands I was told that there is nothing much they could do till a software update. Volkswagen didn't want to look at the car as they classed the car as 'road worthy'. I'm shocked that a company like this can take a customers complaint so casually and dump the car in spite of the problem it might create. From my experience, I can only deduce Inscape don't care about customers and are only sales focused!!."
2019-01-17,3,"Upon collecting my car we noticed the car mats were missing, not a big deal especially when the salesman assured us that he would get a set posted to us. 10 days on, no car mats and none of our multiple calls have been returned, despite assurances from Management.

What should be a seamless and enjoyable experience has been tarnished by poor aftercare, lack of communication, and failure to deliver on what was said and in my opinion the basics.

Having purchased cars from both Vauxhall and Seat, they both put Coopers BMW to shame.

Seeing as none of our calls get returned I’m not expecting a response to this message, however hopefully our experience and feedback will encourage others to look elsewhere and not be left in the dark and having to chase something that I quote “is included as standard”."
2019-01-17,2,Took my car in for a service. Explained on the phone when booking that the car had a service pack entitling to free service. Told the girl at the desk when dropping the car off the same thing. Only to get a phone call trying to charge over £200 for things included in the service pack. When I dropped my car off and on the phone when booking I was told my car would be washed and valeted. On collecting the car...shock... car not washed. This is my second bad experience with BMW cobham. Won’t be visiting or buying from them in the future.
2019-01-17,5,Prompt attention when bringing car in for service. When returned car had been washed and valeted. During intervening period the inner man was kept well supplied with tea (coffee also available). Very satisfactory experience.
2019-01-17,5,Excellent experience dealing with this company when buying my new car. Professional and friendly staff made everything a pleasure.
2019-01-17,5,"Consistently good customer service provided by the Team at Inchcape Stratford Upon Avon. They are an efficient, welcoming and friendly team who conduct themselves with professional integrity at all times. Keep up the great work!
Many thanks
Sweeny"
2019-01-17,5,"Very professional, attenative to personal needs.

The car was in for a recall, and the work was carried out professionally. The video sent about the checks on the car was very informative, and th e follow up information was excellent."
2019-01-17,5,"Dan the Salesman was excellent to deal with, responsive and even came in on his day off to hand over the car. Great service"
2019-01-17,5,Always a friendly service
2019-01-17,5,"I have been a client of Cooper Malton for many years and have never received a bad experience from any department. I find them to be obliging, friendly and most helpful and willing to go the extra mile to give a good service. I would certainly recommend Cooper Malton."
2019-01-17,2,"You sorted the problem with the car but it is always the customer service element that gives me (and my fellow customers in the waiting area) so much grief. I waited 25 mins before someone came out of the service office to hand me back my car which I had been told was ready. You then couldn't find it as you thought it was parked on the front forecourt, then to top it off your service representative left the courtesy car key in my car which I had to divert to bring back to you. I have had Toyotas, VWs and Vauxhalls who all beat you for customer service standards, only Ford were as bad as you."
2019-01-17,5,"An excellent experience as usual, hard to meet anything as good as the professional setup."
2019-01-17,5,"Brilliant customer service, friendly staff. Car valeted too!"
2019-01-17,5,"Excellent service. Friendly, helpful receptionist with excellent customer skills. Very rare these days. Thank you."
2019-01-17,2,"I was asked to arrive at 9am with my car, living in Lowestoft meant travelling in rush hour to arrive on time, when booking there was not a courtesy car available so my husband also had to drive, on arrival I was told the car would be ready in the afternoon, told the receptionist that I would rather it was done as early as possible given that we lived in Lowestoft and therefore we’re going to spend the day in Norwich, I didn’t feel I was listened to and reiterated and gave my telephone number to contact me when it was ready...... we arrived back at the showroom at 4.15pm and was told my car was being worked on, to have a seat and coffee and my adviser would come and find me when it was ready, at 4.45pm I went to the desk to see if it was ready to be told my adviser was with a customer and would come and see me when done, she didn’t, I had to go and enquire again at 5pm, car not ready and conversation ensued with little satisfaction on my part, none of those receptionists ‘listen’ - 5.15pm, still not ready, finally just before 5.30pm I was approached to say my car is ready, to be given the wrong key!! Will not be buying or servicing any vehicles with this company again."
2019-01-17,5,"Although we travelled a long distance to Cooper BMW, it was well worth it. All the staff we came across were very pleasant and polite. In particular, Michael Deo in Sales who we dealt with was extremely helpful. We had seen the car we wanted on line and decided to make the journey North - we were not disappointed! We would definitely recommend Cooper BMW Teesside."
2019-01-17,5,"Bought a second hand vehicle from Cooper York BMW. The friendliness and professionalism of the company itself aside (excellent, by the way), Alex Frear, the sales executive was fantastic. He was very clear, honest and competent. He was also reliable and thoughtful and made the whole process really smooth. No silly sales pressure etc. Came in on his day off to allow us to pick up the car at a convenient time. Credit to his profession and to his company."
2019-01-17,5,"I bought a mini from, mini in Colchester and I’m so in love with it! George who helped me with the car was brilliant knew what he was talking about and helped me with the finance! I’m in love with the car and will definitely be using mini Colchester again!! So thank you!!"
2019-01-17,5,Always fab service from the Tetbury team. Thanks guys!
2019-01-17,5,"Very impressed with the Mini service, including the washing and valeting. Thank you George for being so helpful."
2019-01-17,4,"Telephone booking was not put onto the system but once verified Inchcape took over and were excellent, they were able to meet booking times for service, MOT and valet."
2019-01-16,5,"The staff at Inchcape Toyota Kindlington were fantastic. Friendly and helpful, doing their best to work around my needs. They were honest and there was no pushiness. I am delighted with my new hybrid car."
2019-01-16,4,Very good service and helpful staff Connor and Marvin where very good
2019-01-16,5,Great company to deal with.
2019-01-16,5,Great service could not fault bmw
2019-01-16,5,"Three factors made my recent BMW 5 Series purchase the easiest car acquisition in my half century of driving. I sold my previous car privately beforehand then used Car Wow and finally chose Coopers from the 6 dealerships who responded; they matched the lowest price quoted without hesitation. From start to finish everyone at Coopers were professional, helpful and friendly without being at all ‘pushy’. Promises and deadlines were adhered to and the whole process went without a hitch. The salesman, Edward Webster, was very thorough and patient with me when explaining all the various functions of the vehicle."
2019-01-16,4,After months of waiting for the recall battery cable problem to be fixed. I was booked in on 14 February. Overall am satisfied with the service received. Staff were polite and helpful. A free health check and car wash was also offered on the day which I gladly accepted. Thank you BMW
2019-01-16,5,Really Impressed. Extremely helpful and very impressed with the Vehicle health video.
2019-01-16,4,Visited the Banstead offices for a simple warranty check and service and received very polite and helpful advice.
2019-01-16,5,"Appointment was met on time, courtesy car was on time, service was excellent, job completed quickly"
2019-01-16,5,"Excellent car service and MOT, and kept me informed along the way by phone and video of all work required."
2019-01-16,3,"Good service, I HOPE, but contacting Mini Cooper disgraceful.

Phoned Mini Cooper, selected option 2 for the Mini Service option. After talking to what I thought was the service DEPARTMENT, I was transferred to someone else as 1st person unable to answer my query.
Spoke to 2nd person who eventually told me I had been transferred to the wrong department. They transferred me again to the 3rd person and low and behold, once again I was transferred to the wrong department. This last person took my number and Mini Cooper phoned me.

If the inability to transfer a simple call to the correct extension creates such a problem, what can we expect of a service?

Hope to see an improvement at my next service."
2019-01-16,4,"I liked the reminder by text, though 24hrs notice would be better - on the date of service is too late in my opinion.
Courteous and efficient staff.
The car received a valet service as part of the service. The interior was fresh and smelt really lovely."
2019-01-16,5,Very good experience. Friendly staff and good communication. Nice lounge (for the while-you-wait experience!) with coffee. I bought my car there and always come back for MOT/Services.
2019-01-16,4,"Booking in of the car went well. I received a video inspection of the car which was good however, there was a slight problem with one of the tyres as it was slightly under inflated. I would have expected them to inflate the tyre to the correct pressure but they didn't!"
2019-01-16,5,"Amy Stickley was our sales Advisor and she was absolutely amazing with updating me with every little step when my car wasn’t in Swindon. Couldn’t ask for anymore help, she answered any questions we had and now I have a new A1 because of her😁thank you very much Amy! Would recommend Audi Swindonl! Thank you Amy😁"

2019-01-15,5,"Excellent help in finding the right car for me, both from Alex, from the sales team, and from the finance team. Thank you"
2019-01-15,5,"was fast and efficient, bring your own paper though. was advised I could sit and read papers whilst I waited but they don't have them anymore. car was cleaned throughout. good work"
2019-01-15,5,Excellent customer service - always kept us informed from the first call enquiring about the vehicle through to sale. Will be happy to use for our next BMW purchase.

Couldn't ask for more from Coopers BMW Durham"

2019-01-15,5,"Excellent customer service from start to finish.

Facilitated the work in a diligent manner."
2019-01-15,4,Whilst I am happy with what was done it seemed strange the service was not done at the same time as it means another visit for this.
2019-01-15,5,Most helpful and professional service - highly recommend
2019-01-15,5,"Fantastic service. Organising the service was very easy. The reception was very efficient and the service itself was very quick. Your video told me everything I needed to know and allowed me to show it to my son for his approval !!
Thank you."
2019-01-15,5,"Thoroughly professional operation, technically and otherwise - very helpful from reception onwards, large clean waiting area with wifi etc and good coffee!"
2019-01-15,1,"Was complete waste of time.
Told 9 things wrong with the car and the guy did not understand all the things and we discussed it after 4 hrs wait to tell me I can come back to sort them out.
Requested invoice and any written informations, and no reply at all for the whole week."
2019-01-15,5,"Staff very polite and gave a excellent service during the sale of my new Yaris Icon Tech I am delighted with the way i was treated and
would like to thank the Sales Team for efforts and hard work"
2019-01-15,5,"Great service from Leon once again, this is the second car I have purchased from this dealer. Both times I was very pleased with the vehicles I purchased."
2019-01-15,5,"Big thumbs up to the team at Coopers BMW, they helped me out with my 2nd hand BMW to get it checked out before a dead line, they put me as priority because they knew I had a problem.
Abby at the front desk couldn’t of been more helpful and I’m very grateful for all her help. All the staff that I came into contact with were very polite and friendly. I would recommend Coopers BMW to anyone"
2019-01-15,4,Prompt efficient polite service
2019-01-15,5,BMW Sunderland were very friendly and polite. They also were very helpful also took very good care of you. Excellent service.
2019-01-15,4,"Generally service went well. The only downside is my car was booked in for a recall at the same time as the service. I was told later in the day the parts required for the recall were not available. Bad planning as they knew the work was being done, it was booked in a month before so parts should have been allocated for the job. It means the customer has to make another visit to get the job completed.
The only other issue is misting on the inside of the front indicator lease. I was told this is ‘normal’. Water or moisture and electrics do not normally mix well so will keep an eye on this. Of all the cars I have had I have never experienced this unless of course the sealed unit has failed."
2019-01-15,5,"I would recommend this dealership.
Everything effortlessly done for you the sales people especially Scott always went the extra mile to make sure all was perfect.
On a score out of 10 it would be 10.
Many thanks to Scott for all your help."
2019-01-15,1,"I replied to the original mail to let them know they had the wrong person and I certainly do not have a car booked in with them.... they ignored this and asked me for a review!
Not that concerned about letting a stranger have name and registration etc....
My review is
More attention to detail
Read e-mails
Change details as requested"
2019-01-15,5,"Couldn't ask for better service at Audi. They are always so accommodating and friendly. Emma from Swindon Audi was brilliant as she was very friendly when helping with my mot booking. We had a question about my pcp plan and someone from sales overheard and stopped to help. I will only have my Audi checked in here for services, mot or repairs."
2019-01-15,4,"I was informed by the Land Rover dealer that my Discovery required a software update. Because I required a courtesy car, the next time slot available was a month later.
On the morning of the service I arrived at the dealership, the building design looks very impressive and the service representative effectively took all the detail of the work required. She politely showed me to the courtesy car and handed over the keys. Great service so far.
At 16.30 I connected them to ask about collecting my vehicle and was informed that there would be a charge for an oil & filter change. The car had gone in for warranty work, so I disputed the cost. Upon arrival at the dealers to collect my car the service representative informed me that there would now be no charge and promptly arranged for my car. I checked the work and found thar they hadn’t completed one of the tasks. Very disappointing and I had to wait for them to complete the simple task.
Conclusion: Overall good customer service with an impressive futurist building. However they were let down due to poor attention to detail."
2019-01-14,5,Fantastic service. Use of technology to give all round view of car and interior was excellent. Very reassuring when buying a car over 300 miles away!
2019-01-14,5,"bought a used car here, Dan Stott our salesman was great, very professional. Nothing was too much trouble."
2019-01-14,4,Car Service - good service from staff from start to finish.
2019-01-14,4,Good advice and attention to detail putting customers needs 1st. Although I didn’t get my car when I expected and really wanted they kept me informed all the way and were pleasantly professional. They worked hard to get me the best deal they could with good friendly suggestions along the way.
2019-01-14,4,"Bringing my car in for the BMW recall was a pleasant experience, and I would certainly recommend the company in future."
2019-01-14,5,125% in every way when dealing with us and cars are brilliant
2019-01-14,5,From the moment I enquired to the day I picked up the car the staff were very polite and helpful. best car buying experience I have had
2019-01-14,5,"Excellent Service, the staff was very helpful and i felt like nothing would have been to much trouble. I was allowed to pickup my vehicle the next day rather than late afternoon.

PS I also had a courtesy car.

Thank you all, Kind regards

2019-01-14,1,"Land Rover Derby. My wife just wasted 30 mins on the phone, passed round Derby then the call was put over to a 'booking service' in Preston. The guy was useless, rude and condescending. This is not the first time this has happened to her - the sales dinosaurs are just as bad. Do Inchcape treat all female customers this way?"
2019-01-14,3,"Slow punctures reported - but no feedback post service. Were the suspected punctures rectified?

2019-01-14,5,"Matteo was great, due to illness I had several salesmen but Matteo was the last one I dealt with and he was lovely"
2019-01-14,2,incredibly slow to book car in - manufacturer recall on timing chain yet unable to deal with the issue without authorisation - slow to let car out again - this is why I stopped buying bmws 10 years ago .every time a bmw out of warranty is inspected there is always a raft of issues that supposedly need dealing with yet when checked at other reputable garage supposed attention points not correct
2019-01-14,1,"Unfortunately my purchase from Mercedes derby was not good.
Tim and James were excellent but where let down by the very disappointing receptionist who seemed unable to relay messages that I had been trying to contact them numerous times a day to the point of utter frustration .
This resulted in me driving to collect my car and having a Phone call to say finance couldn’t be sorted out something that could have been resolved in the week . This issue was resolved by a very professional James but on inspection of my new vehicle I was very disappointed at the standard vehicles are sent out . I bought my part ex vehicle back cleaner and with more fuel then the one I was picking up . I now have to take my new car to be valeted a extra cost to myself and you will put my vehicle straight on the forecourt as it’s cleaner then anything insure too get it to a place I’m happy.
I will not purchase another vehicle from Mercedes derby as apparently the cars are allowed to go to there new homes filthy with bogies on the back of the steering wheel dirty door pockets and under the seats was a disgrace and side bars are covered in tar . All easily fixed with a good clean . Not a happy customer."
2019-01-14,5,"Great service as always, could not ask for more."
2019-01-14,5,The service team carried out their work speedily and effectively.
2019-01-14,5,Good service and kept me updated throughout.
2019-01-14,3,"Having to take your BMW in for a recall is a pain but they try hard to make it as pleasant as possible and offered a wash, vac and fluid top up for the vehicle. The work was conducted on time and with no issues and a full report was provided. However, when I collected my car, no wash, no vac and fluids were ""probably"" topped up. Not the five star experience promised."
2019-01-14,4,The service from the garage was good. However the service plus wash lasted 2 and a half hours rather than the 1 and a half indicated when booking.
2019-01-14,5,"I feel as though the service provided by Kate was detailed, efficient and to a high standard."
2019-01-14,5,Nothing more to add than 5 Stars. A seamless experience from start to finish. The new car is great! Thanks to Sam & everyone at Inchcape Notts.
2019-01-14,4,"Straight forward. No rush in bringing back the Courtsey car. Service advisor Rodney took his time to explain faults that have been found on the car unlike previous experience where I was rushed in and out. Has restored my faith in this branch of INchape. Only one problem, said they hoovered the car and it wasnt :)"
2019-01-14,5,Excellent service

2019-01-11,5,"I recently bought a Mercedes SLK (FG65 WEX) from Nottingham Mercedes.

I had the pleasure of dealing with Pete Ward. He was extremely professional throughout the whole transaction.

His knowledge of the SLK was first class. He was patient with our questions and remained attentive at all times.

He was courteous and displayed values of integrity and respect towards me and my wife as customers.

Pete Ward went the extra mile in terms of preparation of the vehicle. The car was a Birthday surprise for my wife. Pete placed a reserved for Angela sign clearly in the front window. He positioned the car in front of the main entrance so as we walked in Angela could see it. He had arranged for the car to be cleaned to a very high standard before our arrival. This act that Pete did was a key factor in our purchase decision process.

Pete took the time and consideration to talk us through the right financial package offered by Mercedes so that we could purchase the vehicle with confidence.

Pete Ward is a credit to your organisation.

We would recommend Nottingham Mercedes to anyone interested in buying a Mercedes car. A very well run and professional environment is on offer to prospective customers. Excellent service with humility as a core value that we were greeted with from front desk to final purchase."
2019-01-11,2,"Booked my car in for recall about an hours work,dropped it off at 8 30 got phone call at about 13 30 saying my car was next to be done,told caller that needed my car for that night and going away early in morning for the weekend,was told would be ready and would keep me informed.Called at 17 40 as had heard nothing and was told it was next to be done! So my car was sitting there for 9 hours untouched would have taken it in later if aware of this ! When I picked car up at 6 30 was told they didn’t have time to carry out the courtesy clean and if I was passing pop in and they would do it.So as you can imagine not impressed by the service,I know it was not a chargeable job but expected a better service"
2019-01-11,5,"Good very helpful service, vehicle was ready and cleaned earlier than the time quoted."

2019-01-11,5,"This has been the best experience I’ve had in buying a car over the last 25 year. The whole process was simple, straightforward and relaxed. Grant Dodsworth the sales exec was excellent, clearly explained all of the process and made it an easy choice to buy from the dealership. Highly recommend and I’ll definitely be returning when I’m due to change my car in the future."
2019-01-11,4,"First oil change on SQ5 - actual oil change etc all ok (I presume!) However, very disappointed with wash and vacuum (complimentary) as wash was virtually non existent and vacuum only done in front foot wells. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have had poor ‘valets’ from Audi Tetbury - however, saying that, I still think they are a good garage/dealer having bought 5 new cars through them (and servicing) over the last 7/8 years"
2019-01-11,4,"BMW 335 required safety recall work. Called October 2018 to arrange but first available date was January 2019 and I was disappointed that BMW could not arrange for a courtesy car to be made available to me.

However, my visit to Cooper BMW Norwich yesterday was good. A pleasant lady helped me at reception and the work was carried out within the time frame given. All very efficient and great to deal with."
2019-01-11,5,"Car booked in for MOT, staff pleasant and accommodating. Phone call to let me know car was ready, car valeted while at garage.
Very good service overall."
2019-01-11,5,Great service first class staff
2019-01-11,1,"Rubbish dealership. Rubbish customer service. Rude employees from the sales exec to the managers. Would never ever recommend anyone to go here. And if you’re a coloured person, don’t bother going as you will be treated like crap!"
2019-01-11,5,"Very prompt attention upon arrival. I have been to other BMW garages where, to be honest, you are made to hang around and are generally not looked after. This was not the case at Cooper Reading."
2019-01-11,5,"I was very well looked after from initial appointment call to being on site. Everything was clearly explained and everything was done on my car as expected. I waited whilst my car was being serviced and was made comfortable with coffee, etc and was looked after well by Ashley"
2019-01-10,5,"Excellent customer service with excellent communication throughout the day. Video, Telephone, Text information received and a friendly, informative and fully briefed meeting with a very competent service advisor upon collection. This experience exceeded expectations."
2019-01-10,5,Good reception and service staff. Follow up great.
2019-01-10,3,service too bureaucratic and ponderous
2019-01-10,5,Fantastic service all round
2019-01-10,5,Excellent and efficient service
2019-01-10,5,Excellent service thank you
2019-01-10,5,"Had a recall from bmw to have a positive cable replaced, so came here to coopers Cobham as not nearest, but easy to get to. Wonderful ladies on reception,(had a good chat )and handling the work to be done.work was done in a couple of hours as I had been told, so went for a stroll. Nice waiting area, with coffee and biscuits, nice touch. If ever having to have the car sorted could be classified as enjoyable, then this is it! Courteous and helpful staff, and efficient mechanics."
2019-01-10,5,Charlie is a credit to Audi. Everything made easy and the car delivered on time and immaculate. Thanks
2019-01-10,1,"Don’t bother going to Inchcape Macclesfield for your VW ,we travelled around 10-15 miles from our home this morning to look and maybe test drive a VW TIGUAN.
We were in the forecourt for around 20 minutes to 30 minutes , not one sales person bothered coming out to talk to us, one of them did walk past and looked at us and walked away, so we left , never going there again even though it’s our nearest VW dealership."
2019-01-10,3,"Took Range Rover in for MOT on Wednesday 9th January with agreement that as it should not take more than 3/4 of a hour I would wait. Booked in for 13:30; arrived 13:25. Car ready at 16:00, a wait of two and a half hours!!! 3 coffees helped.
Other waiting customers were not happy."
2019-01-09,5,"Timely, reliable, helpful and professional"
2019-01-09,5,"What a friendly dealership! All staff members smiled and said hello, not just the ones dealing with me. Did what they said they would, and in the time stated. Quoted a price for work, but no pressure whatsover to have the work done. I'll be going back to them."
2019-01-09,5,"Bought a 5series tourer sport , both Eddy and his Manager were great . Top marks and faultless service , will get my next car from them"
2019-01-09,5,Excellent customer care
2019-01-09,5,Customer service staff are very good. The service staff are informative and arranged a courtesy car. The video explanation of issues found during the service is excellent.
2019-01-09,5,"Everyone was most helpful and polite
Ali kept me informed of the progress and the environment was comfortable to wait in for my car to be ready"
2019-01-09,4,"Swift service and attentive staff. I only docked one star because they could not answer all of my questions there and then, but did book me back in asap, so that was fine."
2019-01-09,3,"I have just bought a beautiful used xf portfolio from inchcape. The reception and sales staff are professional and attentive with a high end showroom and great coffee! All the advertising from inchcape promises over 140 checks to your used car and trained jaguar technicians etc. My car looked amazing when I picked it up, gleaming and polished, unfortunately when I got home, a 1hr and 20 minute drive, I immediately found a fault with the complicated keyless central locking system which meant I could'nt lock the car or fold the mirrors etc. I also found a splattering of some cleaning agent on the inside of the drivers windscreen and on the dials which made the drive home interesting and when I moved the seats paper and a used coffee cup holder fell out of the side. I had to waste a day back at the garage, the car had to stay 2 days to be repaired and have new parts fitted. to add insult to injury I had paid £70.00 to have the tank filled with petrol and have used 1/3rd of it to have the fixed!
The package I have bought with 2 years jag warranty and breakdown assistance is designed to give peace of mind, I just didn't expect to use the warranty within 3 hours. Full marks to the front of house team at inchcape for doing their job well but you have been let down in this instance by who ever did the vehicle checks and detailing. My last 4 cars have been bought from a car supermarket in Hull and I have never had any problems buying my cars from them, I expected even more from a Jaguar main dealer and have been disappointed.
ps for all the inconvienence inchcape should at least have replaced the petrol used to bring the car back!!
pps this is my partners site , my name is ian martin"
2019-01-09,5,Excellent service from the team throughout from test drive to selection and delivery of my car.
2019-01-09,5,"Excellent customer service, from the meet and greet at the entrance to the collection of my car.
I was Impressed with the facilities on offer to the customer, if waiting for your car. The booking in and collection was a simple process.
I received a phone call and my car was ready to drive away at the time stated. I would have no reservations about recommending this company."
2019-01-09,3,Was called to say car was ready for collection However when we arrived to collect we were kept waiting for forty five minutes due to our advisor being busy on the phone. It was only when I complained did they get another advisor who was free to let us pick up the car
2019-01-08,3,"Had no idea, when the car would be picked up. Had to query with Arval, to get an idea. Not picked up until after 12pm. Received at text at 3.30pm, to say car on way. Did not arrive until past 5.30pm. Obvious car had been cleaned and looked quite good. However rear passenger windows still dirty and stained. Video received was interesting, and additional information."
2019-01-08,3,"Straightforward job of BMW recall. Service area considerably reshaped, very few staff in evidence, communicated by video and text message and when car collected, no feedback at all about state of battery, which I had specifically asked them to investigate. So sign
s of improvement in the service area, but not sure if it is for the better."
2019-01-08,4,"No problems at all. Used the collection service and car was delivered back at a reasonable time. I was sent a video whilst my car was in.
The only thing I didn’t particularly like was that the display had been altered along with radio station and position of seat was nearly horizontal"
2019-01-08,4,"Good level of overall service at Cooper BMW Norwich branch when I had to take my 3 Series in recently for a battery terminal recall. The process took a bit longer than anticipated (I was on the site for over 3 hours in the end), although this did include a free health check and wash of the vehicle as well so was worth the wait, all free too of course so can't complain! The facilities were also top notch which helped to make the time pass a bit. Very happy customer overall, many thanks!"
2019-01-08,1,"Left a disappointing review regarding the BMW Cooper garage in Purley way. Was advised to email in, I did but no reply"
2019-01-08,5,"I had an appointment at 10.00 and they were ready for me. They suggested the work would be completed by 16.00, and it was. The car had also been spruced up externally which was much appreciated."
2019-01-08,4,"I have used Jaguar for many years-however, the new E-Pace s200 is disappointing the Jaguar XF in my opinion is far more comfortable and quiet."
2019-01-08,5,Excellent customer service
2019-01-08,3,All good with service but the car collection was a nightmare - took 45 mins and was complete change from previous personal mini experience . I complained and the gen manager apologised and said combining bmw and mini reception was only temporary but due to staff shortages .
2019-01-06,2,forgot the MOT and stamp up service book
2019-01-06,1,"Appalling service. Having been told my free warranty check & MOT would take 2 hours I declined a courtesy car - opting to work in the hotel next door. The day before I was told it also needed a part replacing due to it being recalled which would now increase the time to 5 hours, but no courtesy cars were now available. I decided to run to & from the garage as there was no other option & I run regularly. The 5 hours turned into 7.5 hrs, but having been told just before 4pm the car would be ready just before 5pm, I left the house about 10 minutes later & ran the 3.5 miles in the rain. Upon arriving I was told it would take another 1hr 15 minutes, I was left with no choice but to sit in the garage soaking wet & freezing cold until the car was ready. Whilst they may have waived the price of the MOT in recognition I would much preferred to have been told the correct information about how long it would take (a) when I booked (b) when I was told I could pick the car up. I will never use Cooper again & would recommend Grosvenor BMW. who I have used previously for servicing for far superior service."
2019-01-06,5,Service from all staff excellent - as always.
2019-01-06,5,"From ordering my new FPace in November to picking it up a few days ago, the service from Wayne and Shaun has been great. Very happy with Inchcape Southampton and will be recommending and using in the future."
2019-01-05,5,Good service!.
2019-01-05,5,"I recently purchased a new VW golf from Inchape, Shrewsbury.

Michael, the sales executive was incredibly patient and went out of his way to assist me in the process of securing my dream car. He took any stress away from the process of purchasing as well as part exchanging and was extremely helpful and up-front. No favour was too much trouble! Extra time was taken to personalise the experience, through providing video updates of my car at the various stages up until the day of collection. Thanks to Mike, I was able to make an informed decision on the right car to suit my needs and lifestyle.

Further, Mark the manager was also incredibly helpful and personable and both Mark and Mike went out of their way to secure me a great deal. Communication was fantastic and I would highly recommend purchasing a car from this dealers! 5* - one very happy customer! Thank you :)"
2019-01-05,5,"Great service, car fixed cleaned and delivered back. Five stars!"
2019-01-05,5,Excellent - 5 stars
2019-01-05,5,"Bought a second hand BMW from Cooper BMW Reading.

The attention to detail was excellent, never before have I had such an attentive salesman for a second hand vehicle. There were no high pressure sales pitches and the car was also delivered on time and in an excellent presentable condition.

Thanks to Charles at Cooper BMW Reading. It really was a pleasure doing business with you."
2019-01-05,5,Car went in for a recall. Service was carried out on time and prompt. Coffee on tap and comfortable seating area. Staff were pleasant and available and very approachable. The only thing is I don’t exactly know what went on with my car??
2019-01-05,5,Good reliable service. Courteous staff at Banstead. Authentic BMW parts. Used every year for the past 10 years.
2019-01-05,5,"Easy booking process to have brake issue investigated. Dropped car off on agreed date and courtesy lift given to place of work promptly. Car ready and issue rectified. All the staff at Reading Mini Cooper were friendly and professional. I received an email containing a video of the inspection carried out on my car which talked through the condition of the underside of my car including brake cables, pads, discs, tyres. Excellent service and I would highly recommend."
2019-01-05,5,The service at inchcape is always excellent . I have had VW cars for a few years now and always go to Inchcape for services and anything that needs doing .
2019-01-05,3,"UPDATE: 08/01/2019

I would like thank Team Coopers for the reurn of my car coat and for putting my trust back into Coopers BMW of Croydon. I will put my ""one off"" experience down to the busy holiday period. I would recommend Coopers of Croydon for BMW as the cars and staff are always of the highest standard and aim to please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


It all started so well, the sales guy was great. He was polite and very helpful. My first year driving a BMW was great but then the service. My car was collected by a really pleasant chap and he explained my car would be back in around five to six hours. It was, less my car coat and plus a sticky door with the rubber drivers door seal half chewed away. Not being aggressive or throwing accusations I called Coopers BMW FIVE times over the period of a week. Each call was treated with respect but each time I was promised a call back but each time NOTHING! I made all the excuses possible for the impolite way I was treated, xmas period, short staff, very busy and I also made the excuses for my missing coat (which the person removing the coat kindly removed my driving specs and left them on the front seat) ""someone cleaning my car had obviously removed my coat but forgot to put it back, a person picked up my coat whilst cleaning the interior and dropped my specs but when picking up my specs dropped my coat.... but Coopers reaction was, no one remembers seeing your coat in the car, not the driver, niether the engineer or the valet guys. Yes my jacket was reasonbly new, yes it was a designer jacket but who wants someone else's car coat? Who takes a week to look for a missing coat, who makes promises to call you back and leaves you frustrated awaiting a call that never comes.... A SELECT FEW AT COOPERS CROYDON! To top off my frustrations I was explained that I should take time out to visit Coopers so that an engineer can look a the rubber seal and sticky door! Thanks but no thanks. P.S, I very rarely give negative feedback to anybody anywhere, but to be ignored by a select few and to be made to feel like a criminal when you are the victim makes my blood boil. (it's six am in the morning and im still feeling upset and frustrated ...)"
2019-01-04,5,"We were well looked after by Raj Gill, maling it a pleasure to purchase from Toyota."
2019-01-04,3,"Booked my car in for a service over 5 weeks proir to attendance and was confirmed to have a courtesy car. At 4 pm the day before my car was due in n the garage I get a call from a member of the service team to tell me there are no courtesy cars available. This now meant I had to find alternative way into work and back as my car would not be ready - with no courtesy car as promised. This was extra unbudgeted costs.
Wasn’t particularly impressed with the agants’s level of customer service either.

I also asked for my car to be washed and cleaned after the service, and although the car was cleaned the alloy wheels were terrible with some parts cleaned at other part not touched and still filthy.

I loved the service inspection Video and this was the highlight and a unique touch so well done to the mechanic who filmed. He came across very well. I had some minor repair work done and the miracle repair guy was excellent too in reassurance and explaining what was going to be done to my car. My review would have been 2 (or less) stars if not for these two areas related to my Car Service at Coopers.

Not the best experience I’ve had in a car showroom. My wife has just got a new Honda And when I went there for a routine visit last month the level of customer service was amazing. Would definitely have expected more from BMW!"
2019-01-04,5,"Hi we found Megan very helpful and friendly , I would definitely recommend buying from Mini Durham in the future."
2019-01-04,5,"MAIDSTONE Audi
Service including new rear discs and pads.
Excellent service highly recommend loved the Audi cam which kept me informed"
2019-01-04,5,"Great service, with good working area while I wait.
Way better service than Maidenhead!"
2019-01-04,5,Delivered car on day arranged. Courtesy car waiting for me. Phone call at end of day informing me all jobs done and passed. Arranged to call following day to return courtesy car and collect mine. Absolutely excellent service. No reservations whatsoever - A***** would definitely recommend this company.
2019-01-04,5,"Great customer service and model recommendation.

the whole experience was easy from start to finish"
2019-01-03,5,Excellent. First time I’ve had my car serviced here and it was faultless. Happy customer!
2019-01-03,5,Efficient and friendly
2019-01-03,1,"HA HA HA what a joker company Inchcape is! I live in South Yorkshire, the car i bought was from Kent Asked steven barleycorn at Tunbridge Wells Audi if i could inspect the car on a ramp answer was yes. (this was never done) went back a week later to pick up the car, asked if i could inspect the car as i didn't get a chance last time, he said no. come up with some crap saying they do a 149 point check on every used car. Please bare in mind this a 3.0L A8L. Now a week later oil light comes on, Inchcape HAD to top this up as it was picked up within 7 days. In the same week i hears this rattling noise on every start up, WHAT is it?????? It's the bloody timing chain and the tensioner that has failed! BRILLIANT !! Now while the car is with an Audi dealership close to me they pointed out to me that the Brake Fluid is over due, there is no history of the A/C being carried out. Wheel Alignment is required. And the main big expense is the Suspension. Minor Perishing to front suspension lower curved rear arm bushes at a cost of £847.03 inc vat. Now i know why Steven Barleycorn said i can't view the car on the ramps! This is all happened within a week of my owner ship and only travelling 300 miles. I will be using Oldham Audi from now on and i would recommend Oldham Audi to any one. ***Update, please note this is a reply to inchcape*** I do not accept your apology. Bottom line is you sold me a faulty car and on a number of times I have asked you to rectify the problems on the car, but you have failed. You want me to travel from Doncaster to Kent? Even though I offered to take it to inch Cape Audi in Manchester but still you insisted that sales manager in Tunbridge Wells Audi want to see the car at his site. You have a very very unhappy customer."
2019-01-03,5,Kept me informed with the progress of my car Thank you
2019-01-03,5,"From booking the vehicle in to collection very professional. Staff very courteous.
Waited on site for car access to wi~fi, drinks. Able to work whilst waiting"
2019-01-03,5,First class service and would like to mention Connor Brotherton very professional. Took my polo in for a recall and was impressed.Will be going back for the first first service in March.
2019-01-03,5,Very efficient drop-off and collection; good health check video; excellent explanation of the future issues observed through the health check; advised that there was no need to address health check issues immediately.
2019-01-03,5,"Great experience very friendly and they new what to do regarding my service and sorting out a problem. Was sent the video outlining the health check on my wife’s car, excellent. It was washed and ready to pick up on the time we decided. Great work"
2019-01-03,5,"Alex from cooper Ipswich was very helpful, happy with my new car"
2019-01-03,5,Excellent Service and great communication
2019-01-03,5,"Both sales persons, Marie and Ian, were brilliant. They explained everything and made the buying of my Mini Cooper a very pleasant experience at Cooper Reading."
2019-01-03,5,Great customer service from Jordan lovely facilities first time buyer from land rover hope to buy again in future great after care package many thanks
2019-01-03,1,"This was the worst customer experience ever. I am not sure i could ever use coopers Thames Ditton again. Courtesy car booked a month in advance and only told on arrival that not available. Then told i would be fast tracked and it would take 90 min. It ended up taking over 3 and half hours. No apology offered just excuses, customer service manager was not available when requested. Formal complaint has been made with BMW uk. I am still waiting for service manager to call. Sub premium service."
2019-01-03,5,"I took my BMW for a safety recall, when I arrived they informed me an approximate time my car would be ready and offered a courtesy clean of my vehicle, I was also sent a video of a few faults with my vehicle that needed attention, very pleased with the service and attention received."
2019-01-03,5,Went into land rover Norwich parts dept to source some parts and was dealt with by Andrew perkins. He was very helpful and very knowledgeable about the parts I needed. I would definitely go back and deal with him again. Top bloke thank you.
2019-01-03,5,Great service would go back again
2019-01-03,5,Great showroom. Excellent sales team (Yin and Demetrius).
2019-01-02,5,Great purchasing experience at Coopers Reading
2019-01-02,3,"We are very pleased with the car.

The sales staff were very willing and always extremely courteous.

Our salesman was new and taking that into account the process was satisfactory. However he could have done with more supervision and in fact he was placed in difficult circumstances by a lack of assistance when dealing with us. In the end the sales manager did get involved and enabled us to not only purchase the car with the right options but also manage a difficult transition from government grant withdrawal timing.

Overall I was not impressed with the amount of expertise for the plug in hybrid Countryman in the dealership. However let me reiterate that they are very helpful."
2019-01-02,5,I went in to Coopers Ipswich to look at a 1 series i had spotted online. Ryan discussed all of the purchase financial options with me and valued my Boxster S for trade in. The negotiations were fair / frank and a deal was stuck after a successful test drive. Ryan was excellent to deal with. I could not be any happier with the service that i received. i would defiantly recommend Coopers sales and now hope that the servicing dept. are as helpful during the next few years of ownership and under the extended warranty term.
2019-01-02,1,"This company is a complete joke - they are refusing to work on either of my cars due to me leaving a bad review of the way I have been treated!

Anyone considering using inchscape to buy a car - please read the other reviews - they have a serious issue with customer service ( or lack of!)

Currently on the phone to VW head office to rasie a formal complaint"
2019-01-02,4,"Good, efficient and friendly service. Satisfied wit MOT and service but surprised it did not include a complimentary interior and exterior clean too. That would have achieved a 5*"
2019-01-02,5,Great and friendly staff. Stacey who sold me the car was great! And Lucy the manager was fab. They went above and beyond to help me find my dream car!
2019-01-02,5,Really great support from Jack and the service team!! Thank you very much
2019-01-02,5,"Great from first point of contact to the last. Full service, with complimentary valet, worked effectively and efficiently.

Thank you!"
2019-01-01,5,"Friendly, no fuss service.
Knowledgeable sales staff helped me to make a new car purchase with pressure free advice and a quick, supportive process.
If you’re not sure what you’re looking for, I’d recommend a visit."
2019-01-01,5,Very good report from Andrew Robey who dealt with our problems efficiently.
2019-01-01,5,"Having been looking for a new car for a while, Carl helped me by showing me different models with different specs. He then found me a car in Chester and had it brought over to Hyde. He made the whole purchasing experience smooth and easy.
We are now looking to buy my dad a new car from him."
2019-01-01,5,Hillary offfered me an excellent service. She understood my needs and was able to help me purchase my car. Very professional.
2019-01-01,5,"Dealt with two faults at no cost and lent me a courtesy car, would recommend buying from them so far."
2019-01-01,4,Very reliable. Came on time and made contact appropriately and car was brought back cleaned also which was a bonus! No complaints :)
2019-01-01,2,"Update: Although the buying experience was good, I took the car to have winter tyres fitted 4 weeks after purchasing the car, to find that the front and rear tracking and the rear camber were completely out of alignment. This alignment issue had worn the front tyres down to the casing, rendering the tyres unusable.

Between buying the car and finding these problems I had put about 600 miles on the car, indicating to me that the misalignment had been driven on for some time before they took the car in and then sold it to me.

I have attempted to contact the Cooper BMW Tunbridge Wells multiple times over the past month and have received absolutely nothing back from them.

Part of the reason I bought through the BMW Approved Used scheme was to avoid things like this. If such a basic issue was missed prior to selling me this car, I'm left wondering what other hidden issues it might have?

This Inchcape dealership was extremely quick to respond to my queries prior to purchase, but seemingly don't want to know now they have my money (I paid cash)."
2019-01-01,5,"Everything went according to plan, with a telephone call to let me know work had been completed and the car was ready for collection."
2019-01-01,1,"Service department is totally inept (sorry to say). I have given them the opportunity on 3 different occasions and every time I have been let down.

From shoddy workmanship (cover left off the gear box which is making noise and yet the BMW chap who delivered me driving 6 miles did not pick the noise up).

To woeful customer service (told to pick up the car while it is booked as collect & drop on one occasion and on another where told to pay for the invoice before car is delivered...even though invoice is paid for).

Catalogue of screw ups one after the other. Will avoid like a plague."
2019-01-01,5,Many thanks to Grant who was simply fantastic with product knowledge and such great service.
2019-01-01,5,Nathan ensured the complete service experience was seemless. I was very pleased I had chosen Reading to have the maintenance work done. Highly recommended.
2018-12-31,2,"Had to phone four times to get through, obviously lack of staff to deal with demand. Was passed from service desk to BMW Assistant to Alliance, lack of ownership of problem. Finally established fault was linked to a BMW recall. Once this was established experience improved but not what you’d expect from BMW. On a separate note requested a test drive from the same dealership Coopers Reading over a month ago and have heard nothing. My experience at other dealerships has been much better. Overall Coopers Reading could do better, much better."
2018-12-31,3,"Had my car MOT’d here they sent a video
advising what needed doing and requested authority to undertake the work which was good. When I got the car back all the warning lights came on about tyre pressure which were fine when I sent the car in. Also they hadn’t washed it which they told me they would as part of the service"
2018-12-31,5,Sam Patrick was extremely helpful and patient in answering all of our questions. He went away and did everything that we asked of him and more. We could not be happier with the service we have received to date and are enjoying the Defender enormously!
2018-12-31,5,Excellent fast service. Aimee was very friendly and welcoming.
2018-12-31,5,From when i dropped off the car to when i picked it up i couldn`t fault the service. they greeted me with a smile and an offer of a drink and promptly got on with the work. It didn`t take as long to do the work as suggested and called me as soon as the work was finished. Would highly recommend the after work customer care as well with the queries I had. Just to reiterate faultless.
2018-12-31,4,"We where very satisfied with the service that Ben provided, the only reason we didn't give 5 stars was ,I had to come back to pick up the flat tyre kit as it wasn't in the boot when we checked the next day ."
2018-12-31,5,The guys here were so incredibly helpful - a better service than I could have hoped for! I hate driving into garages etc but the courtesy was so appreciated! Thank you
2018-12-31,5,"great job done , after not having repairs done to my liking (not this car}at various garages ,,,i booked my Mercedes in at Inchcape north wales ..excellent service ,.very well pleased.."
2018-12-31,5,Southport Mercedes always provides excellent service & they are helpful & willing in terms of giving me better quotes. Their Service department is equally just as fantastic & very personable.
2018-12-31,5,"My oil service was a very good experience for my vw up. Bought a 2 yr service package, which was good value and the 1st service was great. Reception was friendly, I waited in a nice lounge area whilst the work was done, good coffee available as well as magazines. Car ready after 2hrs, the work done was explained and paperwork recieved. Also given a monitoring chip to put in the diagnostic port, links by Bluetooth to an app that gives useful information."

2018-12-30,5,"I very much appreciated the time that was taken to understand my needs. Recommendations were made, but without pressure being put on me. Staff were very well-informed and made themselves freely available to talk with me at my own pace. Excellent service.

2018-12-30,5,Excellent service by Dan in Thames Ditton Mini. He really made a the whole process feel personal and listening to our needs. Definitely would recommend this dealership
2018-12-30,5,"I took my car in for a replacement tyre after hitting a pothole. Whilst there, they completed a service that was booked for the following week, This saved me a second trip"
2018-12-30,3,Amazed that a £500 service was undertaken on a vogue Se and the Vallance had leaves in it when I inspected the engine bay.
2018-12-30,1,"Helpful sales exec (Pete), good spec car, very well prepared, and flexible in helping me to purchase from the other side of the country. Highly recommended.

** Update** after discovering a tyre put on the wrong way round (despite extensive BMW quality checks), and paying ATS myself to rectify, the tyre has been dangerously repaired. And sadly Cooper Tunbridge Wells, despite acknowledging this should not have happened, won’t reply to my comms and are ignoring the issue.

Beware their aftercare. Check everthing twice. As they are not interested once you’ve bought a car and find a problem that should have been picked up in their quality checks."
2018-12-29,5,"We bought our car this week at Inchcape Land Rover York. We received an excellent service from Jeremy Lovatt, one of their sales executives. He was great and very helpful. We are very happy and enjoying the new car. Also the showroom looks fantastic and very welcoming."
2018-12-29,5,Bought my car from this garage and live in Scotland .... very simple no hiccups
2018-12-29,5,"I bought my MB one week ago, in addition to the very good customer service and efficiency, I was amaze with after sale service and friendly calls from staff, Thank you Harriet and the team.

2018-12-29,1,"I left my car for a service and MOT at Inchcape VW Altrincham this week. I know nothing about routine things that need doing - I drop it off and I pick it up! My husband luckily does know and checks the reports before I agree to any work. 2 years ago, they said the brake fluid needed doing. Fair enough, paid for it to be done. Last year, I was advised the brake fluid needed doing when I came to collect it. I questioned it as I’d remembered being told it was every other year. ‘Yes well this is it’s second year so we advise it’s done’ it had been done 1 year and 1 week before! My brand new 1 day old tyres were also described as worn and would need to be replaced soon. I do less than 8k miles a year, of course they need replacing ?! Last time I was also advised I’d need a new cam belt with pump. I agreed as was told it had to be done every 5 years so the work was done by them, at Inchcape. Picked up the car and was luckily told it’s cheaper as I have a pump that actually never needs replacing. Great I thought. Fast forward to this year. With the cam belt being done less than 10 months before, you need a new cam belt! Priced with the pump over £500! We phoned and told them it had been done by them and asked what they were paying at? No one was available to take our call so would call us back. Got a ‘courtesy call’ from a mechanic to advise us there had been a mistake and the report we were sent contained the cam belt and it didn’t need doing after looking again. Apparently non the wiser to the call we had made to call them out on it! Twice in 2 years they have tried to do inrequired work one car, unrequired as they had already done the work themselves preciously! They also failed to know about their cars that the pump does not get replaced yet the price charged would indicate they didn’t know. I was also sent a price more for the cam belt than they were advertising in the branch for fixed price repairs! They also tried to charge me £25 as the locking wheel nut wasn’t in the boot. They lost it previously but wouldn’t admit it (they were the only ones who had ever been in there and suddenly it was gone) so I had to pay them to break the locking wheel nuts off my wheels! They want to replace the brake discs when the brake pads have never been replaced (again I don’t know anything about cars but was told this shouldn’t need doing this way around?) I know for a fact that if my husband hadn’t have been looking over each request, I’d have paid a lot more over the years for stuff that wasn’t needed!"
2018-12-28,5,Excellent reception and was attended to within a minute of arriving. Staff in attendance gave me a warm welcome and explained every step of the process. Eventually offered a courtesy car and was done within 10 minutes. Keep it up guys.
2018-12-28,1,"Inchcape VW Telford. Attempted to purchase second hand VW Up. Having vowed to never return to Inchcape VW following problems with them many years ago I stupidly thought their customer service may have improved and after some persuasion from a family member I agreed to give them a chance. Total waste of time. The sales rep did spend the time going through various possible vehicles online and I ordered a vehicle which I was told needed to be collected from Swindon. I asked how long it would take for the vehicle to be delivered as I was without a car and needed it for a work commitment in a couple of weeks time. I was told no more than a week for the vehicle to arrive and I would be kept updated. No updates were received and just under a week on I chased an update to be told it was hoped the car would be there in a couple of days. I waited the full week and heard nothing so I contacted the dealership. I was told the drivers hadn't been able to get to Swindon to collect the vehicle as they had been short staffed so it would take longer. I asked how long and reiterated my work commitment. I was told they did not know but hopefully it would be there the following day. More time passed and the car didn't show. When I chased subsequently I was told the vehicle needed some work to the bodywork (first I'd heard of it and didn't fill me with confidence!!) and they were doing this in Swindon so it would now depend on how quickly they could get this done. Ultimately I became so fed up with this lack of service that I went to Johnson's VW in Birmingham and they were fantastic! The customer service was excellent from start to finish. When I went to Inchcape Telford to ask for the return of my deposit I spoke with the manager. All he had to say was the drivers had been busy. He was sorry I wasn't happy with the service I had received but as I had purchased a car elsewhere there was nothing he could do. It was apparent he had no concern about customer relations, which seems to have been consistently low across the Inchcape brand for at least the last ten years. If you're looking to purchase a VW (new or used) my advice would be to avoid Inchcape VW and head to a different VW dealership, even if it means travelling a little further afield."
2018-12-24,5,"The whole process from start to finish was excellent! Paul was very efficient and went above and beyond to ensure I would have the right car for me before Christmas. I would highly reccomend Paul and Inchcape Land Rover Preston!
Thank you again."
2018-12-24,5,"Car had a recakk, from booking in to having work undertaken. First class service. Very impressed"
2018-12-24,5,"First class customer experience throughout. My circumstances were somewhat complicated as I was abroad but my neighbour handled all the early communications, with me completing the transaction last week. The sales agent, Stephen Drewitt, from the Southampton branch brought the vehicle up to Guildford and all the paperwork was done then and there. Due to a glitch on my part, I was unable to collect the vehicle until the following day but the whole Inchcape/Jaguar Landrover experience was completely seamless. Highly recommended."
2018-12-24,5,The whole experience of buying our new Mercedes was a pleasure from start to finish. Can highly recommend.
2018-12-23,5,"Great service as always, never been disappointed."
2018-12-23,5,"Staff extremely helpful and friendly from arrival for car service and MOT to picking car up even though they were short of staff due sickness Thanks to a great team,"
2018-12-22,5,Always a pleasure to bring my car to cooper bmw. Staff are emaculate & work to a visual high standard
2018-12-22,5,Eddy was excellent
2018-12-22,5,"The premises were clean, the service prompt and professional. I will happily use this company again."
2018-12-22,5,"Very helpful and informative, and pleasant with it too."
2018-12-21,3,I dropped my BMW 530i GT off at 8am prompt and was the first customer to be seen. I did think this would mean my car would be serviced first. However I had not heard anything from the garage by about 4pm so I rang them only to be told it should be ready by 5.30pm. Not impressed at all. If it was going to take that long I would have thought someone would have rung me throughout the day to tell me.
2018-12-21,5,Everything was first class from booking to leaving.
2018-12-21,4,Service booked then updated over the phone without any questions. Service completed as quoted. Very polite
2018-12-21,5,Can't rate the team here highly enough. The best customer service from any car dealership ever. Took car in for a recall and the whole experience from beggining to end was as easy and pain free as it could possibly have been. I'd give 6 stars if I could.
2018-12-21,5,"Coopers were helpful and efficient throughout the process, giving a lift in to town and keeping me informed of the issues throughout the service. It’s such a change-and a pleasure-to receive honest and personal service, and from comments by other clients in the service centre it was evident that they felt the same way.
It was a very different experience from an attempt to book a service with a dealer in north London who didn’t bother to call back and who later sent an email entitled Dear xxxx.
I’d be very happy to recommend Coopers of Ipswich."
2018-12-21,2,"As the Garage had all of the car's details, I assumed that I would be contacted to arrange the Service - No, I had to call, and was told that there was a six week wait. The call centre said that the Service would take one and a half hours, so I decided to wait for the service to be completed. When I arrived, the Service receptionist said that it would take 2 hours, including a wash - it was only there for an ""oil service""
Three and a quarter hours later, I was able to collect the car, without the wash. Nobody approached me to say that the job was delayed.
If I had known that it was going to take half a day, I would have arranged to be picked up and taken home.
Not impressed"
2018-12-21,2,Poor customer service experience at Stratstone dealership- a commitment was given to address an order for a light part and chrome frame in Spring this year and on the follow up visit this week -the missing chrome frame was forgotten again. Very expensive service price for poor customer service and lack of attention to detail - which you would not expect as a Mercedes customer.
2018-12-21,5,First time I have used Inchcape's Mercedes outlet at Cheshire Oaks and I must congratulate the service team. I will definitely be using them again for service. Friendly and efficient.
2018-12-21,5,"I had never thought of buying a mini before and had over the years bought many cars from different dealers but Cooper Norwich from the outset were a delight to deal with. When phoning the call was immediately answered and I was never kept waiting even if the person I wanted to speak to was not available. I never at all felt pressurised to purchase a Mini but was given all the information I needed to make the decision and once made, the car purchase was handled very professionally. Top marks to all and a big thank you to JT who was a delight to deal with. It’s a pity that other motor manufacturer salesman don’t pop in the Cooper Norwich to see how it should be done."
2018-12-21,2,"The car was booked in at 8am for a service and so we arrived at 7.55am in two vehicles so we could leave it and collect it later and could not gain access to the car park due to a car blocking the entrance which I assume was there overnight to prevent thefts. We therefore was left waiting on a busy dual carriageway at rush hour in two vehicles. We therefore went to service desk and was told to take a seat and wait, we therefore asked if they could move the car so we could park the vehicle off the main road, we were told somebody would come out and do that, 10 mins later we were still sat waiting so again we went back in and asked them to move the vehicle, eventually somebody came out and moved it. We left and requested that the vehicle would be ready for collection at 10am they took our phone number and therefore expected a call as to when the vehicles was ready which we never received. We returned at 10.15am to collect the vehicle which was blocked in by another car, yet again we were kept waiting for nearly 10 minutes for somebody to move it so we could leave.

I could see that the forecourt is very busy and packed and only a small site, but if the cars are booked in for a service at 8am and people are on site you would assume that the first thing they do is make clear access for customers to enter off a busy main road"
2018-12-21,5,Recent experience was good. Helpful staff and good service
2018-12-20,5,"I have received excellent service from all members of staff. They were all courteous, helpful, pleasant and polite at all times. The salesperson (James) was friendly, and helpful -talking me through each aspect of the purchase, ensuring I was fully aware of all options and explaining all the technicalities. The car was spotlessly clean and ready for me on the purchase day. I would recommend this dealership."
2018-12-20,5,Excellent sales service
2018-12-20,5,"Cooper Reading Review

Had a fantastic buying experience through Cooper Reading and particularly with Francis Reed.

My wife and I found Francis to be very genuine, honest and a great person to deal with. Am extremely happy with the car and the service provided."
2018-12-20,5,Immy was great!
2018-12-20,5,"A great experience, very supportive and nothing was too much trouble."
2018-12-20,2,"Having been asked be there by 8.30 I arrived at 8.15..told them I would walk around until work done..returned at 3.30..work not started..I went home..taxi from garage arrived 5.30 to take me back to garage to pick up car which was now finished.
very unhappy..this work was booked in back in late october.
why oh why doesnt the garage set the clock time when giving the car back to customer.Not at all happy with experience..on the positive side the vehicle was beautifully clean on return"
2018-12-20,5,"This was the first time I had cause to use the outlet. I arrived late for my car service due to an unfortunate flat tyre, but on arrival I was quickly sorted with the curtesy car. Even though I arrived late, the car was ready before I got back there. Needless to say, excellent service, I have no doubt I will use them again."
2018-12-20,5,"Excellent customer service. Thank you to Nick Jimson, an absolute pleasure to deal with."
2018-12-20,3,"When I arrived the lady at the service desk was on the phone. Five different male staff, looking very official, saw me waiting and not one asked if they could help! Just as well I was wanting a battery for a key fob and not a new BMW, otherwise I would have walked out. The lady at the service desk was very pleasant and helpful, when she came off the phone. Not the service I expect from BMW!"
2018-12-20,3,"Express service booked knowing it would take up to two hours to complete.
Arrived at reception 9.40am with car booked in for 9.45am express service.
Checked in with reception, took a seat, waited 35 minutes, then mentioned again with reception I had booked express, and was everything still OK.

Someone then saw me and took the car away for express service.

Got the car back at 12.43pm, so about three hours all in all, so had a knock on effect what I had planned that day.

Very nice new building though, friendly staff and lots of space for customer parking."
2018-12-20,5,We have received excellent service from Martin Pearce and the team at Jaguar in Derby.I would recommend this dealership and their team to anyone.We couldn’t have been looked after any better.
2018-12-20,5,Excellent sales people not pushy would recommend
2018-12-20,5,Quality service from start to finish. Answered all questions i had and provided reassurance on any items i was unsure of. Would definitely recommend.
2018-12-20,5,"Am always blown away by the excellent service & value for money I receive, yet again over and above that expected. I always feel in safe hands, so important for us women! ;)"
2018-12-20,3,"Visit at Cheshire Oakd garage yesterday. Long wait to collect car - fully understand that things don’t always go to plan and there was a problem getting the rubber off the wheel following a blow out, but it would have been a massive help if someone had rung me so I could come to collect the car later rather than sitting in the showroom for over an hour and a half with all my food shopping! Was also frutrated with trying to contact the garage last Thursday/ Friday after the blow out. On the Thursday tried to get through numerous times. Spoke to the parts dept. Left message for someone to ring back, when someone did ting back they needed to check that the tyre was in stock and said someone from C Oaks would ring back so I could book an appointment for the Friday. No-one rang back. Couldn’t get through Friday morning. Problem with phone lines apparently. On a positive note the tyre was replaced and it was good to get a nice clean car back afterwards."
2018-12-20,1,Purchased a Mini Countryman from mini bmw at Chelmsford. Weighing three weeks the at had to be returned for a fault. I was given a courtesy car by mini assist and told it was my responsibility to make sure the dealership extended the courtesy car if they needed to keep my one any longer than two days. After the two days I called the dealership three times in one day asking for someone to call me back Re my car and the courtesy car- I had no returned calls and in the end had to go back to mini assist. They extended the courtesy car for another two days and said they couldn’t do it anymore and tochase up the dealership. I phoned four more times over those two days- every time was told by Monica on reception they were busy and would call me back and low and behold not one returned phone call. I have not had one conversation with anyone regarding the status of my car apart from a voicemail on the first day it was in there to say it hadn’t been looked at yet!!! This car has cost over £27k with the added extras we added and I have been given a smaller car and have no idea how long I will be without my one! Due to my frustration my dad then called and tried to get an update speaking to a service manager called Michael. Amazing that after speaking to my not so happy father I suddenly got a call from Michael straight away who not only had no update for me but also was under the impression that his staff had been in contact with me! The place is a shambles and offers what the worst customer service I have ever had. They are eager to take your money and promote a fantastic after sales care at the time of purchasing and on their hold music when you call but it has been my experience that once you have left the dealership and have helped meet their targets any after care goes out the window. I am now paying over £350 a month for a car I haven’t got and with no word of when I will be getting it back. I would never buy from mini Chelmsford again or recommend them
2018-12-20,5,"Tunbridge Wells Audi always make one feel welcome, the prices are always fair and there are deals to be had if one takes advantage of the servicing packages on offer."
2018-12-20,5,"The service was very good all round. Very satisfied. Would certainly recommend this Mercedes Leicester dealership, particularly Simeon in sales."
2018-12-20,2,"Unfortunately have to give only 2 stars as I had specifically arranged to pick up the courtesy car for my service at 8am only to find the doors to the dealership shut, they only opened about 8:25, leaving me waiting outside.

Other than that the service was spot on."
2018-12-20,2,"Agreed a deal on a car at Inchcape Macclesfield despite being based in Leeds. Communications were good and had all my questions answered well. Unfortunately the condition of the car wasn’t as described and the one chip I’d been told about hasn’t been touched up as promised. And there were other chips and scratches I hadn’t been told about, stained upholstery, and a poor valet.

I walked away and wasted a morning."
2018-12-20,2,"Paid £60 to be told what I already knew from my local dealers diagnostic. They told me theirs would give a more detailed explanation however just told me I need to replace the turbo at a charge of £1400. Also booked in for a winter check and never received the items in the description, didn’t have time to argue my point and just left."
2018-12-20,5,"Standard of service was second to none,from the moment I pulled up to the service bay the meet and greet was exceptional ,
Truly outstanding service"
2018-12-20,5,Excellent customer service. Ben was very helpful and made the overall experience very easy and convenient.
2018-12-20,5,it was the first time I have dealings with Inchcape VW in colchester and wasn't sure what to expect. I have had dealings with other companies before and Inchape VW colchester has surpassed all expectations. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and I am very confident in using them again should the need arise. 5* for me. thank you very much Inchape VW colchester
2018-12-20,5,"After recently making a purchase from the Inchcape York - The new showroom was amazing, the staff from the lovely girls on reception to the sales man who was professional, helpful, not pushy, and could not do enough for us was brilliant. We have looked at numerous cars up and down the country in different showrooms and we as a family can definitely say that the experience was fantastic. Our sales man Luke needs a medal as been in Sales ourselves we have high standards he way exceeded these. Anna"
2018-12-19,5,My experience at Volkswagen Chester was 5 star treatment from all the staff when I took my car for a service so I would like to say thank you to everyone!
2018-12-19,4,"Nice customer service, nice hot drinks and hospitality on a very cold morning"
2018-12-19,5,The Stratford upon Avon dealership offered an outstanding level of Customer Service. From arrival we were courteously greeted & then introduced & allocated to our personal Service Adviser. We waited in a comfortable seating area with unlimited refreshments & then received an email with a detailed inventory of the work that had been carried out....both visual & with audio by our personal Technician. Couldn't fault the service & I realised that I'd never had service like that ever in the past with any other brand of vehicle. I felt yet more spoilt when they advised me that after they'd carried out a full health check on the vehicle they had also fully valeted it inside & out...so grateful as it was a really pleasant & helpful experience.
2018-12-19,5,"The whole experience was made very easy and pleasurable by your
friendly,helpful and knowledgable sales team. Thank you for an excellent service."
2018-12-19,5,Car service process went smoothly from initial booking to return after the workshop and valeting.

2018-12-19,5,Helpful and professional service
2018-12-19,5,"Exceptional service from all staff Professional, genuinely pleasant people.
My car was serviced, while I waited. It was cleaned inside and out, and l was given a written report on the condition of brakes, tyres etc.
My car is a 2005 XK8 so I also benefited from Jaguar's fixed price servicing on cars over thee years old - £255. !!"
2018-12-19,2,"Purchased an approved used Evoque from this dealership with some issues which I was told would be sorted out at no extra expense to myself after the purchase.
When I first looked at the car, the front tyre was flat. It was pumped up for the test drive and repaired before I picked it up after purchase.
Approx three weeks later it had again deflated and I took it back for repair. I was told there was nothing wrong with the tyre, it just needed reseating and new valve.
Another month passed and it kept deflating. I would pump it up but wasn’t able to take it back straight away because of work commitments. When I did take it back they told me the tyre was in such bad condition, it had to be replaced at a cost of £250. I didn’t believe it could be that bad and decided to take it to a tyre specialist with the thought it was just a case of resealing on a cleaned alloy rim. My thoughts turned out to be correct. The alloy was cleaned and the tyre re-seated. The guy that did the job said it would have been ridiculous to throw such a good tyre away.

The second issue was a internal boot cover, nothing that expensive but it was in the ad’s for the car and when I picked it up, it was missing. After about three months they finally agreed to provide it and gave me a brand new cover for which I am thankful. Just a shame it took so long and three visits to conclude this issue.

The third issue was that one of the black alloys had some corrosion on it that meant the black paint had flacked off near the back of the wheel. When I was in the dealership I mentioned it to the guy that sold me the car and he said they would sort it out at no cost when I next brought it in.
When I did take the car in I spoke with the service department and was told it would have to be dealt with by the sales side of the company as they agreed this repair. I then went to find the sales representative only to find he had been sacked a couple weeks previous. I didn’t get anything in writing for this which was my mistake and I now have no way to prove what was verbally agreed.
I guess I’ll need to fix this problem out of my own pocket and mark it up to lessons learnt.

Another issue has arisen whereby the car doesn’t unlock or lock from the door sensors when the car is wet. It’s an intermittent problem which I know from experience can be difficult to diagnose and resolve but as the car has a two year warranty, I thought it wise to book it in and get it checked out as electrical problems like this can be expensive.
The car was booked in and on arrival my wife was told that the diagnosis of the fault was chargeable. Nothing was found and as yet I haven’t received a bill for this diagnosis, but I’m confused as to why I should pay for work that’s covered under warranty. Maybe warranty means something different with this dealership.
My experience doesn’t seem to be unusual compared with friends and colleagues that deal with JLR, which is a shame as I enjoy the car but have reservations about keeping it or renewing with them in future."
2018-12-19,5,"I have nothing but good things to say about MINI Cooper Sunderland. I initially took a 48 hour test drive on a MINI Countryman, which was great. The car was superb, but the service I received by the team at Cooper Sunderland was outstanding. My circumstances with looking for a new car changed and I was able to get one much quicker than I anticipated - the sales rep I dealt with (from 48 hour test drive, to purchase) was great. He worked hard to find the right car for me, took time to explain everything in detail and gave a deal that was right for me. I would not hesitate to recommend Cooper Sunderland to anyone, they have been fantastic!"
2018-12-19,2,"Promised on phone that service would be max 3 hours. for that reason I decided to do shopping rather than arranging a lift home.
Dropped off at 11.30 as agreed and asked for it to be done as quickly as possible which I was assured of.
at 14.00 hours I turned up and was told it would be a further hour which was 30 mins more than max time. The car was eventually ready at 16.00 hours, 1.5 hours more than max time even though there were no issues with the vehicle. I was sitting around for 2 hours.
No issues with staff but the service levels and over promising and under delivering were just not acceptable."
2018-12-19,5,"The greeting was Freindly and Professional, all work carried out promptly, everything explained clearly and follow ups sent. All round excellent experience delivered by a great team of people."
2018-12-19,5,"I found Ollie very accommodating and helpful. The team did their best to make sure we were happy and that we got the car we wanted, when we wanted it by, at a price we were happy to pay."
2018-12-19,1,"had a recall for my bmw .. friendly staff as expected, but the actual info given on the work done and the so called 25 point check done on the car was poor to non existent, I am an engineer and could have handled any info they give me to decipher, but instead I had to ask and what i received was a hand typed description of the recall no 25 point check sheet,they also stated they updated my software, I have to say this is an all out lie , the origonal software has just been reset/installed, as they did not backup the software on the vehicle before disconecting the battery pure laziness (with no warning to me I might add as I am now having to us a scan tool to adjust parameters and restrictions that bmw apply to there cars and they remove for higher models )
considering they charge astronomical hourly rates to customers you would think they would have professional service to justify it ..
I would advise customers only to use for warranty faults as these will have no charge.

Disappointing Really

2018-12-19,5,"Had the M performance power upgrade fitted to my car, very good price for the kit and labour, was able to get car booked in within a few days of calling, just before Christmas.

Dropped the car off at 8.30am, they paid for a cab for me to go into the town and back whilst they carried out the work. And they did so within the timeframes they promised.

They also de-badged my car for free, which I was very happy about.

They offered to clean the car but weren't able to do it in the time, they did offer for me to wait and have it done but I needed to get going. They said I could pop in any time to get it done but I live far away so unlikely to take them up on that but the offer was appreciated.

Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.

All in all, very happy with the experience."
2018-12-18,2,"Inch cape Preston not very impressed with the service dept
My Range Rover due for a service notified them of faults and also required an MOT. Constantly phoned in the afternoon ,they just picked up the phone and cut me off . When I eventually got in touch they said it would be ready for collection at 530pm. I arrived and was told no issues took me to the vehicle and away I went home. The vehicle had not been set up properly miles in kilometres radio not set up reversing camera still disfunctional and no MOT.
£700 + for what I won’t be recommending them in the future BH"
2018-12-18,3,"Pleasant enough staff. Took time and effort to find a vehicle to suit my requirements. Car was a demo from another dealer in the group and although it was onsite at BMW Durham for over 2 days does not appear to have been touched when collected. Despite been only 6 month old and costing well over £30k It still had the scuffs, greasy fingerprints and marks and a scratch on the upholstery and interior trim some of which were visible on the website where it was first advertised (BMW Norwich).

After having problems getting my Alloy wheel repaired which still isn't repaired I phoned Mercedes Benz at Oxford Friday 14th December and they didn't have the curtesy to call me back. I Feel as though now you've got my money you can't be bothered with any aftercare to your customers. I wouldn't recommend anyone to use Mercedes Benz Oxford and will be going elsewhere to my servicing done."
2018-12-18,5,I could not fault the employees there who helped me to purchase my car. The whole experience was stress free and easy. My best experience with any dealership I have dealt with.
2018-12-18,5,"I feel very well, good service"
2018-12-18,5,Did the job as required and promptly. No complaints
2018-12-18,5,"Nice people to do business with. Helpful with the myriad options on Mini & keen to do business.
With so much tech to explain on a new car, the handover should be specified as a (say) 2 hour slot. with the process a bit slower and preferably indoor. Handover was thorough & comprehensive no issue there, just felt a bit rushed."
2018-12-18,5,"Really pleasant experience from start to finish.

The staff were really helpful and polite. Never once did I feel pressured or pushed to make a decision."
2018-12-18,5,Excellent service
2018-12-18,5,Customer service in the service department was excellent. First time I have visited the dealership and was well impressed. Keep up the good work.
2018-12-18,5,Jaz took a lot of trouble to ensue that we were selecting the right car and accessories for our needs. There was no pressure or hurry in coming to our decision. With the car now delivered we are delighted with our choice and look forward to many miles of happy motoring
2018-12-18,5,superb customer service from extremely pleasant and knowledgeable people.
2018-12-18,5,All very polite and professional.
2018-12-18,3,"Had to wait 3 hours on a service which was booked in for 11:30 and was told I could wait and it would be done in an hour
When I returned after 3hours was told it would be 15more mins then had to wait a further 30 mins and missed picking my son up from school
Was not great service !"
2018-12-18,5,"Brilliant all the work done efficiently , car was valeted and the courtesy car was clean brand new.
Kept me informed at all times, they do get busy which speaks for itself so book ahead.

2018-12-18,5,Excellent service
2018-12-18,3,"Shame there's no service desk in Basingstoke. It means the start and end of your time at Toyota is frustrating - you can see people behind a large glass wall but they don't seem to see you.
It seems to take a long time to get out and away even after you've been told the car is ready.
I was promised a car wash but this wasn't done."
2018-12-18,5,Excellent service and unbeatable offers!
2018-12-18,1,"terrible service. first time they had my car for a day and then found they didnt have the part (having known what was neeed). second time (this week) had car for a day, work not done even though told to pick up at 5:30, finally got the car back after 6. poor service, terrible communication. terrible planning. awful team."
2018-12-18,5,"Mini Dealers at Durham are Fantastic.. sorted me a new car within 1 week, friendly and great service. I love my Cooper Sport."
2018-12-18,5,"James (the sales rep) was excellent from start to finish. He was very patient whilst we decided upon which car we wanted to buy and was very helpful in answering all of our questions.
We were very pleased with the service we received and we are very happy with our new car."
2018-12-18,1,"How Mercedes / Jaguar let Inchcape sell their vehicles is beyond me.
Customer service is atrocious as soon as they have your money. The car I bought had been badly repaired after an accident which not only did they not disclose but then tried to ignore. Unless you're buying a new car over £80k forget about Inchcape. I had warning lights and severe vibration 10 mins after leaving the dealership in a 2016 Mercedes, wasn't even offered a test drive which should have set the alarm bells ringing. The friendly staff and well presented dealerships are a front to cover absolute greed and disregard for customers."
2018-12-17,5,Peter the Service Advisor was excellent. He called me kept me informed all every step of the way. The Video from the mechanic was a nice touch. Thanks Guys.
2018-12-17,5,"Friendly and very helpful , thanks"
2018-12-17,5,"Took my car for service on Saturday 15th Dec. Had already told inchcape i would wait for the car and not require a courtesy car, my wife and myself were offered drinks and biscuits, saw car being taken it to the workshop and just over an hr later the car was ready for me, washed and vacuumed, first class service , would definitely recommend."
2018-12-17,5,"There was a longstanding problem with a car we bought from Mercedes Benz( Inchcape ), in Warrington. The car was sold with confidence, as one would expect by Kirsty Williamson who was a first class Sales Executive just over 3 years ago. At first everything was fine and a great car. I will not bore readers with the details, but we put up with the problems that started until we got to the stage when a long existing problem could not be fixed, and we reached breaking point.
I had taken the car in so many times that I had to make a point and try and get the matter finalised and TRY AND GET the car replaced.

After many past visits, in October This year while the car was in for repair for the same problem for nearly a week, I called to chat to the General Manager Rebecca Sides and when she returned my call about the problem I explained in detail about our frustrations. I suggested that she took a look at the amount of times it had been in the Dealership and its history for that same repair, but I think she already was familiar with the details!
Rebecca said ""WE NEED TO GET YOU OUT OF THAT CAR AND INTO ANOTHER CAR, WITH A DEAL THAT IS ACCEPTABLE' so I left it with Rebecca as she suggested.

About 10 minutes later Calum Dunbar a Sales Executive called me to ask me to go in and discuss a Deal that was acceptable to both parties due to the problems.Calum was extremely helpful from the onset.

On meeting Calum he was extremely friendly and approachable and we discussed the options of which Class of vehicles may be of interest. I told him what we expected, so Calum told me that a vehicle that matched our requirements was available! It seemed too good to be true, but Calum said he would bring the vehicle so I could see for myself.

We got into the car and I took it for a test drive, and I was very impressed with the handling and vehicle road holding along with ALL driving aspects, driver view, automatic handling and comfort. When we returned Calum explained the operations of the dashboard, and was very explicit! I was very IMPRESSED! Calum had so much product knowledge and explained everything.

Next was my concern if MY WIFE was going to like the car, as she was not present. Calum told me she can test the car whenever. Next was the DEAL, which we went inside to discuss. I put my cards on the table once again about what was expected due to the financial costs and the faults of the previous car. We got to a deal that was suitable and agreed in principle, subject to my wife's approval. She would be the MAIN driver after all!

My wife came in to take a test drive and was impressed with the car so the deal was done. We collected the vehicle at the end of October, and ALL was finalised. I was very impressed with way Calum handled this situation.

There were more EXCELLENT and PERSONAL parts of the final deal which were completed, so things went well with an EXCELLENT RESULT.

In addition I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR SINCERE THANKS TO REBECCA SIDES, CALUM DUNBAR AND THE RECEPTION LADIES, SYLVIE, BEV, JACKIE AND LOUISE! The reception each and every time I have been to the Dealership is faultless. Just to finalise, I was delighted to see that Andrea Etchells in service had returned to the Dealership! Her attitude and manner historically to me has also excelled.

IT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO LEAVE A POSITIVE REVIEW, THANKS TEAM!
REBECCA AND TEAM,HAVE A GREAT CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR AND ALL THE BEST FOR A SUCCESSFUL 2019, KINDEST REGARDS, BRIAN AND CHERALYN WATT!"
2018-12-17,5,"Jack, my service advisor at Exeter VW Inchcape branch, was absolutely brilliant arranging my Golf’s full service, liaising with the technician and feeding back to me. Great service"
2018-12-17,5,"Thanks to Simon for a great purchase experience at Tonbridge Cooper, extremely helpful and professional, which helped make our car purchase a pleasure.
We highly recommend."
2018-12-17,5,"The whole process of buying my new car was exceptionally easy and painless. I test drove a car close to home, and agreed a deal for my car over the telephone. I even got a competitive part exchange based on milage, age and honest condition of my trade-in.
Not much of a gamble when dealing with a main Mercedes dealership. On the day I collected my car I drove the 150 miles to the showroom and drove away in my new car very happy."
2018-12-17,5,Excellent after sales costumer care.
2018-12-17,5,The lady who looked after me was so polite and helpful. The courtesy car was great and I wasn't landed with any unexpected charges.
2018-12-17,5,Very good service from Andrew at Coopers York
2018-12-17,5,"Overall the experience was very smooth. Everything delivered on time and communication was good. The garage took the car early and held it for me until I could take delivery. I appreciate this may have affected month end numbers so this was appreciated.
Peter is a good guy and once the deal was signed was very keen to ensure a smooth transaction.
One piece of feedback to help with future customers.... this particular bmw garage does have a bad reputation amongst people I know. It has been commented that people feel like the reps think it’s a chore to show you round or take you for a test drive. Whilst Peter was very polite and extremely professional during the enquiry phase and test drive, I did feel that for a premium brand my experience was lacking something, and I did to an extent feel like it was a chore taking me out. I don’t for a minute suggest peter was anything but professional - I think this is probably due to the number of time wasters that come in and kick the tyres, want to take a car for a thrash and then never come back. The point is, you will never know who is genuine or not, so to make the genuine ones feel special you have to hedge your bets and treat everyone as if they’re special. This will take the experience from being good to one that’s great. So I’m giving five stars because peter himself is a good guy, but please take this feedback on board and perhaps it’ll help the whole garage!"
2018-12-17,5,"We were welcomed in a friendly manner, and our sales contact Leonni has been a pleasure to deal with. We have concluded a deal that works well for both parties, and we have been made to feel that future relationships will be professional and friendly."
2018-12-17,3,"I booked my car in for 09.30 but was told that there will be a two hour delay as they were busy. So I spent 3 hours of my life there that I won't get back.
Having said that, everyone was very helpful (especially Mica) and all seemed very concerned. It's just a shame that someone couldn't have phoned me the day before so as I could have come in later.

Don Sharp"
2018-12-17,5,"This was the best handover of a new car I’ve experienced.
From the first email asking about a car Simon and Tim Watson have been excellent.

On Friday 14/12/18 Tim handled everything personally and his relaxed style was a pleasure.

I can’t speak highly enough and I’ve owned Mercedes, BMW, Audi etc.

I will be back"
2018-12-17,5,Good job happy with it

Many thanks

2018-12-17,5,Took my car in with a slow puncture they found the cause quickly & managed to do it all within 1 hour. Very friendly helpful staff
2018-12-17,5,Truly professional in every way. Reccomended.
2018-12-17,2,"I booked my M240i’s first service online at Cooper BMW Thames Ditton. Following the recommendations for an oil change, micro filter, and spark plugs change and systems check, the total cost came to £720. A day before my service was due, I checked the costs for the same work at other BMW dealers. To my surprise, the price fluctuated by as much as £70 within a 20 mile radius. I hadn’t chosen the cheapest but it wasn’t the most expensive. Regionally I’ll accept a small difference but not locally!

I had booked a Fast Lane Service but I couldn’t find any info online what this was. I was sent an email confirmation with the booking appointment time of 0915 despite selecting 0830. I arrived at 0830, gave my name at reception and was told to wait in the seated area. I waited for 30mins until someone came to take my key for a reading. I was also told I only needed the oil and oil filter change, contrary to what the website advised. Good that the cost was then reduced but the information was contradictory.

I asked how long the work would take as I could either take a taxi home, or stay and connect my PC to the WiFi. I was advised 90mins but could take another 15mins as I had a recall (small “blower wiring loom” exchange). I decided to stay. After 90mins I took a walk outside and saw my car was in the same parking spot...looked like they hadn’t even started. I waited to speak to someone but staff were scarce. After two hours the service advisor came over and told me he would get me an update and walked off. It was now 12 noon, after another hour and a half I was still waiting for the update. It wasn’t until ~1220 a different member of the service team came to tell me the work was complete and I could take the car. No word of apology or explanation as to why the estimated 90mins turned into nearly 3.5hours, 4 hours if you include the 30mins I was initially waiting for.

Bottom line is, I didn’t mind how long it was going to take, but wanted to know so I could either leave or stay. I understand times overrun but if they do, I expect an update in a timely manner and acknowledgment of any delays. I felt the whole experience was poor and not what I expected from BMW."
2018-12-17,5,"Excellent customer service and workmanship, very professional throughout, I highly recommend the Cooper team."
2018-12-16,5,"Managed to sort me a great deal on a new Mini, (better than Mini's official corporate discount which apparently can't be beaten!). Service was amazing throughout and helped me not only keep the car a secret for my wife's 40th but also went the extra mile to help me surprise her. Can't recommend highly enough!"
2018-12-16,3,"Booked in for recall as a waiting appointment, told it would take 1.5-2 hours. After 3 hours the car was ready but had not been cleaned as promised. I could not wait any longer as had another appointment which I had already delayed by 1.5 hours.
As the car was only booked in for a recall why was a long list of things ‘wrong’ with it printed off? Perhaps this is why it took so long. The car had recently passed its mot"
2018-12-16,5,Good service did for me extra stuff free of charge. Thanks BMW. Recommend it.
2018-12-16,5,Great service as usual... thanks for the free valet.. nice touch
2018-12-15,5,"Alan Wood looked after me @ Inchcape Preston He was very professional & helpfull. Nothing was too much bother - he even delivered my Discovery Sport to Holyhead.
A pleasure to deal with.

2018-12-15,5,"I took my car in for it's MOT/service and from the moment I stepped into the service department I was greeted by friendly and welcoming staff members. George in the service department was very helpful and professional, he explained what type of service my car was in for when I dropped it off and again talked me through the service it had undergone and it's MOT (which passed) when I collected it. All in all a positive experience and one that I hope will continue in the future!"
2018-12-15,4,"I am sure the first service for my car was done efficiently. The car was certainly very clean when I recovered it. However, my personal seat and steering wheel settings had been changed and the interior lights do not come on when the door is opened. To someone used to working with these things every day I am sure these are trifling matters but to someone who never looks at the manual they are an inconvenience I could do without."
2018-12-15,5,"I saw a car on autotrader and after discussions with Inchcape Crawley on the phone decided it was good enough to warrant a look. They were very honest about the condition and offered to touch up some paint chips. After taking a refundable deposit, they arranged for it to be delivered to one of their dealerships in the midlands, closer to me, so that I could view it. On inspection the front brake pads were quite worn and they agreed to replace them. The purchase was very straightforward and completed quickly. Overall a good experience and a very reasonable price."
2018-12-15,5,"We purchased a brand new A Class AMG Line with Executive Pack which is a very difficult car to source at present due to stock availability. Not only did Allan, Ian and Samuel offer the most competitive package to secure the business, they also sourced a car for immediate delivery before Christmas which was exemplary. Five star rating for the whole experience including the professional handover by Allan, the day after the car arrived to ensure total customer satisfaction!"
2018-12-15,5,"Booked car in for service at Lexus Derby - very quick and easy booking service and received immediate text confirming details.
Very friendly and prompt service from Olivia both on arrival and collection. Received a video explaining what had been done on the service and reassuring me that all was well. Received text advising it was ready for collection. Excellent customer service throughout as well as free coffee and biscuits provided!

Thank you for the excellent service."
2018-12-15,1,"I initially booked for 10/12 and was advised that they would confirm the cost to me. This never happened. I then phoned to change my date and asked for the cost. This was approximately £200, so I confirmed. On arrival I was advised it was over £300, I explained the phone call, they went away and suddenly it was £201! Wow that's a big difference, or the original was a rip off!
I left my car and waited, I got an email about certain works at 11:35 to which I responded within 5 minutes. At 13:55 I got a phone call asking me if I had received the email an what work I wanted doing. I found that odd as I received an email confirming my response, the service person said they had not received it, odd that the confirmation came from her.
At 15:37 I got a call that my car was ready, I arrived at 16:20 checked at reception and advised to take a seat and I would be seen. After 15 minutes and no acknowledgment I return to reception and asked what was happening, he advised me that he had called twice, but still nobody had seen me. I returned to the service area, after another 5 minutes, after seeing 2 others customers, who arrived after me, being dealt with, I returned to reception and asked what was going on! They said I couldn't be found, odd that as I never moved and my name was never called. I was finally seen after 25 minutes, no real apology.
It's my first Mercedes and for Mercedes appointed dealer I found this service appalling and not what I would have expected from Mercedes."
2018-12-14,4,Very professional approach.
2018-12-14,1,"I visited Land rover Southampton with a view of buying a used Range Rover, the price was just under £44,000 I made it VERY clear to the salesman that I would be looking to purchase that car for around £37,000. At no point was I informed that that would not happen. The following day I returned to discuss the cost of my PX, I was offered less than 50% of it's true value, I informed the salesman of this & the fact that I felt quiet insulted by this price & left. That afternoon I got my px valued by a well know car site that advertises on national tv & claims to gives you less than everyone else, but even they offered me double of what Land Rover Southampton had! I contacted Land Rover Southampton again to inform them of this & it was agreed that they would pick me up from the other company should I do the deal. I then returned again to finalise the price of the car I was wanting to buy (this was the fourth day in a row that I had dealings with the dealership & everyday I explained where I was expecting the price to be), at this point they informed me that the maximum they would give me off the car would be £190.
I appreciate that I was after a big ask & I didn't really expect to achieve it for this price, but I was willing to haggle to see what discount I could get.
There was no movement at all, I explained that I felt annoyed that they had wasted my time & they should have been more honest from the start rather than stringing me along & insulting me with ridiculous px prices.
Overall a very very poor customer service experience."
2018-12-14,5,I was very happy with the service I received from this company. They kept me informed at every stage and delivered my car in prestine condition. I would highly recommend them.
2018-12-14,5,I had a great experience with Maxine and look to keep the relationship with cooper bmw for many years now. Maxine has worked hard to find me the right car and I am over the moon with the choice
2018-12-14,5,Had to replace my car recently. As it was a Mercedes I naturally went there first but the salesman barely seemed interested. I haven't had a BMW before but I thought I would give them a try to see what sort of offer they could come up with. The salesman that dealt with me was excellent. It took a while to finally agree on a specification but he was always willing to accommodate me. I had received an offer from one of the well know car purchasing websites and Cooper BMW (Inchcape) managed to match it. They kept me well informed about delivery and set aside time to hand over the new car. They have since followed up with a telephone call and emails to make sure that everything is OK. Very impressed.
2018-12-14,5,My car was booked in for a B service at Mercedes Benz Stratford. There was no delay getting the car booked in and the staff were helpful and efficient. The car was ready in less than 2 hours and had been given a complimentary wash and vacuum. All in all a very good service.
2018-12-14,5,"After experiencing Liverpool Mercedes Benz this time I gave Ellsmere Port , a go . 100 times better than Liverpool professional , polite and clean I even received an video clip of my cars inspection More on par with the treatment I received from BMW"
2018-12-14,5,I recently purchased a used A5 from this company. The service was exceptional with nothing being to much trouble. Special thanks to James who never made me feel rushed and took the time to fully allow me to test the Vehicle and explore my options. 100% will return when the time comes for a change.
2018-12-14,5,Very professional. No problems.
2018-12-14,5,Customer friendly with excellent and reliable service and technical staff.
2018-12-14,1,"I booked a waiting appointment for 9.15am to have all four disc pads replace and the front two break discs. After being there for about 30 minutes I was told they had discovered they did not have the ruined disk sensors in stock but if I was prepared to wait they would have them by 11,30am so I agreed to wait rather have to make a second visit. At around 12,30pm being fairly sure they would be finished I enquire if my car was ready and was advised it was and was just going to to be washed which would take about a further 10 minutes. After a further 30 minutes I enquired again and was told it will be just another 10 minutes, on two further occasions I was told it would be another 10 minutes. When it had not appeared after 1.00pm I told the receptionist that I wished to speak to the Service Manger and she made an enquiry and said he would not be available half an hour so I asked to speak to the General Manger and after some 10 minutes a lady asked me if she could help, her exlplantion for the delay was that the car cleaners were a sub contractor and very slow to which I asked why then do the staff repeatedly tel customers that the car will be ready in 10 minutes.
Also, when a car is booked in for a specific item of service surely some one should be responsible for ensuring that any spare parts required are in stock.
The current level of service being provided by Coopers of Croydon is well below that which one expects from BMW and in my view they are currently dragging BMW's name through the mud."
2018-12-14,5,"Extremely efficient and courteous. Was sent a video of safety check - tyres, brakes, suspension etc. Loan car was an almost new 5 series. My service was completed by 3pm after a 10am drop-off.
Can't comment on cost as I have a service contract so no charge.
Also spoke to one of the sales team - no hard sell, good product and tech knowledge. All very good and highly recommended."
2018-12-14,1,"Repair work I was advised would take 90 mins max took close to 3 hours.
Branch takes no consideration for customers time at all. Despite multiple outbursts of 2 other upset customers no one from the branch took charge nor communicated what caused this complete breakdown in customer service."
2018-12-14,3,"Unfortunately, there was a mix up with my MOT booking. I arrived well before 08:00 expecting to wait for this to be done in an hour or so, then head to work. This was based on the call I'd made when booking in. I'd been mis-informed, the workshop doesn't open until 08:30 and it can take up to 2 1/2 hours to cover off all the work. Ellie was looking after me and, after speaking to a quite grumpy looking manager several times, I was offered a car so could drive to work and leave mine for the work to be done. I had to take time off work to drive back in the afternoon and got my car back about 14:00. Good recovery, but I did have to take time off work to drive back and forward and the manager's face made me feel like I was at fault!"
2018-12-14,5,good service friendly girls on service reception
2018-12-14,2,Took car in as an emergency with an engine error message. Was initially told nobody was available to look at it the same day. I had no other transport and the garage had no courtesy cars. Had to push and a mechanic looked at it within 30 minutes. I cant say the service exceeded my expectations.
2018-12-14,2,"I drove straight to Inchcape in Eastleigh when I had a problem with my Freelander on the motorway. Lovely space & a lovely Receptionist & I was seen within minutes of walking in. The process then took some time but it was agreed that they would take a look at my vehicle & see what the Diagnostic read out said. I left the dealership and got a call to say it was inconclusive and that they needed to do more investigation which would cost a total of £220 + VAT (including the £80 I had paid for the diagnostic check). I decided not to do this and to return it to the garage who had worked on it a couple of days before (all recent work had been explained to Landrover). I didn't make it home and had to call out the RAC who simply cleared the error messages showing on their Diagnostic machine and sent me on my way. So shame on you Landrover, feels like just looking to make money. (December 2018)"
2018-12-14,4,"Easy to book in for a service online and on the day drove straight in to a service bay. My car was in for a 4 year or 40,000 mile service and I had booked a 'while you wait' service. On the day of the service I was advised that it would take 3 hours to complete. Decent facilities for waiting - WiFi, Coffee, Mags, TV, etc.
Handed car over at 8.10am and drove out of the dealership at 1pm - nearer to 5 hours than three. No explanation for the delay and it would've been better to get a realistic estimate of time up front."
2018-12-14,5,Fantastic servce and support. Always very well looked after.
2018-12-14,5,"From arriving to leaving this was a great experience at the new facility. A modern dry arrival greeting was great, no waiting in the cold, and drive straight into the arrival lounge!

2018-12-14,5,"Went to have my new A1 checked out after the car started reporting a fault. This was a warranty claim, so I was expecting a bit of reluctance from the dealership since I did not buy my car here.

I was treated in the best way possible, the car was checked out quickly, the issue (which was pretty small) was resolved in no time. I was offered a complementary wash and inside cleaning. It was a perfect service, the staff was really nice. Piotr was the one assigned to my case and was really friendly and explained everything. In short : Swindon Audi is a dealer you can trust."

2018-12-13,5,"Good service, excellent trouble free hybrid motoring, feel very reassured that they care for our cars and us in a knowledgeable and professional way."
2018-12-13,5,"I initially dropped into the showroom ten minutes before they were due to close one Sunday afternoon. I was most impressed how the guy I spoke to , James Alexander, made the time for me to sit down and discuss with me what I was looking to do despite the fact he was due to go home imminently.

I left the showroom that evening certain that if I was going to buy a car it would be from James as I appreciated the fact he had made time for me.
I did subsequently purchase a car from him and was thoroughly impressed with the whole experience, which was in stark contrast to the experience I had from the VW garage that i had previously dealt with."
2018-12-13,5,great service staff and can work while you wait.
2018-12-13,5,"I have been dealing with the Derby Branch for a couple of weeks for certain issues about my vehicle. One telephone call and all was sorted. I would like to thank Lisa on the service desk for her customer service. I teach this subject and I will certainly be mentioning her too my students in how she handled my problem. I would also like to personally thank the Customer Services manager,Adam for genuinely listened to my side of the story and we came to a win-win situation. Some mistakes were made by Jaguar but soon rectified by a great team. The 5 stars is for the last 12 months that I have dealt with you. Well done. Brilliant service."
2018-12-13,4,"Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, more so than my normal local Audi dealer.

The problem was fixed but its Audi so the price was much more than I could have got this fixed with my local VW/Porsche specialist garage, but they fitted me in at short notice so that is appreciated."
2018-12-13,5,"From booking my car in for this service by telephone, to collecting it at the end of its service, every aspect of what Inchcape at Swindon provided was done so professionally and efficiently. The communication on the the day was also faultless."
2018-12-13,1,I was sold a 12 plate VW Polo with a price of £7500 at Inchcape Exeter. The salesman added in hidden extras eg GardX which cost nearly £400 for some expensive wax! When challenged what this was the reply was “I'm doing you a deal as its nearing the end of the month” Obviously trying to reach the monthly sales target. They skewed the numbers by taking £500 off my deposit and putting it towards a ‘supplementary’ invoice with the hidden extras. Will not be using Inchcape Exeter again. Appalling service!
2018-12-13,5,"A fab service from start to finish! Excellent customer service from the team at Mini and special thanks to Charlie for his advice, patience and customer care. From my initial “browsing” Charlie helped determine which car would suit my needs best, and then arranged for me to test drive the vehicle which was hugely beneficial. Once ordered Mini kept in touch with me at each stage via email, which was a really nice touch and helped build the excitement for when I collected the vehicle! My car arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected which was a lovely surprise and Charlie’s service provided a smooth and easy collection process! I highly recommend Mini in Banstead - thank you to Charlie and the team!"
2018-12-13,5,"Friendly and helpful when booking car in for preferred day.
On taking car to you the receptionist was a pleasure, even at 08.15! The job was done quickly and I received message car was good to go. Thank you BMW Malton."
2018-12-12,3,"a number of errors in customer service, communications and after sales and a problem with the vehicle that they had missed caused problems and delays, but they made amends and made a fair resolution. Later a failure to complete financial transactions caused further issues. The senior sales team were very good in sorting the problems out,"
2018-12-12,5,Coopers are always helpful try to accommodate and deliver on time.
2018-12-12,5,Efficient and helpful experience. An excellent service.
2018-12-12,5,"Exceptional service from the minute we entered the building.
My car was due for renewal at another company, after being unsure, I went to visit BMW. From the moment we stepped into the building we were greeted by Georgina we made us feel completely welcome and did not pressure me into any decisions. After a test dive and discussing figures everything was so simple and flawless. Achieving a sale couldn’t have been easier because the service was wonderful. Upon collection of the car, the handover experience was fabulous, making every moment feel completely exclusive. It felt like Christmas morning seeing my new car all shiny and waiting.
Couldn’t thank the staff at BMW Cooper Teesside, brilliant!"
2018-12-12,5,Very good service. Staff very polite. Thank you.
2018-12-12,5,Car was ordered 2nd September and handover completed 11th November. The Sales Executive kept us in the loop especially once the car had arrived on UK soil. This was our first foray into Jaguar and we have not been disappointed.
2018-12-12,5,"I can’t fault the service provided by Harry griffin, absolute cracking lad and the most easiest stress free purchase I’ve made! Top marks with Harry and the Tetbury Audi team"
2018-12-12,5,"Superb customer service provided by my sales representative Adam. The used car I purchased was presented to me on time and at a competitive price.
Overall the experience was stress free, enjoyable and would recommend Cooper BMW to friends and family."
2018-12-12,5,"Attended Cooper Mini workshop on Teesside. Instead of leaving the car, on this occasion I had to wait for it. They provided an efficient, friendly and professional service and returned the car, washed and cleaned, earlier than I expected."
2018-12-12,2,"Awful experience. We were advised that the service we booked would last 90 minutes and would cost £153. We returned to BMW Mini Thames Ditton after the advsed 90 minutes to find a very chaotic waiting area with initially no one to advise us about the status of my car. There were other customers in a similar situation. Eventually, we were told that the car was nearly ready and would be delivered outside for us in 15 minutes. One and a half hours later, we were still waiting. We were then told by a rather harassed employee that there seemed to be an issue with the price quoted to us for the service. The paperwork that had been produced was saying that the service would cost £250. We refused to pay this as it was not the original quote we were given, and asked to speak with a manager about this and about the unacceptable wait. We were told by the harassed employee that there were no managers at all in the dealership and that they were very short staffed. We refused again to pay the increased cost and demanded that the paperwork was brought to us immediately so that we could pay the original quotation and leave. Eventually this happened but, up until this point we had not been apologised to for neither the long wait or the issue with the cost. This staggeringly poor customer service was made all the worse by the lack of information throughout the process and the fact that the employee seemed ill equipped to deal with our complaints nor to effectively manage our expectations about the delay in the return of our car. It is unlikely we will ever use this place for work on our car again."
2018-12-12,5,As always excellent service and always made welcome.
2018-12-12,5,Excelent service as always
2018-12-12,5,"Once again EXCELLENT service from Cooper Teesside in regards to swift and efficient knowledgeable care and attention with 2 of our Family cars
Front of house staff are a Credit to the company"
2018-12-12,5,Good service staff very helpful
2018-12-12,3,"C Class in for 4th service with a courtesy car given. The courtesy car was dirty inside, no fuel in and no sat nav and I had specified sat nav when it was booked via the call centre many weeks ago. I was told on site that because the SD cards for sat nav's are ""being stolen"" the management decided to not install them but I wasn't told this until I was in the dealership and in a hurry to go. Additionally, when my car was booked in for its last pre-paid and planned service I mentioned it needed a sat nav update. On arrival I was told it was a charge of £99 as my car was out of the 3 year warranty period. Again nothing was mentioned when it was booked in. Very poor communication that appears to have been since the service booking facility was diverted to a Nottingham call centre rather than at the Derby dealer."
2018-12-12,5,"Their care, concern and speed was exceptional in relation to a car breakdown and in dealing with me - a complete stranger in their city."
2018-12-12,4,I am always nervous about car dealerships but I had little to complain about when I used an Inchscape company (H A Fox) 13 years ago - yes that was the last time I bought a new car. This time it was a late 2nd hand deal I was after and they came up with what I wanted. Service was professional and friendly and they were prepared to negotiate. They were also patient with the delays I encountered. My only gripe (but I don't blame them) was a reluctance to take my old bus in PX. Altogether a good experience. Now lets see what after-sales is like.
2018-12-12,5,"Very happy with the service I received with the sales team after recently buying my countryman.
Would definitely recommend"
2018-12-12,5,"Car buying made easy, many thanks"
2018-12-11,5,Great service Dean at Inchcape Norwich.Thankyou for all your help from phonecall to problem solved
2018-12-11,5,"Rob at Landrover Inchcape was very helpful, My vehicle was booked in and work completed in good time as promised."
2018-12-11,5,"My wife and I have used Coopers Reading to buy cars and have them serviced for 15 years, and they continue to offer a great service. Took my 9 Year old series 3 BMW for a safety recall, which was completed, but also got a health check and a stop start fault repaired. Thoroughly recommend this place."
2018-12-11,4,"The tyres were fixed ok, but as the car was new to me, when the tyre pressure light came on I took it back to the garage, twice. Both times I was assured there was no problem. So the fact that I had two slow punctures is a bit worrying...."
2018-12-11,5,Very efficient service and polite staff.
2018-12-11,4,"For the most part, the usual efficient service. The only reason I have not given 5 stars is because on this occasion I waited in the show room whilst my car was serviced. I was advised it would be ""about an hour"" but after 3hrs waiting with no proactive information or update forthcoming, I enquired as to the status of my vehicle.
It was at this point that I was then advised that it was ready and to ""take a seat"". Whilst I appreciate that timings are for the most part estimates and subject to change, it would have been good to get some kind of update once timing significantly over ran that which had been indicated to me?"
2018-12-11,4,"Pleasant staff, comfortable waiting area, work done explained, very good experience."
2018-12-11,1,They promise non existent courtesy cars. Let you know about changes at the last minute. And then don't do a through job. But at least you get a free car wash and clean. Oh wait no they don't even mange to do that in my case. However they are very polite. Great if you want to waste lots of your time and getting angry.
2018-12-11,4,"Collected and delivered my car to deal with a recall issue.
All good but was a little surprised that they no longer vacuum and wash car after recall work."
2018-12-11,5,"Great customer service, even after the roof collapsed ! this was my first visit to Audi Tunbridge Wells, it far surpassed other Audi dealerships I have experienced, well done Inchcape Audi"
2018-12-11,2,"Whilst the initial dealings were very positive, once 'the deal was done' the whole attitude changed.

There were no follow calls up to keep me informed as to the status of my new vehicle order unless I called to ask. In fact even getting a firm delivery date proved challenging and only happened when constantly pushed. Even then, my car was a day late arriving (during which i was told we dont actually know where it is - it should have arrived this morning) which i was only told 10 minutes before being due to arrive at the dealership at 6 pm to pick up my new car! This caused problems as my old car had been passed over to my daughter, insurances changed and so on, leaving me without a car. Whilst I was provided with a car touse for the intervening period, it was only when i requested it and not offered readily. The car I was loaned kind of summed up the whole experience - very much lacking in any service delivery quality and just generally disappointing. The loan car was filthy - inside and out, had a large dent to one of the doors which wasnt pointed out either physically or even on the paperwork before I took it and I had to call the garage the following morning just to verify they were actually aware of the damage. There were warning lights on the dashboard - 1 of which was actually highlighted before being handed to me. The other however - to indicate the tyre pressures were low - was not. There was also no fuel in the car and the fuel warning ligt was on.
On the day I collected my car i was expecting something of an 'event' - after all its not every day you purchase a brand new car. However any expectation I had was soon quashed- no big reveal, no balloons not even anyflowers. All experiences which i know friends have had when collecting a new car.
I was promised a follow up call a week after to taking delivery - which predictably has also not happened.

All in all I can honestly say a well below average, hugely disappointing experience at best. A definate case of once the deal was in the bag, the dealership could not have been less interested. Would NEVER recommend based on my experience and it certainly wont be a repeat experience for my next vehicle purchase. The 2 stars are for the experience prior to signing the deal - had it been this bad from the outset, I would have certainly gone elsewhere.

Hugely disappointing Cooper York Mini - an opportunity very definitely missed."
2018-12-11,5,"Simple, easy and painless - the way it should be"
2018-12-11,5,"The garage dealt promptly with my booking for a service, The staff were helpful and the car was cleaned too."
2018-12-11,1,"Cooper Thames Ditton have the most appalling after sales service. They do not return calls and when you complain, they ignore your issues. The issues are consistent and I will not be buying another BMW because of the lack of service."
2018-12-11,5,"Booked a service, got a text message to confirm time and date very quickly. Arrived at 8 am on the day to be met with friendly staff in a comfortable showroom. Easy to park. While awaiting handover of the vehicle enjoyed a coffee and was provided a newspaper. The paperwork was minimal and the service took a couple of hours. I was contacted by phone and picked up my car at the time the staff said it would be ready. Just enough time to look at the new C and E-class models in the showroom and drove off in a well cleaned valeted car.
Thank you.
Paul Eggleton"
2018-12-11,5,"Excellent service from professional staff, always polite, responsive and consistent. All delivered on the agreed dates with forward planning, communication and regular updates. Couldn't have asked for better service!"
2018-12-11,5,"Never mind the horizontal rain on arrival, I was warmly welcomed and a drink offered.
The service person had some technical knowledge with some more technical reasoning would have been welcome beyond the ""it's worth replacing the part recommended by Audi as we will have removed it anyway"".
An interesting courtesy car was offered. Might actually buy it following the 'test drive'.
Excellent service indeed."
2018-12-11,5,I was very well looked after when I had my car serviced at Cooper Reading.
2018-12-10,2,"Just such poor customer service. BMW agreed to return our car at a certain time in order to collect our young children. They were 3 hours late in returning our car. No apology, no customer care. What makes it worse is that this was for a BMW recall notice which has taken over 6 months to get in the diary.
After care service at BMW in non existant."
2018-12-10,5,"Great service, friendly staff"
2018-12-10,5,Excellent customer service. Pleasant waiting area and complimentary coffee. Staff all very polite.
2018-12-10,5,"Good, efficient service ready on time, car returned cleaned inside and out"
2018-12-10,5,"The staff were helpful and knowledgeable and gave good advice. At no point did I feel under any pressure to make a purchase, which was contrary to what I expected."
2018-12-10,5,"Brilliant Excellent.....service from everyone in the sales and service team while buying my Mercedes E class
Thanks guys (we will be back next year)"
2018-12-10,5,"Absolutely excellent service, could not be better. Ash the new car salesman is superb, a real pleasure to deal with. I would highly recommend this dealership and it's staff."
2018-12-10,2,"The staff were nice but I was charged £135, was told it was a faulty battery and the problem I was having has not been rectified. Not very happy and now having to take the car back to the garage, missing more time from work."
2018-12-10,5,They were fine but communication could of been better.
2018-12-07,1,"I had an absolute awful experience - Coopers have no interest in me as a customer. I was left unattended for over an hour when I returned to pick my car up. To many Coopers employees walking around with pieces of paper and totally blanking me.
My wife also had a very similar experience when her mini was being service- together we have spent over £150,000 with Coopers over the last 10 years- I am going to get my next car through Mercedes in Brooklands. BMW make wonderful cars but Coopers Customer Service is beyond belief."
2018-12-07,5,"Fast efficient service, car was collected and returned at the specified time."
2018-12-07,3,"Took a very long time to get vehicle in. Considering the faults were from delivery, wasn’t great. Must comment that vehicle came from a dealership in Aberdeen so it was them who failed to fully inspect vehicle before sending out.

CS excellent and pickup nice and easy.

One of the faults remains unfixed thoug, despite comments to suggest it had been fixed. Could just be a mix up and not had chance to speak with dealership as yet."
2018-12-07,2,"Bombarded with conflicting phone calls. Not very helpful in solving an issue. Engineer removed cable from an aftermarket amp/ speaker which left my radio, phone and parking sensors not working. All working before you sorted out a re call. Refused to help."
2018-12-07,1,"I ordered a bmw from coopers bmw inchcape sunderland and the car was misrepresented to me, on delivery it didnt have what the salesman Craig told me in writing it would have.
To add insult to injury the retail manager Leanne said they would refund some monies to us but after 3 weeks and countless chasing I am still being fobbed off with excuses. I would not recommend this dealer to anybody.
Lesson to learn is do not buy a car from this dealer you havent seen before you pay for it."
2018-12-07,5,"Very good service provided by professional ,courteous ,knowledgeable staff"
2018-12-07,5,"Easy to set up appointments, kind treatment on arrival. The car service was brilliant, as I waited I was emailed a video of my car and showing what is good and not good. This is my genuine rating of the experience. I live locally too which is a bonus, so I will be going back there periodically."
2018-12-07,5,"Smooth service though out, no complaints at all. Thank you to the all the Malton staff."
2018-12-07,5,"Very happy with the service received, all team members very helpful and also health check vidio was very helpful,

Thank You"
2018-12-07,5,Great customer care from Michael - speedy service while I waited
2018-12-07,5,"Had my car in for service and MOT 2 weeks ago and was very happy and I willingly filled in a review when asked. All was excellent! Yesterday I got in to my car for the first time since it had been brought back from its service and I couldn’t believe how fantastic it looked inside! The interior had been valeted, the seatbelts were arranged across the seats beautifully along with a new bottle of VW screenwash and my service manual completion. It was such a surprise and I have to write another review just to say thank you for making the interior of my car look like new again. Can’t recommend Inchcape highly enough for looking at my car."
2018-12-07,5,"I went in for some warranty issues and I have to say the service was excellent, great communication, digital video updates were very helpful."
2018-12-07,1,"Disgusting service from BMW. I have been using BMW Croydon for the last 5 years the first two years I had excellent service from Zoe. Then came along Paul who did not know what he was doing most of the time. Now they have new people who don’t even have a smile on their face, I was served by Vinesh. I can’t explain how rude he was when I had dropped my cars off for service, he looks absolutely depressed working for such a high branded company. When I picked both my cars up they were not washed inside or out. They had taken my car for two days for the recall, I had no problems before it went in suddenly they tell me I have a engine oil leak. I also told them I needed my service done as far as I’m aware it has always cost between £60-£70 for a visual check service, once I came home I checked my receipt I was charged £97.00 because I had to pay for a electric part for the recall. I thought the recall was free of charge? I also received faulse information from Bilal via phone call prior to picking up my cars, no apologies was made. He seemed to care more about the loan car which was provided for me. I spend a lot of money servicing my cars at BMW or repairing them. I feel sad to say I will never return back to this dealership or even spend a penny there. I have always been a loyal customer to them, I have spend thousands of pounds at their dealership. Appalled by their service, don’t bother going to get crap service!"
2018-12-06,5,"Having made several changes to the E Classe options whilst at the same time beating down the price Mark Rose was very polite, patient and accommodating even though they are not my local dealership"
2018-12-06,1,"I,ve bought 3 brand new cars 2 second hand cars from this dealership Chelsmford BMW would I buy another nooooooooo since all the old school salesman have left this site has gone down hill in a major way im trying to buy a BMW pre reg from another dealer coopers of course no help from these at all ask for a manager get passed to a so called adrian manager get accused of being drunk while trying to buy a car please im heart broken to be honest Fairfiled bmw said they have school leavers trying to be salesman lol I agree don't buy from coopers bmw a total disgrace then this so called manager said theses calls are recalled after telling me i sound drunk hello i own my own transport company and was working total disgrace"
2018-12-06,5,Good service keep it up.
2018-12-06,4,"Warranty work. Car collected. Fifth piece of warranty work in 18 months although each has been a minor repair (albeit that on three occasions three warning lights were on, suggesting something serious). Took two days this time as part had to be ordered - fair enough. Returned nice and clean and with complimentary umbrella! Only gripe is that it took almost a month for collection service to be available. For other warranty repairs the only way I could get express service was to have the car recovered on a trailer (3 times). My other car is Mercedes and they always offer service slot with collection within one week so, in comparison, the responsiveness is slow. But always very courteous."
2018-12-06,5,"My wife and I purchased a new Mini from the Colchester Branch this week. From the first time we walked into the garage on Saturday to the time my wife drove the new car away on the following Wednesday Afternoon the customer journey / experience was excellent.
We, along with our 6 year old Son were all part of this wonderful journey that we experienced purchasing our dream new car.
Rhys Candy the Mini Sales Executive in the Colchester Branch who handled our purchase was professional at all times, and answered all our numerous queries, he could not do enough for us"
2018-12-06,5,"Professional, polite and efficient service. Everything explained fully and clearly. Beautiful showroom, easy parking and good coffee too!"
2018-12-06,3,"While the car was picked up in reasonable time and dropped of the engineer who did the health check spoke so fast I couldn't understand what he was saying on the Video....
Come on guys this is not a joke... Its a car health check if your going to do a video to reassure customers then do it properly....!
Otherwise you are wasting peoples time and Money"
2018-12-06,1,"I have add noisy brakes since 16K on my BMW F30
As it was summer time and hot I put the noise down to this as you often hear brakes squeal in hot weather.
Car now has 26K and brake noise getting worse.
Decided to take into BMW at the end of the day, I asked how long will it take and was told should be a day.
Tuned up next day and was told they was wanting for BMW to authorise.
Following day BMW phoned, to say I needed new rear brakes at £200 and some pounds.
I told him that the car has only done 26K , had been making noise since 16K and the wear indicator says brakes have over 40000 left on them.
He went away and one he come back said the brake pads where cracked. I ask if this was not covered but all he kept saying was its general wear, really!
When I continued to moan the price jumped down to £116 as I wouldn't need the disc, why was he quoting these price to start with!
So should I be paying for cracked pads after 16K, well Cooper Ipswich thinks so.
I then asked what they where waiting for BMW to authorise yesterday and the bloke went away and come back and said they weren't.
So I feel I have been lied to as well.
I expect more than this from BMW!"
2018-12-06,5,"I have used Inchcape Jaguar Norwich (formerly HA Fox) for car purchase and servicing for over 8 years. Their professionalism, technical ability and courtesy has never been other than excellent. I recently had new rear disc brakes and pads, new rear shock absorbers and a suspension bush fitted plus other work (including a full health and safety check) on my 9 year old x type, with only 4 hours labour charged (plus parts and VAT of course). A special mention to Phillip Haden and Andrew on reception for their personal attention including arranging free transport into Norwich. The car was cleaned and ready for us by 4pm on the day we took it in. I would also like to thank Sam Pullin and Blake Jarvis on the sales side who have at various times excellently advised me on PCP and a possible Jaguar XE purchase."
2018-12-06,5,Excellent service - Kept informed of work throughout the day
2018-12-06,5,"Amazingly good experience from start to finish.Their cars are top notch,exactly as described and priced to sell.I was given an exellent quote for my part ex and left with half a tank of fuel.My sales advisor was Kesar,exellent service again,right up to leaving after taking a good while to explain how the car operated ... Would definitely use again."
2018-12-06,2,"On the most recent occassion I was dealt with quite promptly for a failed wheel locking device and the branch at Stratford-on-Avon held the necessary spare. After trying on making a charge they did accept that the responsibility lay with Mercedesm and did not make a charge.
But why should one always have to be combative and difficult to get fair play over a minor matter.
My previous experience has been bad here."
2018-12-06,4,"Very welcoming staff who kept me updated all day, which unfortunately is how long it took for my car to be serviced. The service centre seems to be ridiculously over-subscribed with a huge daily workload booked in."
2018-12-06,4,"this was a problem as our Mercedes e class cabriolet was an ex demonstrator from Birmingham and had rain sensor windscreen not working and fault on tyre pressure system.
Service reception was very friendly and helpful and although could not rectify the problems did activate FOC the spare key sent to us.
we have three year service Mercedes contract and will use this service centre in future,"
2018-12-05,5,Excellent service -no complaints.
2018-12-05,5,"Excellent customer service from all staff, would definitely use this garage again."
2018-12-05,5,\dealt with a service advisor called Ellie who could not have been more helpful She even showed me around several of the showroom cars when she heard l was considering changing She should move to sales!!
2018-12-05,5,"Had a great Experiments at Coopers, served by Ali, he helped pick the car and gave lots of information, the car was a couple of days late with delivery due to having a tracker fitted. Would recommend"
2018-12-05,3,"The service was fine, better than average video by Chris, everything explained and Jason ensured a reasonable price......BUT whoever valeted the inside managed to hoover up my CPZ parking permit which I now have to replace. Not happy"
2018-12-05,5,"Great experience! Approachable, friendly staff and quick, trouble free service. Would definitely recommend!"
2018-12-05,5,"I chose to wait whilst my car was serviced at Inchcape Nottingham, very comfortable surroundings, hot drinks, TV and magazines to while away the time. People was very courteous, quick service and I was kept well informed."
2018-12-05,5,Many thanks for Gurv. He was outstanding and made the purchase a pleasure. Will definitely buy my next car from him.
2018-12-05,5,I was so happy with customer service and over welmed by the help what was given to me while I was there
2018-12-05,5,"As always the welcome was warm and friendly. My car went in for a service and MOT and rather than wait I had a courtesy car . All went smoothly and I was also sent a video of the checks made.
The car was cleaned inside and out before I collected it.
The staff at Mercedes North Wales are lovely. Indeed I travel 30 miles to this dealership even though there is a dealership closer to where I live.
Very happy with the service provided ."
2018-12-05,5,"I cant fault the experience I had. Dropping the car off was quick with very courteous staff. The Service was completed earlier than scheduled for me. Collecting it was very quick and easy, and looked good with the free valet. All in all, a great experience."
2018-12-05,1,"I spotted a car, exactly what I wanted at Hyde Audi Inchcape. I immediately requested a video of the car which I received a hour later from Pavan, Video was great.
I am offshore so emails are the main way of communicating. I mailed back asking to get a approx part ex, due to IT issues they were unable to provide this so I decided to ring Pavan but got a answer message, I left a message asking to mail me back in the morning.
I ended up mailing in the morning as had no reply, tried Pavan's mobile and answer machine again.
Eventually I received a mail at lunch time with a part ex value that was lower than other dealers had quoted, I replied and asked to see what they could increase to complete the sale, I also told Pavan in the mail that if price increased I wanted to put a deposit on it to secure the car. No reply in the next hour to the mail so again, rang Pavan's mobile, guess what, the old O2 answer machine again.
I left it another hour, tried the mobile again and still was unavailable, voice mail left again.
I sent a mail asking if there had been any updates, I received a reply 20 minutes later saying his colleague had just sold the car on the phone to another customer.
I mailed Pavan back but a day later I still have no reply.
I would highly recommend people to stay well clear of Hyde Audi and especially Pavan if they are looking for a car.
I am highly disappointed that I have spent months looking for a certain spec car only to lose out on it due to a Sales persons total incompetence and obvious lack in customer service / relations.
I begrudge having to give 1 star for this review."
2018-12-05,5,"I dealt with Carl at Inchcape Hyde and he made the whole car buying process a pleasant one.
He got me a great deal and kept me informed of everything from initially seeing the car through to driving away.
Throughly recommend and I hope to deal with him again when the time comes to change my car. A credit to both Inchcape and Audi

Many thanks again."
2018-12-04,5,"A”Robseal” service , does what it says on the tin. That’s all you can ask for."
2018-12-03,1,"I have a problem with the brakes squeeking on a 2017 Jaguar XF. The attitude from Inchcape Preston is that this is a 'charactersitic of the car' and therefore there is nothing they can do. If I want them to have another look at the car they could book me in for mid January!!

The dealer never returns my calls and indeed I have had to get Jaguar UK involved, however even the manafacturer can't even solicit a response.

Overall appalling service with no desire to help fix my problem. Its a real shame as I've purchased my last two cars from this dealer, however its highly unlikley there will be a third

UPDATE: Its really nice to know Inchcape take complaints seriously and want to follow up to understand how they can resolve them to the customers satisfaction.........oh wait, they just posted a bland response with no desire to try to fix the situation. What a great example of customer service..........."
2018-12-03,5,From initial contact to collecting the car the service received was excellent.The car was a low mileage ex demonstrator and was immaculately prepared and presented on first viewing and collection of the vehicle. We are delighted with all aspects of our purchase.
2018-12-03,5,"PROFESSIONAL,COURTEOUS AND GOOD ATTITUDE TOWARDS CUSTOMERS."
2018-12-03,5,"The salesman Chris was most helpful, would recommend Mercedes Warrington, nothing was to much trouble, extremely pleased with the
car we purchased"
2018-12-03,5,"I bought Jaguar from Inchcape, Preston last week. My sales person was Alan Wood. I honestly can't fault the whole end to end transaction. The sale was completely unpressurised and Alan went out of his way to ensure the experience was pleasant. We were so impressed with Alan that my partner is now in contact with Inchcape to see if Alan can help him find his next car. I would have no hesitation in recommending Inchcape in Preston, and more specifically Alan."
2018-12-02,5,"I bought a BMW on Friday at Belmont and I had an extremely positive experience. I wasn't hassled at all and I received a comprehensive explanation about the car I bought. The staff were professional and I dealt with Kieran who was new, but very knowledgeable and helpful, explaining as much as he could with my quickfire questions or going away to find out answers to my questions, which he did very effectively. I went out on two test drives with him and he gave me training on the cars features which was brilliant. His communication was brilliant, emailing me with a personalised video summarising what we discussed. He also rang me the next day to make sure I was happy with everything. The administration was also excellent. I received my DVLA documents the next day, which shows that they deal with all aspects of the car purchase very efficiently. I was extremely happy with my experience at BMW Belmont."
2018-12-02,5,A very smooth and easy service A*****
2018-12-02,5,"Excellent service from Mercedes-Benz in Leicester. Very straightforward and upfront explanations. No hidden fees and simplification of all options for purchasing. Very professional and friendly service from Nathan, Simeon & Ross!
Came from Birmingham to Leicester and would happily travel here again for my next purchase. Highly recommend this branch no matter how far away you live. The travel is worth the experience"
2018-12-02,5,"Had low tyre warning. I was seen within 2 mins they found a screw in my tyre and changed it straight away. While I was there my daughter had an appointment a member of staff offered to take me, she waited till my daughter was ready then drove us back to collect my car. Brilliant service."

Advertising a Mercedes GLC Coupe 250d AMG Line Premium 2018, 105 miles, registration CX68YOV in Black £34,992, Ex Demonstrator......now thats cheap considering only registered in October 2018 and RRP £44,010. Thats a saving of 20%% for a car registered just over a month ago.....

Hang on, thats for the standard AMG line premium, 19"" wheels etc. The one in the picture has 20"" wheels and stainless running boards, that takes it to £45,055, excl OTR charges. So an overall saving of 22%.

I check their website, no such car listed...in used or nearly new, anywhere in UK
I e-mail them regarding the car....no response other than automated
I call....still awaiting call back

Im sense click bait....especially when a used one, registered in September, same spec, with 4,500 miles is listed for £40,991."
2018-12-01,5,Excellent customer service
2018-12-01,1,"Coopers Sunderland
Offers from this dealership seem good value unfortunately it would appear unless you are local they don't want to sell to you as never return phone calls / emails ect even when highlighted to management which I have never know a retailer you are trying to spend £30kish be like.
Just before you ask me to send you an email to ""tell us more"" with the details for follow up, I did this and still no response."

Sales person Georgina Hudson made purchase of new car very easy and a good experience thanks again car is great.

Kind Regards Tony"
2018-12-01,4,Generally a very good experience. Staff friendly and courteous. Waiting area good and service done as agreed. A couple of minor points - I waited for my service to be completed and was told it would be an hour to an hour and a half. It actually took over 2hours which actually wouldn’t have been a problem if someone had kept me in the loop. Also the car wash didn’t actually wash the drivers door so I had to get it redone. A couple of things to consider but will definitely use this garage again.
2018-12-01,5,Kishan at MBL was fantastic. The handover of my new car was lovely and the experience was very nice.
2018-11-30,5,"Very good service team with good communications and politeness. Disappointing resolution to problem which was no fault of the staff, but is a VW problem."
2018-11-30,5,Good Salesman and very helpful
2018-11-30,5,Excellent service all round vehicle ready when they promised
2018-11-30,5,"Nothing but excellent customer service yet again from Inchcape Mercedes in Oxford. Darren Parsons was able to jump through hoops in order for me to get my ideal car when I needed it.
Highly recommend this dealership."
2018-11-30,5,Excellent service and results from the Cheshire Oaks Audi service centre!
2018-11-30,1,"Scheduled maintenance 6 weeks ago. Once there asked that the job is to be done by noon due to emergency hospital arrangement. They work was completed almost 2 hours late. During this time there has been no communication nor update even though the worksheet clearly stated the urgency. It would have sufficed to be honest at the beginning and state the job cannot be completed on time due to other work. This is not the first issues but the ""norm"": Jobs always take more time and I have never been informed of any delay."
2018-11-30,5,Great experience with Bmw Colchetser Paul Bryant was the sales person I dealt with was very helpful and took me through all the steps from start to end id definitely recommend him and the company many thanks for everything.
2018-11-30,3,"I booked my car in for a brake fluid top up service, they gave me a date, but I explained that I would need the car back by 11am as it was needed for a business trip I had (and this particular job is not a large one). They told me to drop it off the day before which I did at 2.30pm and would make sure it was ready by 11am. I called twice the next day to enquire if the car was ready, was told service would call me, but got no call back at all, until 12 noon.....too late just as I was arriving at the station to get to my appointment! Good at setting high expectations, but don't deliver on them."
2018-11-30,5,"Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The greeting at the door is very welcoming as was the coffee I was given straight away! The service, MOT etc were done quickly and efficiently and the car was returned having been washed. The waiting area is comfortable too. Altogether a very good experience."
2018-11-30,2,"Having ongoing problems with a BMW dashcam since installation 18 months ago. The the dashcam has been working intermittently and eventually stops altogether. Has been repaired 3 times now by BMW and now the warranty is soon to expire so am apprehensive that this last fix will only be another temporary fix. Have requested it be removed and a refund as I feel it is not fit for purpose but BMW not interested. Have requested at last fix to have a video of where the problem was but nobody bothered to contact me to say if possible or not, they just basically ignored the email. Was told at 5pm ( after I called BMW) that car would not be ready for delivery even though I explained this I needed it the next day. Then after much berating was told that it was now ready and would be delivered! Apparently, the wires connecting the machine to the car needed to be swapped over. Did not think wiring connecting an appliance like this are interchangeable! Anyway, not happy with this experience and does not inspire confidence in BMW installation team."
2018-11-30,5,Excellent service
2018-11-30,5,Went out of their way to supply the car we wanted at competitive price. Excellent service and facilities.

2018-11-30,5,"Thourough and professional throughout. A special Mention to Steve at Mercedes-Benz , Liverpool who very approachable and more then helpful."
2018-11-30,2,"I brought my 5 month old BMW 430d in to Cooper BMW Teesside (part of the Inchcape Group) for an unidentified, loud rattling noise when in reverse gear.

The booking system was straightforward and I was able to get a cancellation appointment within 10 days which seemed reasonable. However I was told the time from booking to bringing the car in is ordinarily 4 weeks which seems excessive.

I brought the car in and was dealt with fairly promptly by a service advisor who seemed to vaguely know what he was doing, but seemed very flustered and spent most of his time dashing off to the workshop to find keys and work tickets rather than dealing with customers. I had booked a courtesy vehicle and although it was a MINI (the dealership had run out of BMW courtesy vehicles and were relying on their subsidiary brand located in the adjoining premises for courtesy vehicles), was brand new with a good specification, clean and tidy.

I'd asked if I could quickly take a service technician up and down the service road in my car to demonstrate the noise, which was granted and the technician, who sounded reassuringly knowledgeable; heard the noise immediately, stating ""that's quite alarming for such a new car"".

The dealership had the car all day (which was fine, they suggested it would take this long) and I collected it at 5pm. I was told by the same service advisor that the technician had found the cause of the noise, which was 'a large stone in the braking system'. When I questioned which part of the braking system the stone was in, the service advisor could not answer, and also offered no explanation as to why the braking system was not designed to prevent the ingress of road debris that compromised the braking ability of a £44k vehicle. I was then told I was liable for a £99 diagnostic fee because there was no mechanical failure covered under warranty, despite being told that very morning that I would not be liable for any costs.

Whilst I understand that there were no parts requiring replacing, the service advisor's exact words were 'we have to recover the cost from somewhere'. I suggested that the dealership discuss with BMW, why their braking systems were not designed to keep out large pieces of debris and to recover the cost from them instead. After 10 minutes of heated discussion with the workshop manager and service advisor, they agreed that I wouldn't have to pay any diagnostics fees.

My experience would've been largely positive, were it not for a futile attempt to claw some money back from me. Such money-grabbing tactics is why many main dealers earn their reputation for being unnecessarily expensive.

I would possibly revisit this dealer but would want an agreed, fixed price in writing before agreeing to any work in future."
2018-11-30,3,Parking very limited and frustrating trying to find a place when bringing car for first service. When picking car up the person I spoke to had to go back inside three times as information for my car was wrong. Asking where my car was parked told somewhere over there. My car exterior never been so filthy with cement dust all over it. Not impressed
2018-11-30,5,"As arranged a courtesy car was available and it was a very good service, thankyou."
2018-11-30,1,Car was only in for end of warranty check and recall but rather than the one day as I was told I was without the car for 3 days. I phoned on the second day to find out what was happening but all service representatives were busy so I was told someone would call me but no one did. I had to phone again on the third day to finally be told the car was ready and I could pick it up.
2018-11-30,5,All aspects were 5 star *
2018-11-30,5,"Great service,car went it for recal work done very efficient and even hoover inside and gave car a wash.."
2018-11-30,5,"I recently had my vehicle serviced by Inchcape Macclesfield and wanted to say what a pleasant experience this was. All the staff we dealt with couldn't have done more to help us which included dropping us off in central Macclesfield for shopping & then coming to collect us afterwards. Special thanks to Emma, Gareth, John & Julie for their professional and FUN approach. We'll definitely be back for more!"
2018-11-30,5,"Great service, impressive new showroom. Smooth operation."

2018-11-29,5,Yugesh was very friendly and knowledgeable. Helped us through each step of purchasing our new car. Would recommend Yugesh for his helpfulness and useful advice.
2018-11-29,5,"Fantastic experience at Cooper BMW, Norwich.
Went in with an idea of available budget. Was given a variety of options of different cars but never felt pressured into over spending.
Found the ideal car and picked it up within 4 working days. All very simple.
Fantastic!"
2018-11-29,5,I would recommend Cooper BMW Teesside. Adam Parsons was very helpful and informative. Love my BMW 1 series

2018-11-29,5,For my first main dealer experience it’s well worth paying the premium but very competitive price. All the staff went above and beyond to make me feel very welcome and that my service was carried out very professional especially when from the technician video would highly recommend to anyone
2018-11-29,5,"Having an understanding of the vehicle retail sector and having been a customer of BMW franchises in the past I have to say my experience of Cooper Durham was outstanding. The level of customer service from all staff was second to non. I was so well looked after by Steven Dixon the sales executive (bearing in mind I can be an awkward customer due to my knowledge of the sector) he was able to provide me with a choice of vehicles that matched my requirements and further to the areas outside of his remit he was able to pass me over to the head of finance and the head of business who again given my knowledge were extremely proficient at being able to match my needs with their business needs to provide me with the car I wanted perfectly.
I could not fault any aspect of the sales process and would recommend that anyone in the market for a new or used BMW make Cooper Durham their first (and only) point of contact."
2018-11-29,5,Tonbridge Mini Garage are great very friendly nothing is to much trouble so much better then the mini garage I went to in the beginning I have already recommend a friend they are going down this week

2018-11-29,5,"Easy drop off, easy collection and kept me informed of any issues/concerns that they identified."
2018-11-29,5,"My 330i put into BMW Cooper, Reading for a factory recall issue. I was treated from start to finish with absolute courtesy. The garage also did a full vehicle inspection at no cost. I was given a 4 page written report, and even sent a video of the inspection with commentary. My pride and joy had even been cleaned inside and out. Brilliant experience all round. In the showroom, there was a spotlessly clean lounge, with FOC coffee etc readily available. This completed a very happy visit."
2018-11-29,5,Excellent service!
2018-11-29,5,"I took my BMW 535i to Copper BMW in Tunbridge Wells for a while-you-wait service. Steve Brand dealt with me at Service Reception, he was friendly, polite and extremely helpful. Not only booking the car in, explaining what would be done to the car, explaining the cost etc. but he also chased up an outstanding query I have on the security vulnerability of the BMW keyless entry system. Although the service and courtesy car wash took longer than estimated, Steve kept me informed at all times and ensured I was happy and had something to drink. An excellent service all round."
2018-11-29,5,Excellent service and overall very pleasant experience. Denise Stanley was my Service Advisor and she provided an excellent service. She was very helpful and very knowledgeable.

2018-11-29,5,"I bought a used BMW
from Cooper Teeside which is around 150 miles away from me. The salesman that dealt with me always maintained great communication, was very friendly and helped me get the best deal for my old car, they also threw in half a tank of fuel for the journey home which was a nice touch. Thank you for a great experience."
2018-11-28,5,"I experienced outstanding service from Jak Bailes at BMW Teesside when purchasing a new car. An honest, genuine, fair and efficient transaction from start to finish despite having never purchased a car before.

Knowledgeable about the specific vehicle I was interested in and any information he wasn't 100% sure on, he'd find out as soon as possible. No misinformation was given about the spec and technology in the car, as experienced at other dealers in an attempt to obtain a sale. Aftersale services also offered should any issues arise with the car in the future.

Thanks!"
2018-11-28,5,Excellent service all round. Thanks again.

2018-11-28,5,"Brought a gle from Peter Ward, who was extremely easy to deal with, from the test drive to picking the car up. I had a query that he resolved within 15mins the next day. I’m extremely impressed with the service I was given and would recommend to anyone thinking about a used Mercedes. We are definitely going back when we are ready for another vehicle.
Ian from Nottingham."
2018-11-28,1,"I received a letter inviting me to arrange a recall which I did. A number of phone calls ensued thereafter and after making all my arrangements the date was fixed a month away. Last week I received a courtesy call to remind me of the recall arrangements.
I took the car as arranged on the day and at the close day I was advised that the part required for the recall was out of stock which means the various arrangements by all were totally wasted and no progress made.
The message was conveyed with no remorse or apology and told new arrangements would be made.
This is total mismanagement and lack of respect form people's time.
In the meantime my car might catch fire but there is no concern!!!"
2018-11-28,5,"An excellent experience from start to finish, and a true reflection on Jaguar's quality brand."
2018-11-28,5,"Really slick, well organised, friendly."
2018-11-28,1,"Please be very careful with this dealership Volkswagen Romford, the sales people have not got a clue.
They will promise something, and when comes down to it, they will not remember and deny.
I found them unprofessional and found their tone rude and disrespectful, will be nice at first, but once you've committed to something that's when their true colours will come out.

Initially I offered my car in part ex, so I agreed for a new car with part ex price agreed and put the order in, the day I went to pick up, they had no recollection of part ex and offered me much less for my car then the day I put the order in, because I had already gave deposit, I had no choice but to agree and tell you the truth they confused and baffled me a bit with their scripted sales.

I did complain on the day to the sales person about the part ex,that the error is from their end (thiswas a different person dealing with me from the initial point of contact and day of order) she went missing for a while to go and speak to the manager ( gave me the impression she did not even speak to the manager) and came back with an answer NO.

And when I was about to drive off, part of the deal was full tank off fuel, they even try to have me on that, had to call her back to remind her of the deal. Waited another 1hour for her to deal with this.

When I got home I looked carefully at the sums and was overcharged on my Credit Card of the remaining balance that I paid, unbelievable cheats.

A week later I was in contact with the general manager David Green.
Right wrongen, did not want to reply to me via email.

I had to get VW head office involved that's when he started to reply via email, he even told them he had spoke to me about this on the phone and has cleared everything with me, clearly lying .

I finally got a refund on the overcharged payment on my card, thanks to involving VW head office. But he did not accept the part ex mess up Instead offered me a free car wash, as if I would want to go back to these dodgy dealers.

So I took a hit on that, even though clearly it was a salesperson error of not logging the part ex deal down on the system and overcharging on the deal, clearly the overcharging shows how much error the salesperson had done.

BEWARE of these right cheats, try some other dealer, and actually I've lost trust in VW, will be changing to some other make soon, was sold the dodgy 1.4tsi engined car, drinks more than a bmw M5.

Forgot to mention VW head office have just a limited control over these dealerships, if the dealership does you over big time the head office cannot really do much, this is what the head office told me."
2018-11-27,4,Very minor observation but the offer of a second cup of tea would have been appreciated over the 90 min spent in the lounge area. No doubt I could have asked and received but it would be nice to have been asked.
2018-11-27,2,"I had an appointment at 1pm to accept the handover of my new car.. Nearly two hours later we left the showroom. When we originally bought the car, the salesman's manager said that they would make the handover memorable. It was memorable, but for the wrong reasons."
2018-11-27,5,"A pleasant and friendly first experience, which I like when taking my car in, updated all the way through from booking in to regular updates during the service to pick up. What more can u ask for and will return in the future."
2018-11-27,5,"Matt was the salesman that took us through the process of choosing and buying a new Toyota CHR. There was no hard sell just all the facts and figures for us to make an informed choice - although I think we were ‘sold’ on the car after the test drive. All of the staff are helpful, friendly and polite and , although selling a car to a customer is their aim, they genuinely want to help you choose the right car for your needs. A wonderful service from start to finish. Thank you."
2018-11-26,5,"Fabulous experience with Coopers Norwich.

Salesman was a genuinely nice guy, totally honest and professional, no smarm or pretence. A true gentleman.

4 series will be my 4th BMW, ultimate driving machine, says it all really.

Thank you Coopers,,,🤩"
2018-11-26,5,"Can't thank Paul Hubbard, the used car salesman at Mercedes Benz, Liverpool, enough for all the help, patience, courtesy and professionalism he showed us when we bought our lovely car this past weekend. Nothing was too much trouble and he made us feel like very valued customers. Thanks very much."
2018-11-26,5,"Matt and Anthony were brilliant when purchasing my used 4 series, really easy to deal with and nothing was too much trouble. I’ve purchased from a few main dealers over the years and this experience at Cooper Reading BMW has to be the best yet. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend. Great experience."
2018-11-26,5,"Superb experience at BMW! From Andy finding me a perfect deal, to him picking me up on the day off collection from the train station. Could not fault the service one bit. Highly recommended!"
2018-11-26,5,I took my car into tunbridgewells bmw it was so good had a lovley hire car off them my car was sorted out in one day wI'll be using them again Mr davey
2018-11-26,5,"Politeness, respect, care and attention to detail, the staff really make an extra effort."
2018-11-26,4,"Quick, and cheaper than expected. Commnuncation was also good, although it'd be a bit nicer to explain things more especially it being my car's first VW service, for example service books no longer stamped as all done digitally. I had to find this out myself after frantically searching when I realised the book hadn't been stamped."
2018-11-25,5,Throughout the process Kieran has been exceptional at providing us with the best customer service possible. From initial talks to finding us a deal that was within our requirements / budget to after sale care ensuring we are happy with the car. I cannot recommend this dealership enough and thank you to Kieran for making the whole experience as smooth as possible.
2018-11-25,5,"We recently bought a car from Cooper Cobham MINI. There was no pressure to buy, just sheer enthusiasm for motoring and the product on offer. It took us a while from first seeing something we wanted to being in a position to deal, and our sales representative was patient and helpful in getting us into the new car. A really nice group of people, from the lovely front-of-house staff who offer a refreshment while you wait, to the management who take the time to get to know you and share stories. A really good experience, and a superb car sitting on our driveway. We'll be back."
2018-11-24,5,"I was extremely pleased with the service and professionalism shown by Jo RABY, who provided a polite and courteous approach throughout.
My only concern was the time delay in obtaining a date for the service. Perhaps BMW need to review this, but this is an administrative issue and should not detract from the personnel service which was very good."
2018-11-24,1,Pick up my car after a recall and the Bluetooth connection is not working. I have tried for 4 days to speak to anyone about the problem and neither the service advisor nor service manager available. Really bad experience and lack of any communication from this place to try and resolve the matter. I will never recommend BMW Cobham to anyone based on what I have experienced. I am still waiting to hear back to what they will do about this problem.
2018-11-24,2,"I arrived punctually for my service appointment to find the service desk unmanned. I waited for ten minutes by the empty desk before I was seen by a receptionist who booked in my car. There was no apology for being kept waiting.

After I collected my car I went to the new car sales area and spent a similar amount of time waiting for a salesperson to speak to me. I could clearly be seen by the staff through their office window but they were far too busy talking to each other and ignored me. Finally a person walked past into an office so I followed him and knocked on the door. I asked for a brochure which I was given but told I couldn't see any colour samples for the model I was interested in as they were all out of date. The salesperson was not interested in helping me any further so I left vowing never to return to Cooper Thames Ditton.

An unacceptable wait on arrival, disinterested and unhelpful sales staff, and a broken coffee machine made for an unpleasant experience.

The following day I received a ""How did we do"" e-mail asking me to post a review. I do not like leaving a negative review without giving the business an opportunity to address my concerns so I sent an e-mail directly to the company. I had a return note promising a reply within two hours. Three days later I still have not had an answer which is just another example of the regard in which they hold their customers."
2018-11-24,4,"The date booked for the service was predicated on a loan car being provided. However, 24 hours before the service date a call was received stating no cars are available and a complimentary taxi would be provided to ferry my wife to work and back to collect our BMW. This was satisfactory and a good sensible alternative. When we collected our BMW later that day my wife noticed the BMW Logo bobble attached to the key ring was missing. This bobble was the size of a pound coin (and useable in shopping trollies) with a BMW logo one side and contact details of the BMW dealership (Bokker BMW, Blackburn) where we bought the car new in May 2017. On pointing this out your service advisor Adam, who acknowledged that he had also seen it when the key was handed over earlier. After some initial enquires he offered my wife a new key ring from the shop, which was not the same thing but, she accepted it as compensation for the missing bobble. This issue was a point of principle which to the credit of Adam was very well handled and resolved quickly to avoid further embarrassment. Cooper BMW Croydon are a good repetuable organisation and therefore, such incidents can be embarrassing but, credit to you people it was resolved quickly with no unnecessary fuss. However, you might want to look into why such an incident happened in the first place to avoid repetition with another less reasonable customer. Overall, our experience was very satisfactory. Thank you Mr. Shakeel Cockar."
2018-11-24,4,Prompt service car collected and returned within specified times. Returned to my home in a clean condition both inside and out
2018-11-24,5,I was dealt with quickly by a very pleasant and friendly young lady. Kept informed about my repair and called as soon as it was finished. I can't fault the service I received.
2018-11-24,5,"We were looked after very well by Paul, Andy & Assaf. We were able to purchase and receive our car very quickly and smoothly"
2018-11-24,5,"Friendly helpful staff.
Kept up informed on progress etc
Excellent job"
2018-11-24,4,"Polite and helpful service, parking a bit difficult."
2018-11-23,5,All good. It was great to have a sparkling clean car again too!
2018-11-23,5,Very efficient despite being very very busy and staff running in all directions to cope.
2018-11-23,5,"Had the best car buying experience ever here. Friendly staff from receptionist to the general manager. Couldn't do enough for you. Easy to find dealer location. Made the buying & selling process quick & stress free. Nothing I asked was too much for them. All my requests were dealt with efficiently & promptly. Car was valeted & detailed to a high standard. As the car I was buying had been prepared & serviced I was able to drive off in my new car as soon as I wanted to, no long wait as I have had from other dealers.
I have never used this dealer before as it is a 2 hour drive from my house, but I would recommend it and would happily use it again."
2018-11-23,5,"shopped on line and found the car we wanted, Bmw 320, purchasing from Ireland, well its, a long distance purchase !.Committing and paying for a car we hadn't seen, can make you a little exposed, But we listened to Mark and he assured us, of his full attention, and a showroom delivery. To be fair, when it arrived, the car was as described and unable to fault, It was mint.
That was a month ago, and we are delighted, Thanks to Mark and all in BMW Cooper. M Kelly."
2018-11-23,5,"Just had my car serviced - quick and competant as always, and sparkling clean afterwards"
2018-11-23,5,"perfect service, no problems at all, all staff super kind."
2018-11-23,5,"Picked up our car from Grant today. We had had some problems as my wife could not find her driving licence (we're in the middle of a house renovation). Similar to the Lone Ranger, Grant was on the case to sort matters out. Nothing was too much trouble for him. He was extremely knowledgeable and did everything possible to be helpful. This is my third Mercedes and Grants' was the best service experience I've ever had from a Mercedes dealer. Thanks Grant."
2018-11-23,5,Good personal service.
2018-11-23,5,Pleasurable experience. Sophie was very helpful throughout the purchase. Couldn’t fault them so far.
2018-11-23,5,"helpful and not pushy at all, car priced very competitively"
2018-11-23,5,"Just bought a not-quite-new BMW 118i from Coopers in York and I have to say it was unlike many car dealer experiences! Ian and Oliver, who helped with the car itself and the financing respectively, were friendly, polite and very clear and straightforward with their approach. At no time did I feel that anything (extra this or that) was being foisted upon me, and I’d not hesitate to recommend Coopers to anyone looking for a new motor. Also should add the car is brilliant!"
2018-11-23,2,"Brought my car in for an MOT with no bad experiences before. When picking up, I found a chip out of the paintwork at the back of the car (plus multiple scratches) which I know wasn’t there prior, due to cleaning the car the day before.

I was told to expect a call to get the issue sorted and am still waiting.

The chip is not necessarily something I need done quickly but is also something I can’t afford to let affect the re-sale value of the car, as I have always tried my best to keep the car in the best condition possible.

I am becoming quite disappointed in the lack of communication thus far."
2018-11-23,5,A simple purchase with minimal hassle. Would highly recommend. Zak is a top man and very helpful.
2018-11-23,3,"Just bought a Freelander 2 from Inchape in York, no problem with the sales side of things the salesman was very polite and friendly. After having the vehicle for only one week I had a warning light come on telling me about a fault with the ABS system, this is when I found out that I was not covered by Land Rover Assistance, luckily I only needed advice but I was without assistance cover for nearly two weeks before it was eventually sorted.
When the vehicle was taken back to Inchape for the ABS problem to be rectified this is when the problems started. I had to make three return visits to sort out the problems, this may seem reasonable to some people but I had to make unnecessary visits to York because of problems with their service department. I live on the East Coast so this resulted in an extra 200 miles travelling time not to mention the inconvenience. Admittedly they did put some fuel in the tank in way of recompense."
2018-11-23,5,"Service team are great, every time I need anything they go above and beyond, would recommend to anyone"
2018-11-23,5,"Excellent service, they picked up and dropped off the car for its service. It had been washed too when I got it back."
2018-11-23,4,"Adam was very helpful and clear about all services on offer.
Great experience and very happy with my new motor.
Thanks"
2018-11-23,5,"We had a very nice experience buying the car from Nigel, a professional through and through. We would not hesitate to recommend Cooper Durham and will certainly return for our next BMW purchase."
2018-11-23,5,"Very professional, helpful and friendly atmosphere.
Looked after my children to, and made them drinks and gave them balloons.
I leased a Toyota Aygo off them, due to the fact they worked hard to get the right price which I could afford, plus used my old car for scrap against the price of the new car.
Impressive.
Thank you very much
Helen."
2018-11-23,3,"DISREGARD for expressly stated HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERN:

Altrincham VW technicians put a strongly scented freshener in the air conditioning / heating system and this makes my breathing difficult when in the car: I am having to drive with the windows open in this cold winter weather. I AM WORRIED ABOUT MY HEALTH AND SAFETY WHEN DRIVING.

I made express and specific mention of my asthma being made worse by the FRESHENER put by VW on the air conditioning system and I ASKED the customer service representative to have it removed from the cooling system. The representative told me that they couldn't remove it because it is a tablet that is now in the internal system. Despite all this, yesterday they put freshener in the system again."
2018-11-22,3,"A very indifferent experience. No offer of refreshment or invitation to help myself, assuming the machine was working and I would know how to use it. Was told car was ready for collection, but still had to wait about 20 minutes after arrival. Still waiting for video inspection of car taken during service. Still waiting for confirmation of MoT appointment. Think I might take it somewhere else next time."
2018-11-22,5,First class experience with my 3-year service. Friendly and attentive staff and car service (of the 'express' variety) was complete within one hour. I will certainly bring my car to the department for the next service.
2018-11-22,5,"My Mini went in for a service, at the time booked, it was returned to me at the time I was told it would be completed and had been cleaned inside and out.
I was very happy with the service I received."

2018-11-22,4,Happy with service received no problems
2018-11-22,5,Have gone back to BMW after a few years with Landrover and was please to find out that they still provide a first class service. Would recommend them for the quality of second hand car sales & service.
2018-11-22,5,Great service from the staff and reasonable prices. Many thanks
2018-11-22,5,Excellent Service. I have MOT and full Major Servicing done. Little expensive but definitely I will be going back to them again and again.
2018-11-22,1,"When the front head light bulb went off a few weeks ago, I ringed the dealer to see how they can help me. The woman from the service team said she would not know the exact issue and recommended to visit the shop. So I did in the following day but I was told by Mr A to come back again as all technician went home already. Above woman asked me to come by 6.00pm and I did but this happened even though it was still 5ish. Mr A also suggested to purchase the light bulb and so I did. In the following day I went to the dealer again and I was told by Mr B that they cannot do anything until January as their schedule is fully booked whereas we were still in Mid November. They were hopeless and so I had to give u. I had to ask the person who is dealing with accessories to refund the bulb but he refused as it was an electric part. I did not know that there was such a policy. I felt I was terribly treated and cheated by BMW, and I decide to quit a BMW owner as I do not feel having a premium car at all. Their service is like for a low budget car. Afterwards I headed to Halfords and they fixed my issue in 10 min. Very efficient and that was first class!"
2018-11-22,4,Good customer service. Although the price wasn’t cheap the price quoted was the price billed. No hidden extras.
2018-11-22,5,"Great service,"
2018-11-22,5,"Just recently purchased a new car from Cheshire oaks, James was utterly professional, friendly and extremely helpful!

2018-11-22,5,"Rod Lane was my sales rep and he has been excellent !
my first time with VW and its been nothing but simplicity which is excellent!
Rod has taken care of everything even down to my car Mat's which he personally installed himself for me !

2018-11-22,5,"An absolute pleasure to deal with this BMW dealer in Durham. Especially Simon Thompson made the whole experience a very good one!
We had to drive 352 miles (7 hours) from our home to Durham.
There are BMW dealers closer to home but I would not think of going anywhere else but this one."
2018-11-22,4,"First class service from the start. I needed a vehicle as soon as possible with very little notice, Inchape Mercedes were able to supply me with a vehicle to my desired specification within 2 days of contacting them. Very happy with the information and helpfulness of the team and their general customer service was exemplary."
2018-11-22,5,Great customer service from start to finish - it made buying a new car easy and without the stress. I would definitely use MB Warrington again!
2018-11-22,4,"Very good service and went the extra mile to make sure that we got the car on the day we needed it. A little bit of a wait to get the final paperwork but the Latte's were very nice and really welcome.

2018-11-22,5,"Prompt, efficient service."
2018-11-21,5,"My wife's recent purchase of her new BMW from Cooper in York was without doubt the best car buying experience we have enjoyed.
Daniel Feather is, in my view, a consummate professional who offers an honest and open approach to selling. The price of the car was the most competitive in the area and the service, from start to finish, the best.
What more can you ask?"
2018-11-21,5,Really happy to have had the car serviced at VW stockport. I go their all the time. Staff and service are excellent. Thumbs up and thankyou 100% well recommended. I know we're to take my VW
2018-11-21,5,"A well deserved 5 stars, excellent dealership from selecting my new car to collection. The service I received from Salesman David Rubin was outstanding, great knowledge and experience. I would highly recommend Mercedes Benz Southport and David Rubin to anyone looking to purchase a new or used Mercedes."

2018-11-21,4,"I enjoyed dealing with the team at Liverpool, they worked hard to find me the right car and kept things simple, having previously ordered a car from the same team for my wife. I had no issues with either experience other than some minor/insignificant amends with regard to paperwork.
I would be more than happy to buy from the team again when the opportunity arises.
Regards Neil"
2018-11-21,2,"A review of two halves:- B service on 3 year old Mercedes C200
Firstly the service booking on line was quick and easy
The reception staff were pleasant and efficient
The car was ready when promised, and we were texted to confirm this.
Could not fault the whole experience.
But on the other hand charging £465 for a service which only involved an oil and sparkplug change plus air filters is ridiculous. Quickfit quoted £160 for the same work. I am seriously questioning a change of brand for my next car."
2018-11-21,5,"Picked the car up and returned both at acceptable times, Full service carried out including a cleaning. No hassel apart from having to reset the drivers seat"
2018-11-21,5,Great company fantastic customer service !! Collected our tiguan today and this company is a pleasure to deal with a1 customer service that we seem to find disappearing rapidly with large companies. Richard Adam's is great to deal with and nothing too much trouble .
2018-11-21,5,"It’s great experience, I have referred one of my friend, next service he will visit your work shop. Thanks"
2018-11-21,5,"Love my new Mini Countryman. Wonderful service from start to the end. Ask for Charlie in sales he will really go the extra mile and make the whole process a really enjoyable one.
Thank you Charlie, now to learn all the buttons."
2018-11-21,5,"Just bought a used Honda from Paul at Inchcape, he made the whole experience hassle free and easy. It was a pleasure to deal with him, nothing was too much trouble and the service was impeccable throughout! Would highly recommend to anyone and we will definitely go back there in the future."
2018-11-21,5,"Everything carried out in great professional manners, car wash is ok but didn’t clean from inside, no vacuum from inside

2018-11-21,5,"First Service at a Jaguar Dealer. All went really well. Service Manager was very thorough and courteous. Staff all friendly and smiley! :-)
I would thoroughly recommend. The only bad point is the drooling one gets, looking over all the lovely new Jags and Land Rovers for sale!!! Thank you!"
2018-11-21,4,"I was a bit disappointed about the service I received yesterday.
I came to collect my new vehicle, under the assumption that everything was sorted and I could sign my documents and drive away. Instead I was in the dealership waiting nearly 90 min for the revlent paperwork to be sorted?! I would of thought this would have been sorted for my arrival. It was through no fault of the staff member dealing with myself.
I just feel since David Skeen ( who has been amazing) was no longer dealing with myself due to personal reasons, I was passed from Pilar to post, with lots of phone calls/emails (normally this information was repeated.) I was just disappointed yesterday awaiting 90 min for my vehicle, so I could go. It’s not really the service you’d expect from a company such as Mini/BMW."
2018-11-21,5,Service department were amazing. So efficient and helpful. Sorted me out quickly and were really helpful. 5/5 for sure!

2018-11-21,5,Very polite and helpful service. Transaction completed with minimum fuss. I recommend this company without reservation.
2018-11-21,5,Very friendly and helpful. Service was totally customer focused.
2018-11-21,2,"The Salesman we always deal with was unfortunately very ill. So after many unreturned phone calls chasing the delivery of our new car, we were eventually assigned to a young salesman who frankly couldn't be bothered with us as he wasn't making any commission from our transaction.
The experience of picking up our brand new AMG was rushed and frankly spoilt after waiting over 6 months from our original order & deposit. When we finally drove away the car was practically empty of petrol (only 3.6 litres remaining) and had we not stopped to fill up would have broken down on the M6 motorway.
After phoning the Dealer Principal the following day, he was most concerned and eager to make reparations by taking ownership of the situation. He offered to take the in car for a full valet/GardX and fill the tank, which has now been done to our satisfaction.
This is our second new Mercedes from Inchcape Coventry and one of the main reasons for returning not only to the brand but this dealership in particular was the original salesman, who is polite, knowledgeable and extremely professional. Unfortunately, it seems not all the sales staff have quite the same high standards. It shouldn't matter whether we are a cash customer or taking out one of their finance packages, the courtesy afforded should be the same."
2018-11-21,3,Not happy with attitude of service manager over a minor issue.
2018-11-20,5,"Great service, pleasant staff."
2018-11-20,5,"We recently purchased a used car from this Mercedes dealership at Stratford on Avon. Whilst the value of the car was probably at the bottom of the range for a Mercedes dealer, we felt that we received the same high level of service as someone buying a car five times the value. The sales staff were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and took the time to ensure we received a pleasant experience. We had been searching for a used Mercedes for some time and have visited a number of dealerships in the North and across the Midlands. This one was head and shoulders above the rest for customer service. We would thank Lee Blaber in particular for his time. Would not hesitate for a second to use this dealer again."
2018-11-20,5,Excellent communication given and great attention to detail within the service. Any issues resolved professionally and quickly. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend
2018-11-20,5,"Ben was courteous, helpful and friendly. He took the time to understand my issues, offered solutions and found answers to all my questions. His attitude and honesty were quite refreshing and reassuring. Will certainly be looking to organise my services with him in future and would be happy to recommend him to anyone with an Audi."
2018-11-20,5,"Adam Parsons from the sales was very sincere and helpful from the time I called to enquire about the car to liaising with me and finally making the sale successful.
The radio/CD system failure has made me upset but hoping to get it fixed in the local dealership."
2018-11-20,5,"Quick and easy to book over the phone with price agreed up front. Appointments were available for the following week, which was rarely the case at other garages I've used. I was given a Golf courtesy car. All work done within a few hours."

2018-11-20,3,"This is a fantastic new building but the experience is not as good as it was at the old premises
Waited 45mins to collect my car in-spite of being told it was ready
told the the service history and the video had been emailed, still waiting, tried to contact three times by land line still unable to contact anyone who could help.
I am at the end of the three year service contract no mention of addition cover or how to extend the breakdown cover."
2018-11-20,1,"I purchased a used Mini Countryman from Cooper Cobham Mini on the basis of a test drive and a specification that they emailed me when I enquired about the car. Only once I had purchased the car did it become clear that the specification they had provided related to a later model. My car did not have some of the features which were listed as standard equipment in the specification provided. I immediately raised thisissue with Cooper Cobham but, other asking me to pay a lot more to change the car to a slightly later model with the missing features, they refuse to consider other solutions. The dealer also blames Mini UK for the dealer providing the wrong specification! I am now pursuing a formal complaint against the dealer using Inchcape's formal complaints procedure."
2018-11-20,5,"Superb service from Steve in the Service dept and his colleagues, Sorted out in one visit a major service, mot, recall work and even liaised with kwik fit to sort 2 tyres out for the mot.

2018-11-20,5,Brilliant service for a re-call job! Thank you!
2018-11-20,5,"All members of staff most helpful and courteous. A very civilised experience in terms of facilities eg comfortable waiting area and ad lib refreshments. Service team check with you what extras, if any, require attention. A video is emailed to you which shows you the visual check of your car and comments on the state of all the key areas. A detailed list is sent of the work done and the cost involved (if you don’t have a service plan in place). On your return to the dealership you are then talked through what has been done again and then, in my case anyway, the car was driven round to the main door for me."
2018-11-20,5,Great deal. Sadly PDI did not show up hole in leather seat back. Got to go back to have new seat back fitted

2018-11-20,5,"Following a short front desk routine, I dealt with one of their service guys - Sam- who informed me about the process they're following and any update as and when. Service was completed in a timely manner during when I was offered cup of tea/coffee (or soft drinks). The wait in the lounge did not feel too long and after the service was completed I found my car cleaned and hoovered nicely."
2018-11-20,3,"I was advised that the 90 minute safety recall could be up to two hours but ended up being 2 3/4 hours.
Didn't feel communication was good as although I reported to the receptionist, on time, I still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seen.
Confusion when I returned to collect as the maintenance manager was (quite rightly) at lunch but no one else seemed aware.
Also, another receptionist said that I couldn't have left the car and wait (or go for a nice long walk) as 'recalls' are full day jobs and they will call when finished."
2018-11-20,5,"I would highly recommend Mercedes Liverpool, their customer service is excellent. All the staff are both friendly and knowledgeable and more than willing to help. I dealt with Kal who is great, he's very friendly and sincere and he helped me every step if the way including with after sales help and advice. Jon the finance man was also very helpful and explained everything I needed to know. 5 star treatment, so happy to recommend them."

I was made to feel at ease the whole time and without feeling pressurised at all which I find is normally the case when car purchasing !

Would highly recommend BMW Sunderland !
Great coffee !!
Thank you Chris !"
2018-11-20,1,Very poor customer service. The staff don't seem to care. Gone are the days when Mercedes used to put loyalty and customer service first. I have had Mercedes cars all my life but this is the last one.
2018-11-20,4,Overall excellent service although I would prefer to talk to the actual branch rather than the service booking line
2018-11-20,3,"Had to wait a lot longer than expected/was lead to believe. nearly two hours from taking in car to getting it back for two tyres to be changed.
Also unfortunately on the day the waiting area was unpleasantly cold and the coffee area was being refurbished so noisy. That said all people I came in contact with were very pleasant and courteous."
2018-11-19,5,"I have just effected a part-exchange to buy my 6th car from Inchcape Guildford. Every time has been an experience of friendliness, courtesy and professionalism and I cannot speak highly enough of the staff and their attention to the detail of customers' requirements. All of my cars have been looked after by this dealership and my experience of their service has never varied - absolutely first class."
2018-11-19,5,Excellent service from Kevin and the team
2018-11-19,4,Very helpful service from staff in the used landrover department. New showroom was very impressive.
2018-11-19,5,A genuine pleasure to do business with the team at Cooper BMW ! Louis in sales looked after me from start to finish and this was complimented by Justin ! A stunning vehicle delivered all as per specification. Swift and consistent communication with no dramas leading to a highly enjoyable experience. Thanks guys !
2018-11-19,5,"I was impressed when Mercedes were able to book me in to this dealership within the space of a couple of days. Paul looked after me in services - he’s friendly, polite and you definitely feel like he genuinely cares about his customers. Sylvia on reception is kind and helpful and made sure I had a nice cup of tea whilst I was waiting. I would definitely recommend this dealership, thank you."
2018-11-19,5,"My first MOT with Mercedes Warrington Inchcape was a pleasant experience. From the easy booking system online picking a day and time slot to the same day MOT with only a 1 hour wait. The staff were friendly and efficient, I will deinfitely be continuing my MOT and service every year with Mercedes Warrington."

2018-11-19,3,"All went well with car although I wasn't expecting any issues with it being it's first service. However the paperwork or free check as it was called was all listed as N/C meaning not checked, she I enquired u was told itvwas fine. The cost is one thing but not having the paperwork to confirm the service history and safety doesn't correspond with the brand."
2018-11-19,5,"Popped in for a safety recall...found the staff were v helpful and friendly.....good profesdional conduct....told me a few advisory points but were not pushy....all in top notch service...Abbey who was dealing with me was professional and v polite...

2018-11-19,5,"Just bought a new BMW 520 from Cooper York. It was a really good experience. Ross looked after us well with his well informed and good humoured approach, and made it very a straight forward end enjoyable process."
2018-11-19,3,"Unfortunately the coffee machine in the lounge upstairs was out of action which mean carrying hot drinks upstairs and there was only one type of biscuits available as a snack which after a 3+ hour wait got a little boring. My departure was delayed twice and not terribly well communicated but as I was given an unprompted gift for my trouble I've given the customer service an extra star. The location means it is hard to walk to a shop to get your own snacks, next time I'll clearly have to bring my own."
2018-11-19,5,A very good service !!!
2018-11-19,5,"Very professional. No pressure, no fuss, was always kept up to date, questions were answered quickly and I felt like I got a fair deal. This is the second time I have bought from Inchcape and will do so again in the future."
2018-11-19,5,"Great experience and great customer service from start to finish.
I was kept in touch throughout the process and the handover was very impressive. Friendly, competent staff who I would recommend highly."
2018-11-19,5,"Professional, very helpful and friendly."

2018-11-19,5,Great service and help with the purchase of my new Toyota and kept me informed on the progress of the delivery
2018-11-19,5,"Simple to book in, did the job while we waited, couldn't be any more straight forward."
2018-11-19,4,"Friendly, efficient and informative service."
2018-11-19,5,Great service every time!
2018-11-19,3,"I had booked my 2016 GLA for sw updates and maps updates as my home address did not exist in the 2016 Mercedes maps. All updates were completed however my home address still does not exist in the new 2018 Mercedes maps version, while GoogleMaps and Waze are able to find it.
As the Mercedes sat nav system is not very intuitive I requested their support to edit the current address saved in ""Go home"" shortcut (that is somewhere 100 miles away from where I leave) to somewhere close to my home that Mercedes maps are able to find (like the Halfords across the road). A couple of service advisers joined me inside my vehicle to help but none were able to find how this can be changed. You would expect Mecedes employees to be trained how to operate Mercedes products.
Also asked them to help me out with my Mercedes me app. This did not happen either as they could connect to the app on that day due to a ""system"" error."
2018-11-19,5,Great service from Christina Drabble in BMW Norwich. Highly recommended
2018-11-19,5,"Mercedes Benz Warranty Recall.
A very modern and well run Dealership with a focus on its customers."
2018-11-19,5,"Excellent Customer service from beginning to end, can not fault them."
2018-11-19,4,"Every thing was ok except no one contact us Day before the service was booked as the vehicle to be collected
And vehicle was not delivered back on the same day no one contact us to tell us"
2018-11-19,3,Staff were very polite but the whole process of buying a new mini was painfully slow. I think in total both me and my wife spent about 7-8 hours in total signing paperwork and getting things processed. On day of collection there was another 90 mins of paperwork checking before 10 mins of being shown the car.
2018-11-19,5,Just purchased a new Mini Cooper. Very helpful & efficient staff
2018-11-19,5,Simply amazing service.. would love to do business and no hesitation to recommend. BRILLIANT !!!!!!!

2018-11-18,4,"Efficient, prompt, courteous, helpful and friendly. Only negative was not receiving my video of the underneath of the car. I would have liked that, but I did not know it was going to happen so I’ll get over it."
2018-11-16,5,"Very helpful sales staff, Adrian thoroughly explained all aspects of buying the car, and showed me all the features of the car I was buying. I was well informed throughout, and am very happy with the car."
2018-11-16,5,I recently purchased a Mercedes and found the whole experience professional and attentive. Richard who I dealt with was really helpful and returned all my calls and answered any questions. I will always use Cheshire Oaks now. Well done.
2018-11-16,5,Very impressed with the service process for my Lexus with Lexus at Guilford - very professional and easy to do.
2018-11-16,5,"Everything went very smoothly, and James the salesman was very helpful and friendly to deal with."
2018-11-16,5,Excellent service and very friendly and helpful staff.
2018-11-16,3,"Lovely, friendly sales staff making for an unusually pleasant used car-buying experience (that was good value) let down by car preparation prior to collection.
Having purchased a used BMW 216d Gran Tourer from a very pleasant member of the sales team I was disappointed when I collected the car to find that one of the speakers didn't work, the parcel shelf was missing, the voice recognition only worked occasionally, one of the tyres was well below the specified pressure, and the car should have been serviced during the month before. After a number of phone calls and emails, these faults were rectified fairly quickly and the car was swapped with another BMW whilst the rectification took place, but the swap back of my car with the loan vehicle was poorly orchestrated and nearly lead to my family being considerably inconvenienced, mainly because phone calls to the dealership went unanswered for most of Saturday morning."
2018-11-16,5,Great service. All good.
2018-11-16,5,Great service - would not hesitate to recommend
2018-11-16,5,"Kept updated throughout great communication, thank you."
2018-11-16,5,Very friendly staff. Definitely recommend.
2018-11-16,4,"Informed the team that I was 40 minutes away and they rang me at 17:20 to tell me the car was ready - bit of a panic as the website states you close at 18:00 , and when I got there they told me that someone was there until 18:30!
Apart from that, fine."
2018-11-16,5,"I recently bought a car from the Durham branch of Cooper BMW. I was served by Alan Birks and the service was 1st class, he really bent over backwards to get me a good deal. If you go there be sure to ask for him."
2018-11-15,5,"I booked the car in for a major service & agreed a timed arrival, all was efficiently handled by Jenny and she confirmed I would receive a video & report on the condition of my car by the technician. This duly arrived followed up by a phone call to confirm I was happy. The car was actually ready an hour before the agreed time and it had been washed - result!"
2018-11-15,4,"Traded my Mercedes for a Range Rover Evoque. Living a long distance from Norwich this deal was done mainly by phone and computer. I would have liked to have turned around quicker, however the deal went through very smoothly. I dealt with Sam Patrick who was courteous and helpful throughout.
Thank you"
2018-11-15,5,From entering the showroom we were made very welcomed and offered a hot drink. All the staff were very friendly and helpful explaining everything to us. I am very happy with the service and the jobs they did on the car. Very proficient. Neville. Barlow
2018-11-15,5,"The experience couldn't have been better. Car collected, serviced and brought back while I was at work. Very courteous staff, this is the way forward.
Thanks Lexus😊"
2018-11-15,5,"All good,....thanks"
2018-11-15,5,Great service from Michael and Alvin from start to finish. They knew I rarely had a lot of time on my hands when I visited the dealership and were always well prepared and quick. The car and deal fitted my needs perfectly and no stone was left unturned. If TrustPilot had 10 stars they would have deserved every single one of them.
2018-11-15,5,"Absolutely fantastic service, everything explained to the full, was well looked after from management to sales
Lovely courteous people, more than highly recommend"
2018-11-15,5,I was telephoned the day before to confirm the pick up time. My car was collected by a very courteous driver on the day at the time indicated and it was the same driver that returned my car at the end of its service and MOT. I couldn’t fault the service.
2018-11-15,4,Very helpful once I saw the staff. Just took a little time on a couple of occasions to find someone to speak to
2018-11-15,5,"Excellent, efficient and polite service"
2018-11-15,5,Felt I was important to them. Excellent ambience and nothing was too much trouble. Organisation was top drawer.
2018-11-15,5,Great friendly service
2018-11-15,2,"My two year old X1 came in for it's first service recently with approx. 12,000 miles on the clock. I was charged £288! Five ltrs of synthetic oil was charged at an eye watering £87. (You should be allowed to buy the oil from Halfords and give it to the service technician to use on the day. That would save nearly £40!). I also was sent a 1 min ""health check video"" of the car tyres and underside. This is a total nonsense! The commentary was inaudible as the workshop noise drowned out most of the technician's mumbles! Finally the car was returned, after a rather streaky ""complimentary"" wash but still showing it needed a service!! The service reset had not been reset! I phoned Coopers and was told ""we have a new system which allows us to reset the service interval remotely"". Well, that didn't work either so I had to go back to Coopers to have them do it properly. But I did get a cup of ""complimentary"" coffee. Neither the video, the car wash or coffee is complimentary. We, the customer, pay for it all. I also received a text from a service advisor asking about my experience and saying she ""would love full marks"". Cheek!. The text stated ""I would just like to make sure that you was happy...."" Was happy? Whatever happened to English grammar. It's were happy!! I have pointed this out to this same service rep twice before and each time she promised the word would be corrected. No joy so far. All in all I will be using my favourite garage for my next service and certainly not Coopers Chelmsford."
2018-11-15,2,Reception and service staff were good but bearing in mine I took my amg there for a service I was told I wasn't allowed to look / get into in any of the amgs in the showroom by the sales staff very rude
2018-11-15,4,"Car Service

Welcoming and well organised when I arranged the service. All went according to plan, but I would 'drop off' the night before in future."
2018-11-15,5,Very helpful and very pleasant welcome
2018-11-15,5,Waited for my service - nice and quick.
2018-11-15,4,"minimum fuss dealt with efficiently and proffessionally, as you would expect with a high end service provider."
2018-11-15,5,"Great team at Cooper Tonbridge (especially Clare), it made a refreshing change dealing with an experienced team who were respectful & professional! Slick process & very good all-round communication - listening to what we were looking for & keeping us informed while we waited for delivery. Very fast to answer post sales questions as well."
2018-11-15,5,"Always do a good job, friendly and helpful"
2018-11-15,5,Excellent service. My first dealing with Inchcape Swindon. Penny was superb and looked after me. They were prompt and very helpful.
2018-11-15,5,"Serviced my GT86 while I waited and were prompt, efficient and professional and charged exactly what they originally quoted. Car was cleaned and well presented and I received good coffee and nice biscuits while I waited. Waiting area was clean and comfortable with a good selection of magazines to read. What more can you ask for? I big thumbs up from me."
2018-11-15,5,"Excellent service, staff keep you well informed.
All in all a very pleasant experience."
2018-11-15,2,"Decided to buy a Mercedes from Inchcape Liverpool after researching online and finding they had the model etc that I was looking for.
Emailed an enquiry -no response. After 24 hours I rang, no salesman available so someone would ring me back-no contact. Another 24 hours rang again, salesman took details and would ring back, no response. Rang again, salesman had taken phone number(s) and email incorrectly!
If it wasn’t for the fact that this car was exactly what I was looking for I wouldn’t have pursued the purchase.
Eventually agreed figures with the business manager or sales manager over the phone on Saturday morning. I emailed re confirming all of the information and agreeing that I would make the 6 hour journey to collect the car the following Wednesday.
The invoice was emailed to me on the Tuesday and I transferred full funds on that day.
On arrival at the dealership, (after a tortuous 8 hour train journey)the car was ready but the spare key was locked in a safe and the person with the key had gone home. This was at 4.30pm.
I took delivery of the vehicle and it is lovely. However, after I had cleared the rush hour traffic in Liverpool and was familiarising myself with displays etc I noticed the mileage on the car was in excess of 9,000 miles it had been sold to me with a mileage of just over 3,000. This was both on Aututrader and Inchcape’s website - photos of speedometer. I rang the deleardhip and agreed a £700 refund to be credited to my account, within 5 days. I agreed to this although, 5 days is excessive in today’s electronic transfer capabilities, bearing in mind the car had been paid for within 2 hours of receipt of invoice.
Suffice to say, still no refund, messages left at dealership and unsurprisingly no contact.
Extremely poor service from a large national dealer.
Looking forward to your response ....and the refund....and the key.


Within two hours of posting this review, Sean the BM returned my call! The refund was actioned immediately and the spare key was in the post. Sean explained that the key may need to be recoded at our local MB dealership, but they would obviously refund us this cost and that there would be no delay like this time.
You can guess, key arrived, need recoding, took it to local dealer, sent copy of invoice (which we had obviously paid), two weeks on -still no money from Inchcape. Have rung, emailed twice-“refund will be done ASAP”,still nothing. Still terrible."
2018-11-15,3,Was not happy with the fact i was told that you could not visual check the cam belt. I took your report to the person who has looked after my cars for years (this is the first time he has seen this car as i have not had it very long) it took him about 3 mins to do a visual check on the cam belt.
2018-11-15,5,"Excellent service from start to finish! I was kept updated from day 1, I was also so happy when I recieved a phone call to let me know my car was ready a full month earlier. Alex Clubley was the gentleman who looked after my sale & his customer service could not be faulted. I would be more than happy to buy from Mercedes-Benz Liverpool again."
2018-11-15,1,"AVOID THIS PLACE. Service, attitude and cleanness just goes out the window. Had a service which was told it will be 2 hours so I waited and brought my laptop with me. When booking, the lady on the phone said they have a business centre. I thought ohhh fantastic, when I got to the 'business centre' it was nothing like how i expected it to be, (a bit like mercedes) but it was a white uncleaned desk with stained walls, holes in the walls, there was dirt and rubbish everywhere. The coffee machine didn't work. Initially she over charged me by £82 then when questioned she reduced straight away.

One of the workers there started telling me off as I parked in the wrong place. I told him your parking had been blocked off by an abandoned car and was causing a major issue as nobody could move so I found a spot to park and I did. Much to my delight he started talking to me in a rude manner. 3 BMW works came out to see what issue was, found out about the car, and just walked straight back in.

They have no care for customers or respect. I brought all this up to 2 people and just tried convincing me that they are too busy. Not my problems it's your managers. The word sorry or we apologies tasted quite bitter so they didn't bother saying it.

Overall it took 5 and half hours to service my car, when originally said 2."
2018-11-14,5,Easy car service booking online. Friendly and welcoming staff. Kept me informed of the car’s progress throughout. Provided video for car health check before commencing the work. The car needed parts which were hugely expensive but the work was done on the same day. Very efficient. Would use again.
2018-11-14,5,"I was very happy with the service and courtesy shown , the salesman Adrian Hart was not trying the hard sell and was very knowledgeable about the car.i felt comfortable throughout my visit and very happy with the car i was sold.i hope the aftersales will live up to the same great standard of professionalism."
2018-11-14,5,"Good online booking, efficient and effective service team. All went to plan and loved the video from the service team too."
2018-11-14,2,"Happy to deal with you pleasantly enough when buying, but the experience deteriorates when holes appear further down the line. Do all your research first and be very thorough, rather than rely on what you are told; Inchcape are unwilling to point out where you may be wasting your money with incompatible options. Strangely, during a warranty repair on my 4 month old car, someone felt the need to change the stored setting on my driver's seat position to as close to the dashboard as it would go. Rather uncomfortable for my 6'1"" frame. Petty behaviour and ridiculous enough to impact the rating."
2018-11-14,5,It was my first time using cooper Cobham and I’m very happy with the service they provided! Henry the service advisor is brilliant and def knows his BMW’s. Look forward to the next visit.
2018-11-14,4,Friendly staff very accommodating
2018-11-14,4,"would have given 5 stars, unfortunately, the fact that i called three times before i got an answer to see if my car was ready, pressed the correct No for service dept and each time the message was repeated twice then when the call was put through it rang forever then rang off!
But i must say the service from inside reception etc was wonderful, all the staff i spoke with were really helpful, just had a problem with the phone side of things."
2018-11-14,1,"worst experience ever Inchcape oxford after sale service worst then Russian Lada.brand new E class all-electric system failure dangerous to drive and on three occasions refused to give a courtesy car. The dishonest engineer sent me text car s fixed but not at all gave me a dangerous car back to drive. Engine cut off of in fast lane twice. Took two months to fix the car.
sales lady Anne Evans done her best to help me she sold me the car and she provides very good service but the engineer was very arrogant he had no clue. So if you buy from this dealership if something goes wrong then expect no help from workshop engineers in Inchcape oxford. Phillips tyres. Singh"
2018-11-14,5,Excellent service professional staff
2018-11-14,4,"Car in for service so decided to wait until completed.

Arrived slightly ahead of schedule but was looked after by service reception and offered coffee.

Comfortable surroundings and service completed broadly in line with what I was originally told when making the appointment."
2018-11-14,1,"Before I booked my car into MB for replacing 2 new tyres, I enquired how long it would take. I was given the answer ""about 45 minutes"". I arranged to take my car into the Chester branch yesterday at 9.30am. When I arrived, I was welcomed by the ladies on reception and offered a cup of coffee. At 11.15 I enquired as to how long the car would be. At 11.25 I was informed the car was ready.
I did actually ask why it had taken 2 hours to complete a job I was told was going to take 45 minutes, and although the young lady apologised profusely and told me I shouldn't have been told it would take only 45 minutes to complete.
I am due to have the other 2 tyres replaced in a couple of months, and I will reconsider whether to give the work to MB as I have much better things to do with my lure than wait about in an MB showroom for half a day."
2018-11-14,5,"Excellent service. Kept informed, car collected and returned and expertly washed and valeted. Staff are very courteous and helpful. No complaints whatsoever. many thanks."
2018-11-14,5,Efficient and friendly!

2018-11-14,2,"My car was booked in to Cooper BMW in Thames Ditton to fix a headlight problemamong other things which started in April.

Picked up the car and the problem started again.Have called twice to speak with service and was told someone would contact me and I am still waiting.

Will be contacting Inchcape head office and then if still no response BMW!"
2018-11-14,1,"I bought Mercedes E350D 2016 from Mercedes Liverpool about 2 months ago. 16k on the clock, manufacturer approved. On the way home I noticed that the car starts to vibrate when I press the brakes. I contacted Mercedes Liverpool and they said that I need to go to the nearest Mercedes and fix it and they will cover all costs. I paid £1200 to change brake pads and discs and rear alloy wheel. Mercedes-Benz of Liverpool did not pay me anything, they keep saying my different stories. They said that they already sent money into my account, then they said that they issued check 2 weeks ago, then they said they need to get an approval from head office and so on. When I contacted Mercedes Customer Service, they replied to me saying that Mercedes-Benz of Liverpool had already paid me by the check so I had to go back to Liverpool to confirm that but they said: no we are still getting an approval from head office… They lie to me every time I contact about my money or simply answer that manager is away or off today."
2018-11-14,5,"Catia Was excellent - the hand over was excellent, well looked after, Thank You !"
2018-11-14,5,Team at BMW are very informative and helpful both pre and post visit. The video from the technician is a nice touch
2018-11-14,5,"Inchcape Preston is a huge site, made human by the helpful and welcoming staff. They understood my requirements completely and our contact, Alan Wood, went out of his way to find the right vehicle for me. His after sales care has been first rate. Having dealt with the previous Jaguar dealerships in Preston for many years I’m confident that Inchcape will continue in the traditions of Jaguar in providing first rate vehicles and service in the future and I would recommend this dealership to anyone."
2018-11-13,5,Fantastic service - very thoughtful sales rep; Clare was great and kept me up to date with news of my new car.

2018-11-13,5,"Really good experience, start to finish. No messing around, honest and did things when they said they would! I found the team accommodating from start to finish."
2018-11-13,5,Had my car serviced while I waited. From first entering the showroom to departure the staff demonstrated great professionalism
2018-11-13,5,"Helpful, efficient and friendly service. Would thoroughly recommend"
2018-11-13,5,Car picked up at home and delivered back valeted all in a highly efficient manner.
2018-11-13,5,"Booked in for major service and mot, friendly welcome on arrival from reception and then James. Issue with tyre, James promptly phoned me and all was taken care of; received video feedback of inspection, video clear but audio low. Service sheet is headed as ""Minor service Operation List""? James assures me that it is ok and a Major service was performed, will have to wait until next service to see if I'm challenged for not keeping my car in top performance. Nothing but good service from the Chelmsford team."
2018-11-13,5,"Very good, no problems."
2018-11-13,5,"Excellent service. Agreed an early inspection date, identified the problem quickly, quoted for the repair and completed the work same day."
2018-11-13,4,"Very good customer service, car came back with a lovey valet after having a service. Loved the health check video.

Only negative was the wait, it took 2.5 hours."
2018-11-12,3,"I was there because it was a recall. It would be good if I did not have to have my wife follow me to give me a lift home and again to collect the car.
If I had my car fixed within say two hours I would have worked on my computer in the reception area, but it was not possible. I deposited the car at 9.30 and returned to collect it at 2.30 3.00 pm."
2018-11-12,3,"Was offered a loan car and naively expected like for like. I had never had a loan car before. I was given the keys but not told it was manual gearbox or told anything about the car.
I would have liked to have been told that I would need to request an automatic at the time of booking as I was not confident driving a manual which would’ve reduced the trauma of having to drive an unfamiliar car.
As my car was then being kept overnight eventually the car was replaced with an automatic. Had this been available at the start there would’ve been no stress."
2018-11-12,5,First time I've used Inchcape Warrington and the service was excellent. I really felt looked after.
2018-11-12,5,"Purchased a Evoque in November 2018. Salesman was John Hill - very good communications, helpful and straight forward to deal with. Recommended."
2018-11-12,3,"I bought the car over the weekend, on Saturday the 10th November 2018. Started off good with Glen looking after me reasonably well. He was courteous and respectful during my time. However, I did have to phone 4 times the following day after my purchase to chase up Glen regarding a couple of issues with the car. I left messages with one guy who obviously didn't like working on a Sunday and 2 other female members of staff but nobody got back. I called again at around 3.50pm and managed to speak to Glen who answered the phone. I told him about the 2 issues with the car and that he was going to phone me today, Monday, to update me. Alas, I didn't get a call or an email. I guess I will have to contact them again tomorrow to chase it. Not very impressed with a Mercedes Main Dealerships' Service at the moment. I won't tell the world yet until I see what the outcome is regarding my Sat Nav not working and a cover missing from the electric wiring on the driver's side. Come on guys, this lack of communication is very irritating, to say the least."
2018-11-12,5,"Staff always polite and helpful. Very grateful for the free health check otherwise I would not have know about the crack in my Alloy wheel, as is on the inside of the wheel rim. Was given name and address of repair specialists."
2018-11-12,5,great product good people
2018-11-12,5,A very good service
2018-11-12,5,"Very friendly and no pressure to buy environment. Overall a very good dealership which I would go back to.
David the salesman was very patient and helpful along with the general manger Sam who made our buying process very smooth.👌"
2018-11-12,5,"Excellent service , no hassle , no issues and no pressure sales. Friendly staff and would highly recommend."
2018-11-12,5,Very good and helpful staff nothing to much trouble
2018-11-12,3,Whilst staff come across as approachable and friendly their failure to deliver is a disappointment. Promised as I believe others were on the day that my car would be cleaned before being handed back to me. Not the case and I feel this was not the first time this has happened and was the main reason I stopped using the garage. Only chose it because of the recall on the wiring loom. Customer service!!
2018-11-12,5,"Staff were very attentive and kept me informed of progress while I waited.
Excellent service."
2018-11-12,5,"The service from start to finish of this purchase for our Mini Countryman from Coopers Teesside Mini was excellent.
A special mention for Adiel, Becky and Sam who were instrumental in completing the deal.
Would not hesitate in recommending this company and the team who dealt with us."
2018-11-12,5,"Helpful, Friendly, Professional Staff. Couldn`t be more happy with the service I was given."
2018-11-12,5,"i Picked up my car from Inchcape Saturday after only seeing pictures and videos which Craig had kindly sent me, The Car was in imperfect condition, Craig was fantastic from the beginning when speaking to him after seeing the car online through to the end of sale, i felt very looked after, And even after I brought the car home, Craig called me the next day to see how u was getting on with car and kindly talked me through how to set up the phone app, I’m so glad I came across Inchcape after having a bad experience with Strastone"
2018-11-12,4,"BMW Cobham were generally very friendly and efficient and the staff encountered were very helpful and good to deal with.
The only friction --to use your word --related to waiting 20 minutes after paying my bill for my car to be cleaned and be ready to drive off. This meant that I left the garage about 60 minutes after having been advised by email that my car had been serviced and was ready for collection. This was not a big deal but seemed out of keeping with the excellent service overall."
2018-11-12,5,Excellent service. Would definitely be purchasing again from Inchcape.
2018-11-12,3,Booked in for a recall job that was to take 1 hour but had to wait 2 1/2 hours !!.
2018-11-12,5,"Went in to service my vehicle ..
Upon entering the building you are greated with a warm welcome by the receptionist.
The service team, Adam in particular was very helpful polite and understanding credit to the company .
Any thing that my vehicle needed other than what it went in for was reported to me via video link brilliant impressive well done Bmw"
2018-11-12,5,Great service
2018-11-12,5,"Pleasantly surprised at level of service surrounding MOT which included collection and return of vehicle, cleaning of car inside and out and provision of video covering health check."
2018-11-12,5,"Great experience, just the right level of interaction.. not too intrusive.

Phil has done a great job"
2018-11-12,5,Very good and 5* service recommended
2018-11-12,3,"OK, where do I start.
Staff - Very polite, efficient, knew their product knowledge so very easy and pleasurable to deal with.
Showroom - Ok so they were about to relocate to brand new premises so it was understandable there were a few cracks here and there in the old building eg the gents restroom was out of order but I am sure the new premises will be gleaming.
Vehicle - I travelled 60 miles to get the exact car I wanted. Unfortunately there was zero fuel in the tank so I had to wait an hour for fuel to be sourced so I could have a test drive. Other than that the vehicle was fine and now sits on my driveway.
I don't normally take out finance when purchasing a new car, however I opted to take finance simply to take advantage of a further £1500 discount but with the intention of paying off the finance later that week at nil cost.
Sadly the member of staff responsible for completing and forwarding the finance agreement was off sick and it wasn't processed until later the following week. Due to this delay I was charged interest on the agreement than had otherwise been the case. Unfortunate but there we are.
Conclusion - Would I buy a Jag again? So far yes without question.
Would I use Inchcape Chester again? Yes in a heart beat.
The issues highlighted are at worst annoying but I have rarely made a significant purchase anywhere without some small hic-cup so Inchcape are a good company doing a good job."
2018-11-12,1,"truly shocking customer service, no leadership or management the organisation of the checking in checking out process for a service is an awful experience - not to be repeated and would certainly explore for other alternatives ... not what you're used to for a BMW dealership"
2018-11-11,5,"Service made easy, no complications and excellent customer service too."
2018-11-11,5,Excellent service. Salesman - Anthony Kelly was excellent supported by his Manager Nick.
2018-11-11,3,"Purchased a lovely Mini Cooper S . Happy with the sales process, price, warrenty etc. However we had asked about a few small defects and were promisied the car would look immaculate after being prepared for sale. The car had dog hairs in it and grime in the leather creases. Rusty 12v charger hadnt been replaced as promised and windscreen chips not repaired. Still waiting for the phone call from management we were promised. After sales service has been poor."
2018-11-10,5,Professional and friendly
2018-11-10,5,"Gave fair price for my part exchange, replied quickly to my internet enquiry.
Salesman (Billy) was fantastic and did not give the “Hard Sell” for products I didn’t want which was refreshing.
Great Experience and delighted with the car."
2018-11-10,5,"Fantastic service from molly and dean with my focus tdci st from the swindon branch today with my first ever hire purchase, helped my understand by explaining in great detail and made me feel at ease, would highly reccommend this branch to anyone and would definately think about buying from here again"
2018-11-10,5,"Instantly attended to on arrival, everythng explained, service, cost etc
.Work completed, communcation excellent, very happy with this dealership."
2018-11-10,1,"I booked in my BMW for the 12th October for a service and to have a repair carried out as a tail gate control unit had been removed at the last service because fluid had got into it . I contested that this should be covered under warranty as it must be a design flaw that the unit was so exposed to spillage, as it is situated under the boot space where shopping would usually be carried, but I got no joy.

Having taken a day off work I was telephoned the night before to say that the computer system had been down all day and therefore my repair would not be done and could I leave the car over the weekend. I said yes as along as I could have a courtesy car. I was disappointed to be told that there were none available, so my only course of action was to book another date , the 25th October.

On arriving I was told that there was a recall put for some cooler issues but as there were a number of engineers on a course (6 as I recall) there was no guarantee that the service, the tailgate repair and the recall work could be carried out in in a day and could I leave the car (I was there at 8.00am). Again I said yes as long as I could have a courtesy car but again unbelievably there were none available. We agreed that I would leave the car and that as much as could be done in a day would be done. Why I couldn't have been told this in advance I don't know as I presume the course was booked some time previously? There is a problem with the process and communication somewhere.

I received a call and returned that evening to pick up the car as I was told that the cooler issue did not render my car dangerous so it could be done another time. I was left waiting for nearly 40 minutes until I was seen and then told that the tail gate issue had not been fixed as I had ordered a new motor rather than a control unit. Furthermore I was asked to pay for the motor as the engineer has taken out the working one and replaced it!! I refused point blank as I couldn't believe that even if there had been a mistake on ordering parts that an engineer would not test the motor and not notice the control unit was not there, as it had been removed at the last service and should be on the service history.

It was agreed that I would not have to pay for the motor but that still left me with a whopping £691 bill for a service and having taken two days off work I was still without a working automatic tail gate .

This is my first BMW and I bought it because I thought it would be a quality build and I would receive a quality service. How wrong was I. I was not offered any sort of compensation other than the chap I dealt with saying he would talk to his manager to see if there was some way I could get some recompense when the tail gate control unit was fitted. Not surprisingly I have had no contact from the service centre at Cobham.

I ask that someone contacts me to provide a free fitting of the unit to go some way to making up for my two wasted days and poor service.

I wish I could attach the picture I took of the notice in the centre that states in big bold letters on the wall

Our commitment to CUSTOMER SATISFACTION means that ""VERY SATISFIED"" isn't good enough. For us only ""COMPLETELY SATISFIED"" will do."
2018-11-09,5,Excellent friendly service.
2018-11-09,5,We had a lovely sales man. He gave us 100% attention. Helped us with every thing. Kept us up to date.
2018-11-09,5,"Very helpful staff and clearly explained to me. Took time to explain the controls etc in the car.
Will definitely recommend the garage to friends."
2018-11-09,5,"Great service this week from Phil at Cheshire Oaks Audi. Friendly, and comprehensive review of the work carried out. Thanks."
2018-11-09,5,there are always many mercedes at inchcape motors at cheshire oaks so you have plenty of choice the sales staff are very good when you go to purchase a car and will give a fair price for your old car
2018-11-09,5,"This is the second car I have bought at Cooper York and once again the service was impeccable! I was given a very fair part exchange deal for my old Countryman against a fabulous Mini Countryman S. Absolutely love it! All the sales staff were very friendly and helpful, and the whole process was made as painless as possible."
2018-11-09,5,"Took in our leased VW Polo to Inchcape for a service and MOT. Seriously they could not have been more helpful. From the initial welcome from the front desk at reception to Jack who looked after us so well from there on in. We were informed that an expensive item that needed changing due to the length of time we had had the car didn't need doing, so we were very happy with this exemplary service."
2018-11-09,5,"Great service by Demi, had a car ready for me to use whilst work was being carried out, handled my additional request for SatNav upgrade efficiently and was there to greet me when I came back to collect. Fantastic service!"
2018-11-09,5,"Great service, no complaints in that department but by god you certainly pay for it."
2018-11-09,5,"Brought my car in for a recall. Staff very pleasant and informative, evening making me a coffee while I waited which I appreciated. Pleasant surroundings while waiting. The only think I did find I believe needs a look at was the gents toilet. I had to flush the lever twice because it was very loose, difficult to get soap out of the container and the hand dryer was, I thought, extremely cold so took quite a while to dry my hands. Everything first rate."
2018-11-09,5,"Fantastic customer care. I was warmly welcomed by Becky before being taken through the service process. Becky explained exactly what work was to be carried out, and answered all the queries I had. An all round pleasant experience"
2018-11-09,5,"Very helpful staff, very good service experience, I will be back."
2018-11-09,5,From start to finish customer service and communications were absolutely fantastic !
2018-11-09,5,"Had to take my car in on a safety recall I found the Audi staff very helpful from start to finish nothing was too much trouble, they were all very friendly and kept me well informed throughout - excellent service."
2018-11-09,3,"Car service on the day was great - car was ready when promised, clean and work clearly explained.

The booking arrangement was however impersonal - I got put through to a central booking office who was not familiar with the local garage's processes. I was promised a return phone call, but nothing materialized.

Coopers might also consider offering a more comprehensive lift service beyond Reading town center, now that they are not located on a bus route."
2018-11-09,1,Had a B service and spent over £700 and they did not even wash the car
2018-11-09,5,"Fantastic service from Michael while buying my pre-loved BMW. Calling from London, Michael was extraordinarily responsive and helpful, even coming in on his day off to complete the transaction, having picked me up from the station ! There was also no pressure or sales patter, just an honest and accommodating interaction. Many thanks for, probably, the best service I have had whilst buying a car !!"
2018-11-09,5,"Fast, friendly, reasonably priced and efficient repair of my Mini with the added bonus of it being returned to me all shiny and clean. Very happy with the whole experience."
2018-11-09,4,Good service
2018-11-08,4,Booked my 6 series in for service at short notice. Dealer was excellent throughout. Would recommend.
2018-11-08,5,The service department is excellent the sales department beyond poor except car wow
2018-11-08,4,Great overall service and polite/ professional reception and service staff. Liked the video from the vehicle check engineer. Disappointed in the valeting inside and outside - could have been much better.
2018-11-08,3,I had an A/c service and now the A/C is switched off and I cannot get it back on. Also my data screen is blank and again I do not know what to do to get it functioning
2018-11-08,5,Best service I have ever received thank you will be coming again
2018-11-08,5,"Excellent! Friendly and professional service!
Great people to deal with."
2018-11-08,1,"This place is so bad it's almost comical. Incompetence on a spectacular level combined with rudeness and ignorance to an extent I've rarely encountered anytime, anywhere. I feel sorry for the one or two employees who have tried hard to provide a decent service in very difficult circumstances. Avoid.

UPDATE
I emailed Inchcape as requested on 9 November with further details and have today (10 December) received a reply. Their reply states that they have been reviewing my case and asks if it has now been resolved. As this is the first I've heard from them I've asked:
1. What, precisely, have they done to review my case?
2. What conclusions have they drawn from their review of my case?
3. What actions have they taken as a result of their review?"
2018-11-08,4,"Very good sales experience. Attentive, knowledgeable and customer focussed without being pushy. Delivered to our door. Delighted with the vehicle."
2018-11-08,3,Pleasant enough visit although the £29.99 winter health check promised a free windscreen protector but it was not available as the Nottingham garage hadn't been supplied with them by whoever was meant to supply them. Good customer service would have taken your details and forwarded one on to you when available but alas....
2018-11-08,5,"Friendly staff, a courtesy car and service completed with no fuss. Very good, as always."
2018-11-08,4,"Friendly service
Clean place
Happy with experience"
2018-11-08,5,"Really great service from Adam Parsons at Cooper BMW Teesside. I came from London to Teesside for the quality car, at a reasonable price, delivered with excellent customer care. I would come again next time too. 5 hour drive home? Worth it. Thanks so much for a fab car that my fiance to be likes as much as I do. I already don't know what I'd do without it. The whole family and giant German Shepherd Dog 'Saint', love it. We'll go far in it. Thanks again, Barry Ashton, Hammersmith, London"
2018-11-08,5,First Class service throughout and work completed on time .
2018-11-08,5,"Kings Lynn Branch - fantastic service from start to finish, Richard is a credit to this company and I would highly recommend anyone to this branch and him. Best service I have ever encountered and I never really write reviews!"
2018-11-08,4,"Had to wait a while longer for car to be dropped off (1/2 hr) than I do at dealerships with other vehicles I have (5 minutes is more typical) where you are seen to straight away but staff were friendly and helpful.

Bit disappointing a two year old car needed parts replacing under warranty though) as I haven't had that with other marques I have owned from new but the car was fixed and ready for collection 8 hrs later and I was given a courtesy car - though I was asked if I REALLY needed it ""as there were not enough and some customers were going to be disappointed that day"" according to service personnel."
2018-11-08,5,"Good initial contact, excellent after-sales, nothing too much trouble and no over-enthusistic sales technique either"
2018-11-08,5,"Received excellent service on 6 /11/18
Given a lift into York
Staff very polite and helpful
Car was ready before the allotted time
Having had a good service clean and vac
Thankyou
Tracy Oldridge"
2018-11-07,1,Poor customer service. They took nearly 7 hours to provide an estimate for the repair.
2018-11-07,4,Generally have reservations about major regional motor franchises but have to say in the 2-3 times I've visited this new site in Cheshire Oaks I've been very pleased. The people are helpful and friendly and unlike some locations they have ample parking and space around the building for customers.
2018-11-07,5,"Excellent service great customer care again
Couldn’t ask for anything more ."
2018-11-07,5,"Past experience was a bit hit and miss , but service has now much improved, thank you ."
2018-11-07,5,Helpful staff and friendly atmosphere.
2018-11-07,5,"Friendly staff, fast service and nice tea and biscuits while you wait."
2018-11-07,1,"When registering for the service, the person couldn't log in to their system. At pickup, the person in charge of service wasn't at her desk and nobody knew where she was. After finding her, the instructions given to another member of staff as to where the keys for the car were inadequate as they couldn't find them. I was then told she was in another part of the building and to wait for her. 20 minutes later she emerged and put out walked me back to the other part of the building to get me my keys. She did apologise at that point. When I got in the car, the tyre pressure notification that was there when I dropped the car in for service came back up on the dashboard so I'm not sure how good the service actually was."
2018-11-07,5,"Gareth Hardy did an excellent job , everything went smoothly from quote to picking up the new car"
2018-11-07,5,Superb experience from start to finish
2018-11-07,5,Excellent service from all personnel. The job was a major service and MOT inspection which enabled me to take advantage of the customer lounge and coffee facilities.
2018-11-07,1,"I have never had reason to question the service provided by your Workshop Technicians, however following the latest service carried out on my Vehicle, GLC 250D, which I view as a beautiful machine I did have reason to question the account where it stated that 20 litres of Adblue had been used and charged for to the sum of £24 + VAT. Upon questioning the service receptionist the abuse which I received left an awful lot to be desired.

As a company we use Adblue within some of our tractors and it was myself who filled the Adblue Tank on the car due to the fact that an indicator had shown it needed topping up. This procedure was carried out the weekend prior to the vehicle being serviced therefore with this to the fore if the vehicle needed a further quantity of Adblue within a period of days it is my opinion there must be a major problem which is in need of rectification.

The question of cost is insignificant, it is my view a matter of principle. It may have been better that a schedule of proposed works be discussed prior to any operations taking place.

To conclude if it be your wish that I take my business to alternative supplier, please advise accordingly.

2018-11-07,5,My car was serviced under a drop and collect agreement in two hours. On arrival we were greeted by the receptionist who offered us beverages while we waited for her to organize a service adviser to see us. We were made aware of the scope of work to be completed on the vehicle and offered a complimentary wash and valet also. The car was ready on our return to the dealership looking pristine. A copy of the vehicle health check was provided and gone through with us. We were offered beverages again while we waited to settle the bill with the service adviser. All the staff there that I dealt with I found be very friendly and efficient
2018-11-07,3,"Booking a service was pretty poor. Not that obliging. Can’t believe they don’t offer a collect and return service on a first service as they said it only takes 45 minutes, my wife was there 2 hours. Been having our cars serviced with these for years, may have to think again. I must say the girl who looked after my wife once there was excellent."
2018-11-06,5,"I cannot recommend Cooper BMW Cobham highly enough! I went into their showroom to see if I can exchange my car for a new BMW. They looked after me very well, in a friendly and professional manner. There was never any sense of pressure. In the end I went home with an excellent deal on a shiny new car.
Special thanks to Jamie for making it happen! Thank you very much."
2018-11-06,5,We were impressed with Andrew Ball after our daughter bought her Range Rover from him and we decided to get a price for ourselves. Finding a person knowledgeable and accommodating without being pushy helped us to decide we wanted to purchase a Discovery Sport. We also met Chris who was very professional too.
2018-11-06,5,"Dealt with Phil in new car sales (although I kept calling him Paul) I can honestly say I couldn’t of been dealt with in a more polite and professional way. Nothing was to much trouble for Phil. I gave Phil my requirements and budget which he did his absolute best to meet.
From the first phone call to a couple of test drives to doing a deal that met my needs was conducted in my opinion to the highest possible standard.
I have nothing but praise for Phil and I can guarantee that I will not hesitate in doing business with him again when I need to change my car.
Many many thanks for all your help Phil
Regards
Robert"
2018-11-06,5,This was the first time I used Inchcape Toyota and I was very impressed with the customer service. Very friendly and helpful staff. Definitely would use again.
2018-11-06,5,"Fast, No fuss, free coffee!"
2018-11-06,5,"I was really well looked after by Adam at Cooper BMW, so well in fact that this will be my first port of call when I change cars in the future.1st class customer service."
2018-11-06,5,"Great service,great staff and great loan car.Couldnt ask for more !!👍👍"
2018-11-06,5,Very efficient and great customer service. Thank you.
2018-11-06,4,"The Service Reception is not very warm or friendly. You seem to have to wait to be called forward to speak to a receptionist, but they often don't even acknowledge your presence and give all their attention to the computers on their desk.
Once you get passed Service Reception the facilities in the waiting area are very good and the actual work carried out on your car seems to be top class - such a shame that the initial welcome is very poor."
2018-11-06,5,"Brilliant friendly service Laurence was great to deal with no messing about, will definitely be going back."
2018-11-06,3,"Despite signposting a serious problem, the service department carried out the safety recall work only and claimed to be too busy to look at it, necessitating rebooking for another day and general all round inconvenience. Is a bit lean if there is no slack in the calendar to investigate faults, especially when advised at the point of booking."
2018-11-06,5,Very good efficient service. All the staff is very competent.
2018-11-06,5,I have just bought an Approved Used Car from BMW Thames Ditton and was impressed by the professionalism of the salesman with whom I dealt. He was/is excellent.
2018-11-06,4,"Very good service from my initial visit to the collection of my car. Asif was very helpful the whole way through the process.
I just love my new Mini. Thank you.😀"
2018-11-06,5,"Tried several Audi dealers and Hyde is without doubt the very best. Really personal ,sincere service, did exactly what was required on time with really friendly team at the garage. I would not hesitate to recommend them."
2018-11-06,5,"I recently purchased a Golf GTD from an independent supplier and wanted a dealership service and water pump/cambelt change. I took it to Inchcape VW Swindon and they were fantastic!!! They were very welcoming, the showroom is impressive and their staff are excellent. They also dropped me off back at work and picked me up again. The car was returned serviced, washed and vacuumed, the health check was videoed and the work carried out, well itemised. It is true you pay more at a dealership, but for the added peace of mind, outstanding customer service and the feel-good factor, it is worth it and great value for money. They have a new, loyal customer now."
2018-11-06,4,"Good service! Everything done as promised.
Valet could have been a little better but not a major problem.
Overall very good."
2018-11-06,5,The whole process was easy - from booking to the service itself. The staff are always helpful.
2018-11-06,3,Cooper Reading have well priced cars but they change the prices from day to day without changing the advertised price - even the one on the car. So beware of that. Once they agreed to honour the advertised price things were a lot more straightforward...
2018-11-06,4,"BMW Cobham have an impressive range of vehicles on site, it’s a friendly and helpful organisation, with a feel of being a family run business.
We were greeted within minutes of walking through the door by one of the sales team, Brian Sheridan, he wasn’t pushy or sales oriented in any way and said he was here to match the right car to the right person, his priorities were for us to walk out the doors happy, content and with the correct information to make a good and educated choice of what car we would be happy with.
His knowledge of all the vehicles was vast and wide, it seems that we had the same love for the same cars, when we were younger, so I really thought I could trust his unbiased opinion, when he was helping us choose.
The BMW X4 caught our eye and within minutes, and he arranged for a colleague to take us out on a test drive.
It was love at first sight, the drive was incredible, the build quality, second to none, so we decided to purchase the car.
We were given options for finance which was incredibly easy to understand, Brian also advised us on extra warranty cover, car protection and asset gap protection, this basically covered every eventuality with regards to the car being written off to being stolen, a great idea and a policy which we took.
None of these products were forced onto us, they were just friendly suggestions to help us get the best from what BMW Cobham has to offer.
In conclusion, a great car dealership, a family atmosphere and quality merchandise.
Thank you Brian Sheridan for all your time and enthusiasm, you made it look easily.
Also a big thank you to all the staff, who made us feel welcome and relaxed."
2018-11-06,4,Very efficient and staff extremely helpful

2018-11-05,5,"Inchcape Land Rover derby and sales executive David Orme provided a first class, stress free and enjoyable experience of buying our Range Rover.

2018-11-05,5,"Excellent dealer, our salesman (Marc) was courteous, helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the cars he had for sale. We were impressed by the effort they made when we collected the car - we were made to feel special!"
2018-11-05,5,My experience with Mini was enhanced by having Ian Kelly as my salesperson. He is approachable and very knowledgeable about the cars. He has also been very helpful with the after sales care of the car as well. 5 stars!
2018-11-05,4,Friendly reception. Work carried out efficiently. Yet to assess all that was done but confident all is ok. The video health check was a surprise but useful. A wash and Hoover was also a surprise.
2018-11-05,2,"I’ve used Inchcape for about the past two years, and had exceptional service from them, up until my last visit. On my last visit I found the service adviser very unfriendly, and to listen to her on the phone you’d have though my car was unroadworthy, and a death trap. This was a shock to me, as it did pass its MOT on this occasion, but there was still so many things wrong with it. Seems to me as trying too much for the hard sell, and then going in the huff when you don’t buy. Won’t be using them again, which is a shame, as the workshop technicians are great."
2018-11-05,5,"Having bought our first VW, a Polo for my wife, a couple of years ago from the VW dealership in Altrincham I decided to get a new Golf for myself from the same place. The reasons were twofold: I have been very impressed with the quality and performance of my wife's Polo, which I really enjoy driving so I knew that the Golf would be at least as good, as well as a definite step up from my (very good) Toyota Auris. Also we both liked James Porter, the sales executive who sold us my wife's Polo, because of his low-key, professional approach: friendly, without pressure and helpful in choosing the right car for our needs and not a more expensive option. In addition James gave me a very good deal."
2018-11-05,5,Above and beyond! Denise came in early (before opening hours) especially to meet me so I could drop of my keys and go onto an appointment. She did this with no fuss and to my amazement was still there when I cam back at the end of the day to collect the car. She was very efficient and updated me throughout the day on the service progress. Swindon isn't my nearest garage but with that level of service I will definitely head back there next time. Many thanks your efforts were very much appreciated.
2018-11-05,5,"Old world service very rarely seen in this modern age. Polite, informative and nothing was too much trouble."
2018-11-05,3,"Provided the car for 24hours to allow for first service and an adjustment to the boot operation Went to collect on the Saturday morning, waited an hour before service advisor appeared He said car ready went to the car ,it was dirty I suspected nothing had been done. After it was cleaned found could open the car,but the mirrors did not fold out. That was sorted, arrived home the info screen stated the car needed a service !
Rang straight away was advised someone would respond, nothing until I rang on Monday. Have to go back again again tomorrow, who knows !!
The centre is excellent people are friendly and helpful _ but at the end of the day, they should be able to do the first service on my car since I bought it from them"
2018-11-05,5,Excellent service at short notice
2018-11-05,5,"Very happy with the service, staff were very polite and friendly Car was booked in for an Mot and health check, no issues, would recommend Swindon Audi"
2018-11-05,5,"Our purchase of a GLC 250d started off as speculative interest in a car that we liked the look of when seen out on the road. Previous to this we have purchased a number of BMWs. After looking at the car at Inchcape we decided to enquire about it not knowing if we needed to book an appointment. This did not appear necessary as we were introduced to Aaron who took us through the cars specification and allowed us a long test drive to get to know the vehicle.
Our part exchange was priced very favourably and we left as very interested would be purchasers.
We had a prior appointment with the BMW dealership that sold us our X1 and they were not able to match the Mercedes deal without two days haggling over an X3. This then left us with a decision to make.
We were very pleased with the service at Inchcape and after more research were keen to try out a different brand to our previous vehicles. The GLC 250d is definitely a step up in comfort and prestige and has some radical functionality improvements over the X3.
We have really enjoyed our first weekend with the car and believe it will serve us exceptionally well.
Thanks to Aaron and Inchcape at Stratford upon Avon"
2018-11-05,3,"Booked up a specific time (14.00) for an MOT & wash and vac,
I turned up 10 minutes early to ensure a prompt start. At 15.15 I had to chase to get a progress update and was advised that the MOT was just being completed. At 15.40 the vehicle was finally available to me and I was late for a subsequent appointment.
Coffee was offered to me on several occasions, and it good.
The dealer facilities were modern, bright and clean. Customer toilets are available.
Shame they wasted some of my time & I cost a lot more than mechanic."
2018-11-05,5,"Inchcape Toyota Nottingham - I got my car here and continue to bring it in for services. This year as always, the experience was flawless. Angie is a pleasure to deal with and she can't do enough for you - even offering me a coffee to take with me on my trip into town whilst waiting for my car! The video of the check was really useful and a nice touch. I needed some new tires for winter and even though I was expecting them this year, it was still nice to get a call to explain why I needed them before giving the go ahead. To top it all off, my car was lovely and shiny when I picked it up. Not a streak in sight either, I really need to get the details of the products used as I can never get it so spotless! All in all, a brilliant experience worth paying a little bit more for."
2018-11-05,5,"Have visited Cooper Tonbridge a few times over the last few months. Experience has always been really positive. Picked up my new car on Saturday and am really happy. I went to at least 3 other mini showrooms before buying here - each time put off pushy, arrogant sales people who weren’t actually listening to what I was saying! Scott was patient, helpful and knowledgeable - and importantly, not pushy. Would recommended 100%."
2018-11-05,5,Customer service by James Hedley was first Class. Car returned on time and well presented.
2018-11-05,4,"The car has been well looked after but I am disappointed that the service plan I bought for the car was not recognised properly by other branches, resulting in us having to pay for the service and then get a refund.
The lack of joined up thinking for a big company such as Inchcape is not great."
2018-11-05,5,Very happy! Staff is friendly and helpful! Great service overall!
2018-11-05,4,"Excellent sales service, fantastic after sales service as well. And the car is perfect, exactly as ordered and delivered ahead of schedule. The only gripe I have is that the receptionists take far too long to answer the phone. Something which the people I spoke to inside the building told me it’s excellent sale service, fantastic after sales service as well. And the car is perfect, exactly as ordered and delivered ahead of schedule. The only crime I have is that the receptionists take far too long to answer the phone. Something which the people I spoke to inside the building told me is a regular problem."
2018-11-05,5,"Couldn't fault the service at all. Fantastic customer service from Clive before, during and after purchase. I would recommend without a doubt and definitely purchase from here again. Thanks for all your help Clive, I love my new car! - Sian Allen"
2018-11-04,5,I rate inchcape Preston 5 stars because the salesperson I dealt with mr Allan wood was brilliant.at no time was I under pressure to buy his knowledge of the car (Range Rover sport) was excellent.i would certainly recomend this company.
2018-11-03,1,"Shocking service from Carl the principal dealer. Hasn't taken care of my issue and complaint. Being the manager he isn't running this dealership with customers in mind. He forgets who the customer is.

I am waiting for a refund on a hired car that I am entitled to and Carl is ignoring all my calls and emails.

Not a prestige garage at all and Mercedes are just going down hill. How can Mercedes give a franchises to such a terrible company?

(I have already numerous times contacted you and you have not helped. Your reply is terrible and doesnt mean anything. So pick send me what is owed to me )"
2018-11-03,3,Initially I found an unreasonable approach to something I needed doing but ultimately they did sort it out.
2018-11-03,4,No issues with the warranty check. A professional and polite service. Thank you
2018-11-03,5,"Went in for 30 point complimentary check, brake defect was detected, work was carried out within a few hours, informative video of the check was sent to me via e mail"
2018-11-03,5,ALWAYS EXCELLENT SERVICE WITH PERSONAL CONTACT AT ALL TIMES
2018-11-02,4,Straight forward to agree the deal and then followed through with good service during the delivery process.
2018-11-02,4,"Excellent salesman who was courteous and professional, who handled my part exchange and purchase effortlessly. I will however, have to express a certain amount of disappointment with the standard of ‘valet’ on the car I purchased. It simply was nowhere near the standard I set myself let alone a prestige vehicle marque. The interior was at best a ‘once over’ clean, with the rear window being nothing short of filthy inside!"
2018-11-02,5,"I travel 44 miles round trip to get my car MOT and Services at Inchcape Toyota in Nottingham..
Excellent team here and 7 years I have been coming... never had any problems whatsoever..

I particularly appreciated the time taken to understand issues when handing over keys and for the time taken to explain findings and make recommendations upon completion"
2018-11-02,5,"Very helpful staff, with great service"
2018-11-02,5,"Had a very good car buying experience at Lexus Nottingham. Following the disappointment of missing out on purchasing a car at Lexus Derby, (the car I expected to view had already been sold), Lexus transported me to Lexus Nottingham. I was met by Dean Jones, Sales Specialist, who had a car ready for viewing and test driving. Dean handled the purchase very efficiently. Took care of all the required paperwork and had me on the road in no time at all."
2018-11-02,5,Very helpful staff who look after you
2018-11-02,5,Fantastic service
2018-11-02,5,"My car required a minor repair to part of the the internal trim.
Twickenham Volkswagen did a great job - keeping me fully informed and going the extra mile to complete the job on time!
Many thanks to Bal Sahib and the team for excellent service!"
2018-11-02,5,Really great service and customer service excellent! All questions answered well and the car we got was exceptional!! A really good price for our old car too...fantastic experience and will definitely go back when we look at a new car again. Thanks Cooper BMW!!
2018-11-02,5,"Service was brief, punctual and complete. I had no problems with it and will be going back next year."
2018-11-02,5,Very impressive first visit for VW annual service and MOT. Very efficient and friendly service from start to finish. I will certainly return there in the future.
2018-11-02,3,James the technician and engineer was very thorough in looking at my car! He assured me that everything was working fine but unfortunately as soon as I went to use the satnav multimedia player in my car it would not work and then I had to take it back in the next day and it was looked at again and the multimedia player was replaced and still it doesn’t work!
2018-11-02,5,I was extremely happy with my treatment and the work done on my vehicle at BMW Reading. An excellent service
2018-11-02,5,"Very good service recovery after appalling experience.
Service agent Mica at Croydon was kind enough to help me throughout.
Well done to team Croydon.
Looking forward to see you guys soon.

Yousaf"
2018-11-02,5,Great experience in terms of what to expect from a dealership. Complimentary car clean was appreciated too. Would thoroughly recommend.
2018-11-02,5,"Booking was easy. Car service completed on time and car washed and hovered. Liked the video on vehicle check.
Comfortable lounge to wait with coffee machine etc."
2018-11-02,5,"An excellent company who are keen to promote customer service as their priority. The car was as described on autotrader and the prompt, professional approach enabled me to have an enjoyable experience."
2018-11-02,5,"All together a lovely experience. The staff were friendly, helpful & very informative. I would definitely recommend Inchcape but more importantly I would be happy to use them again."
2018-11-02,5,"It was a very nice experience buying from Inchcape. The Sales Exec, Wayne Hadden, was extremely good, during the whole process, order, payment and hand-over. We never felt pressurised and all requests were handled quickly and professionally. More importantly we were kept informed throughout of the status and progress of the car.
Malcolm N"
2018-11-02,5,Excellent! From the start the salesmen were helpful. It made our choice easier. Especially Jay. Would definitely recommend them to family and friends. Thank you all.
2018-11-02,4,Excellent service from start to finish. Responded quickly to all questions leading up to the collection of our car.
2018-11-02,5,Looked after car and myself very well .
2018-11-01,5,"Really great staff, very helpful, knowledgeable and not pushy!! Recommend these guys highly, I drove 65 miles to buy my car and wouldn't go anywhere else for a fantastic deal from Mercedes ( ask for Alan)"
2018-11-01,5,Salesman lan Smith was polite honest and although it was at the end of the working day had plenty of time to show me the features of my new car - top man.
2018-11-01,5,I have been very impressed with Louis especially at Inchcape LandroverPreston in helping me find the exact car I was looking for. He is very professional and I feel he is a real asset to the business. I have dealt with a few car dealers and he is by far one of the best . I highly recommend purchasing a vechile from Louis and at Inchcape Landrover Preston. Big thanks to his manager Neil to who has helped with the process to.
2018-11-01,4,Very friendly and pleasant approach to sales
2018-11-01,5,"From communication about the test drive to the point of driving away with a new car, the service and professionalism from all concerned was exceptional.
Not my closest BMW dealership but I would recommend to anyone without hesitation, it was worth travelling the extra distance."
2018-11-01,3,"Only one Receptionist on duty when I took car in for service and she was dealing with phone calls which caused some delay.
Then further delay in waiting to see someone to discuss service arrangements and a warranty issue over which I received short shrift but which I intend pursuing.
Courtesy car petrol warning indicator came on within minutes of leaving the dealer.
Collected car after dark and only realised the following day what a bad job they had made of the promised car wash.
As a previous Audi owner of many years my Mercedes experience thus far has been underwhelming."
2018-11-01,3,Normally my experience at Merc Warringtpn has always been good but this time it was not I took my car for device and had to wait 35 mins before I was seen I had pre ordered a courtesy car which was provided It was filthy dirty outside and keep giving messages like Needs water I for windscreen and Needs a litre of oil on next stop Not what I needed
2018-11-01,5,Very helpful and informative staff. Purchase was straightforward.
2018-11-01,5,"From entering the showroom the staff were very polite and courteous at all times.they took me over to the service reception and introduced me to Rachel Morris who then did the paperwork and transferred it to the workshop, she also made me a coffee while I waited for the job to be done.The technician made a video but it would have been nice to have been shown the Old cable which he was replacing,as it would have been further proof of the job being done if I decided to sell the vehicle."
2018-11-01,5,"Five ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ Are for Paul who checked my mini in and looked after me very well. He was very attentive and helpful. I can’t fault his service which was five star.

Sadly, only one ⭐️ for the service department. My complaint was that my vehicle was booked in for a while you wait MOT and a free health check and courtesy car wash. I arrived before 8am and my car was not ready until 10.45am. A MOT takes 45 minutes and even with the extras I shouldn’t have been waiting for 3 hours! Poor Paul kept checking on me and made me coffee but I wouldn’t have booked a WUW to be left sat for 3 hours. Plus usually the car is cleaned exceptionally well, my car wasn’t dirty on arrival but when I picked it up my front windscreen was all smeared and difficult to see out when the sun shone on it! To be honest I’ve had better service with Coopers and if it wasn’t for Paul being attentive and trying to hurry my car up I would’ve complained on site. Please ensure a car is worked on and returned quickly during a while you wait booking. No one should sit for 3 hours for a MOT! Thank you"
2018-11-01,3,"Usual experience when part exchanging at BMW, it's like a little game nit picking to drive down your part ex valuation. It's not much different whichever dealership you go to. On the plus side, the two salesmen that dealt with us were very professional and very friendly, follow up call today from Kevin, told him the nearside mirror is broken, also two of the discs have a lip on them!, got a voucher for the Mot, when it's due, that's a new one on me, usually the car comes with a new 12 month mot, maybe if they had done it they would have seen that the brake discs need attention. I have been assured that the faults will be rectified asap, we shall see. Well I have owned the car for a week now, despite being assured that someone would call me to arrange to rectify the faults NO phone call."
2018-11-01,4,"Good experience getting my Mercedes serviced for the first time although it took longer than the estimated time of 1.5 hours, was more like 3 hours in the end. Not a problem to me as I was able to walk into town from there. A video was sent through to me of the car being serviced which was a useful touch. There is no personalised meet & greet on arrival like at the Audi garage and the guy that looked after me didn't smile much. Nice having my car washed & vacuumed although the dashboard and seats weren't cleaned and still looked dusty & grubby which was a shame."
2018-11-01,5,"Great experience, would highly recommend"
2018-11-01,5,Receptionist Jordyn a great example of how to deal with customers quickly and efficiently. Well done.
2018-11-01,5,"Received my car back, serviced, pristine clean with everything explained by a ver helpful Service Advisor [Ben] and then got a really comprehensive video relating to work carried out by Kieran the technician.
Great service, really friendly people. Would recommend."
2018-11-01,5,"Mark in vehicle servicing was friendly and professional, listening to my concerns, not solely about the service but also future implications for the MOT. After the vehicle service, besides the paper report, I was also given/sent a short video with the BMW technician physically showing, with a commentary on the status of said areas - Mark then reviewed the inspection with me, in relation to the MOT. Above and beyond."
2018-11-01,3,"The service had been booked for a number of days but when i attended I asked to check the software on the media head. This was not done due to a link problem to Mercedes.
It was reported by the technician that there was an issue which a tire valve dust cap being seized on to the valve. I managed to release the valve cap within 20 seconds of trying at home. Simple releasing oil was all it took."
2018-11-01,5,"Very helpful sales people. Whenever I booked in for an appointment or test drive they always met me on time.

Had the pleasure of two test drives with no issues needing a second. They also fully understood some personal matters that caused complications in taking delivery of the car and came up with numerous ways to make it easier for me."
2018-11-01,5,"Absolutely brilliant, can’t fault it!"
2018-11-01,4,"Staff as always are well presented, pleasant and helpful. Think it would be better if car could be dropped off without having to wait. Would have preferred a faster way of paying after completion of the work."
2018-11-01,5,"I had a great transaction with Adam, one of the used and approved sales representatives. He was quick to pick up my initial inquiry and get back on the phone to me and had videos of the car I was interested in sent to me the next day ahead of my appointment to test drive the car. During my visit I felt welcome and Adam made sure I have a relaxed time to look at the car and made sure I had a long and comprehensive test drive at a variety of roads to get a good feel for the car. In the end I bought the car and I am really happy with it. If you are looking for a good service ask for Adam"
2018-11-01,5,"I took my car in to be serviced on 31 October at Cooper Malton. As I needed a car for a day I was given a hire car. Everything was efficiently arranged, and I returned the car at the end of the day having being advised by email that my car was ready to collect. All went smoothly and I was very impressed with the whole event."
2018-11-01,5,"What a pleasurable experience buying a car from Cooper BMW Reading.

The person who looked after me was Adnan Yasin. He was a very patient and spent the time to understand my needs. He came up with a number of options and did not find at any time been pushed into buying a car. Also when we visited the showroom we were felt very welcomed and the staff there would come up to you if to ask if they could be of assistance or was someone looking after us. Unlike my experience with other BMW dealerships.

Even though this dealership is not the closest to me, certainly going back there when I need to renew my car."
2018-11-01,3,"Great that they picked up and returned my car - in for a first service. They washed the car but dint vacuum the interior - All my previous services with other garages included this. They also did not check the tyre pressures. Surely this would be a thing to do as part of a service.
I will look to use a different BMW garage in the future as i now wonder what other things they didn't do.
They shared a 30 second video of the car - the underneath. No commentary and I gained no benefit from it."
2018-11-01,5,Cannot fault the dealership as everyone was very helpful. The hand over was excellent and I appreciated the time I was given.
2018-11-01,5,"Rachel at Coopers BMW Durham exceeded our expectations firstly by explaining which service we would need for our car and quickly worked out what the costs would be before work started. As we both needed to work, Rachel found us a quiet area in the show room which was perfect. We had asked for 'fast track' service and that was exactly what we got... the car was finished an hour before we thought it would be. All in all, exceptional service, customer care and workmanship. Thank you very much indeed"
2018-11-01,5,"Very pleasant experience on the past two occasions, very friendly and helpful staff."
2018-11-01,5,Very good personalised service
2018-11-01,5,"What a splendid experience for something as mundane as a car service.

Welcomed by Mandy.
Offered a cup of tea.

Service was completed and paperwork presented in a posh folder.

But best of all was the video of tyres and brakes.

A quality experience all round."
2018-11-01,5,Very professional service. Met at the door and welcome coffee supplied.
2018-11-01,5,"The staff and technicians are all very pleasant and accommodating.
They were very helpful getting the vehicle I chose to the standard I was looking for.

I would recommend to use this company for buying their vehicles."
2018-11-01,5,"Upon my first visit to Mercedes Nottingham, I was greeted by a pleasant young lady on the front desk who informed me that someone would see me shrotly.

I was then greeted by Pete, who is a used car salesman. I knew what car I wanted to look at and we had a chat on the way. I quickly established that Pete was an approachable, polite and genuine guy. We exchanged details and arranged a test drive. Pete was very accommodating with this as my working hours are often awkward.

I arrived for the test drive and was quickly greeted by Pete after a short wait at the front desk. The car was fuelled up and ready to go. The drive was awesome and Pete answers any and every question I threw at him. If there was anything he wasn’t 100% sure on, he was certain to find out before answering me. When we arrived back at the dealership, we searched for a car and eventually, after some digging around in the system, we found one that had just arrived on site. I viewed it and although I wasn’t sure on the colour at first, the specification was spot on and it was meant to be. I put a deposit down there and then, just to mull it overnight. I soon decided that it was definitely the one I wanted. I emailed Pete and he was quick to reply to get the ball rolling to complete the purchase. Pete informed me of an issue with a tyre on the car a day or so later and he was apologetic but it delayed the process by a couple of days.

Collection day. I walked in and I was early by about 25 minutes, I had a drink in the lounge and waited for my allocated time and then Pete appeared, looking professional as always with all the relevant paperwork. We had a good chat and was offered all the extra cover and protections offered by Mercedes, during this time, Pete wasn’t pushy, although he highly recommended the products and added in his own experience using some of them, he didn’t push me into anything. We competed and went out to the car that where Pete explained all the features of the car and made sure I was comfortable before leaving the dealership.

Throughout the whole process at Mercedes-Benz Nottingham, I had mainly dealt with Pete, other than the ladies on the front desk, Nathan and Adam from the service department. Pete never failed to answer a question fully and give a more than satisfactory answer. Pete was very through in everything he did from the details about the cost of road funding, to quadruple checking the amounts he entered for the sale to the explanation of the features on the car. I fully recommend Pete for anyone wanting to purchase an approved used Mercedes-Benz from Nottingham. An open and honest guy with a the right approach to selling cars.

All the best,

2018-11-01,4,"First experience of using Audi Tetbury for servicing and I was very happy with the experience. Professional, patient and helpful."
2018-11-01,4,"Another good experience at Inchcape VW. We were well received and made comfortable with a coffee whilst we waited for the car to be booked in. The minor service was undertaken speedily, yet thoroughly and I was able to make my lunchtime appointment. The video report on the car was very thorough and clearly explained. Very professional. I had a detailed discussion on the phone prior to collecting the car, which had been washed and vacced prior to collection. The car is twelve years old and the representative was understanding on that point when discussing possible future work. The only point to detract from the experience was the neigh on impossible parking position and the very small parking bay size. The garage plot is tiny - far too small for what is required and as such, the customer experience is somewhat compromised. For best practice on this point visit Williams BMW at Bolton. Lots of parking and spacious bays."
2018-11-01,5,"A very pleasurable experience buying my E class cabriolet.Alan who sold me the vehicle went out of his way to be helpfull,promptly returning my calls and did everything I asked of him,including picking me up from Southport railway station. Very happy to recommend."

2018-10-31,4,"Sales executive sourced the vehicle I required and had it ready on the date I wanted to collect. Paperwork was easy, some waiting around but there are worse places to wait than a luxury car showroom with complimentary soft drinks, coffee and biscuits."
2018-10-31,5,Charles was really helpful and found the best car for us
2018-10-31,5,Lovely service from Adam and Alvin. Incredibly quick turnaround to meet my needs. Very pleased with the car and the service.
2018-10-31,5,All of the staff were friendly and very helpful
2018-10-31,5,"I have visited a few luxury car show rooms in searching for a new car, and researched brands and cars quite extensively. In short its difficult to fault Lexus - the build quality is excellent - which is becoming increasingly important, given the enormous amount of tech on luxury cars. Also, Lexus Guildford really valued me as a customer, and were centered on a positive experience, recognising this would a big purchase for me. I couldn't be more pleased with the product and the service."
2018-10-31,5,"A Safety recall.

All very professional and even cleaned the car inside & out"
2018-10-31,5,"Cooper BMW at Durham is the place to go if you want a BMW. The staff are friendly and one could add that Alan Birks a member of staff who recently dealt with my latest purchase made the entire procedure a friendly and comfortable experience.
Well done to all"
2018-10-31,5,"Great experience
We were met on arrival by Martin Collins who listened to what we wanted and quickly arranged a test drive.
We discussed the various options and decided on the model we wanted.
Martin looked after us really well and we are very happy with the car.
I would recommend Inchcape Preston and will certainly go there in future."
2018-10-31,1,"They carried out a repair to my X3 radiator under warranty. After the repair I noticed my heating wasn’t working, which I informed them about. It was decided to leave it until I have the car serviced. While the car was in for the service I got a call to say the problem was there wasn’t enough gas in the A.C system which they would do for £85. After complaining to the service manager the fee was removed. When I collected the car I was informed the problem was too much gas in the A.C . So today, the day after yesterday’s performance the A.C nor the heating are working properly . So another day without my car."
2018-10-31,5,"Edward and all the other staff were professional, courteous and efficient. The whole purchase process was straightforward and the price was excellent. Thank you."
2018-10-31,5,Excellent experience
2018-10-30,5,"Excellent service from Inchcape as expected from the collection to delivery back to my home. Good video of the inspection/service with the safety issues all clearly highlighted, and the chap that collects and delivers the car is ever so polite and friendly - good ambassador for VW and Inchcape."
2018-10-30,5,Totally smooth experience. Listened to what I was looking for and offered me a great deal. Everyone I encountered was friendly and professional
2018-10-30,4,Found them to be very helpful.. The sales agent who dealt with me was very good and kept me well informed of the progress of my purchase.
2018-10-30,5,"Very good service and very friendly staff i will see them on my car next MOT & next SERVICE.
Recommended to all."
2018-10-30,5,Service booked online with ease followed by hassle free drop off and collection in the timescale booked.
2018-10-30,5,"I couldn’t recommend Cooper Cobham Mini highly enough, thoroughly professional and polite service throughout the car buying process.
Special thanks to Alexander Dann who kept me informed and updated throughout."
2018-10-30,1,"In my quest for a used car, my experience with Mercedes Benz Warrington left a lot to be desired. Firstly, I chose a car via the website and tentatively arranged to travel down from Edinburgh to collect it the following weekend, with the finance all completed remotely. On the Friday prior to my trip on the Saturday I was informed that there was an issue with the car's V5C due to a cherished plate not having been transferred off. There was some to-ing and fro-ing through the following week with again no joy and the trip on the Saturday was again aborted. During a conversation with the salesman Ben Davenport, I decided to opt for another similar car in stock within the group. This was duly sourced and scheduled to be prepared for Monday 29th. It transpired that there was a problem with the locking nut on a wheel so that halted proceedings, unfortunately by then I had arrived to pick it up. An arrangement to fix the issue at my local Mercedes dealership was then mooted which meant I could take the car away that day. I signed the paperwork and then had a ridiculously extended wait whilst the finance company paid Inchcape. This eventually completed by around 18.30. I attempted to pay the balance by card which failed on several occasions and it seems that Worldpay were at fault. There were two other clients stuck in the same predicament, unable to complete payment and were waiting for a loan car. Eventually at 20.30 a loan car was arranged for me and I made my way back north and got home some 13 hours after setting off to pick up the car. Overall a totally distressing day with a lot of sitting around drinking tea and with zero achievement. I must add that I found it entirely unbelievable that Inchcape do not have a plan B in place to fall back on in the event of their means of accepting payment falling over, I would politely suggest that this single point of failure needs to be addressed with some urgency. I'm sure Mercedes Benz stipulate that their dealers must have a Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Place in place, clearly this falls somewhat short of the accepted norm. Finally I have to say that Ben Davenport has conducted himself very well in the face of adversity and tried manfully to assist and mitigate each disaster as they arose, he is also delivering the car to me on the 31st Oct and completing the handover personally, which is much appreciated. That is of course we don't have a further calamity,"
2018-10-30,2,"When booking my car in for a service I was told I could wait as would be a couple of hours at the most, I sat there for over 4 hours, I was told it would be a little longer due to them cleaning my car for me, might as well not bothered as it was filthy"
2018-10-30,5,"Excellent service, quicker than anticipated completion"
2018-10-30,5,"Having passed my driving test in 2009 i haven’t driven since 2012. Circumstances have dictated that i need a car for my new job and i couldn’t be happier going with Mercedes-Benz, Leicester.

Henry Barre understood my needs and provided me with great customer service. He took the time to understand my position, my budget and my situation. The service from the initial meeting to post-purchase has been fantastic. He went beyond what i had expected and i cannot recommend him highly enough."
2018-10-30,4,"The CHR was in for a routine recall. I was supplied with an Aigo for the day and the work was carried out within the day as suggested . On collection the car had been washed and vacuumed. The staff were all friendly,helpful and attentive. Nice work,thankyou"
2018-10-30,5,very polite and helpful
2018-10-30,5,Dealt with promptly and efficiently
2018-10-30,5,"Love my new 3 series.

Hannah was always very polite and helpful and also responded to any questions I had very quickly.

I’ve already recommended her to a friend who’s interested in buying a new car."
2018-10-30,5,Excellent service from start to finish. Thank you Emma and Nicola.
2018-10-30,5,Great staff. Fantastic service
2018-10-30,2,"Punctual service, however staff were not as warm and welcoming as other Mercedes branches. The impression of quantity (volume of customers) over quality of service was given. Car was not cleaned to an acceptable standard, boot was left dirty and inside was not cleaned properly. Service itself appeared to be through and complete."
2018-10-30,5,Excellent service provided by Paul Ridett in the service team and the technician who looked at my car. Both very helpful and explained the issues and provided a solution
2018-10-30,2,"Honestly... I expected more from a prestige brand. I wanted my partner to have a BMW because her finance was up for renewal soon and I have always thought of them as a reliable sturdy car.
As we entered the dealership we were eventually greeted by a sales exec who we gave an abundance of information too about the spec of the car we wanted, the gearbox, the engine and even the colour. I couldn't have made things simpler. However we went back and forward between what stock he had and what options we deemed worth extra along with availability and monthly payments.
At no point were we offered a test drive of this 37 grand car and no real rapport building ever took place, it was all about can we get these people a car and can they afford it.
When we were trying to achieve our monthly payment in the end the sales exec kept disappearing to the business manager to get further discount, would have been much easier if he had of come out of his office and present the figures transparently to us, this eventually happened but after the sales exec seeing him 3 times and before we was about to walk out.
The only reason we ended up purchasing a car from here is because it was cheaper than another dealership by 12 a month, othwrwise I would have taken my business elsewhere ."
2018-10-30,5,"Travelled up to Inchcape Preston to receive my new car. Was extremely impressed with the facility. From the time of arrival was looked after very well, greeted with coffee and a very warm welcome.

The car was inside ready for viewing and collection. It was a pleasure dealing with Scott. Explained everything to me very clearly, even if I probably didn’t listen as was too excited getting my car.

Great facility at Preston and great service. Definitely recommend Inchcape to others."
2018-10-30,5,I’d just like to express my appreciation for the outstanding sales service Asif Ansari provided us. He ensured that the process was as easy as it could be for my daughter and I. He really did cater to our thorough specifications. We will most definitely return to Mini Croydon in the future!
2018-10-30,5,"Francis Reed made the whole process very easy, straightforward and efficient. Very pleased with the level of service and attention to detail."
2018-10-30,5,"Fantastic service all round. Sales staff very informative, knowledgeable and most importantly not pushy in any way. In these days of 100% glitz and glamour show rooms the customer and the deal are often neglected, not here though."
2018-10-30,5,"Very good service, friendly and very welcoming! Taking my brothers car soon as he has problems with his TT.

Reassuring to go to a trustworthy place, especially when I love my car.

Thank you!"
2018-10-30,5,From start to finish the service from all of staff was excellent and definitely go back in future
2018-10-29,5,"First class service, great cars and good value, well looked after by Mark and a thoroughly positive experience."
2018-10-29,5,"Cooper BMW Durham, friendly efficient first class service. Technician even phoned the previous day to discuss and determine the exact problem. The problem was fixed next day and explained afterwards."
2018-10-29,5,"We have now purchased 3 cars, across a number of years, from Coopers Mini and BMW in Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells. The service is always brilliant, the staff are very helpful and polite. They go the extra mile and always follow up as promised in all areas from sales through to servicing. As part of a large dealership group, they have an extensive selection of cars immediately available, which is very appealing."
2018-10-29,5,"Craig, was very helpful and professional. We particularly liked the non pushy approach."
2018-10-29,5,Perfect customer care. Strongly recommend
2018-10-29,5,My car was unfortunately delayed for 3 months but Inchcape Guildford kept me informed and were very good to get the car out to me as soon as they could- including the salesman coming in on his day off. Great service! (Thanks Ray!) Just feel a bit let down by Jaguar and their delays.
2018-10-29,5,excellent friendly service
2018-10-29,5,Lovely staff and quick service.
2018-10-29,5,Excellent service. Adam was terrific
2018-10-29,5,"Last week we bought a new BMW X2. The customer care was excellent, they kept us appraised of the schedule for collecting the new car and guided us through the detailed paperwork. In addition they ensured we could adapt to the amazing technology provided in this new car. They made sure that all the DVLA procedures worked seamlessly and we were able to leave with the number plate of our choice.
The post-purchase care has been exemplary."
2018-10-29,5,Very good service and communication outstanding would highly recommended

2018-10-29,1,"Inchcape Toyota Sandhurst.
Absolute rubbish, they can't even wash a car, how are they supposed to service it.
They scratched my nearly new Hilux all over at its first service, looked like someone washed it with a brick rather than a sponge.
Tried talking to them about it and they claim; no that was probably like that from new, it's like that on all cars from the factory you see, all we did was take the wax off so you could see it! Yeah right, of course, absolute rubbish! Sub par outfit!"
2018-10-29,5,Friendly staff and efficient service. 🙂
2018-10-29,3,Lexus Guildford great service of vehicle and on time but unfortunately poor Valeting service car was started but chap went to lunch and i was sitting waiting so they got somebody else to finish then I had to finish off when I got home.

Car washed and returned.
Only niggle seem to reset all settings in trip computer
Otherwise happy with service"

2018-10-29,3,"Team did not return call after two attempts ,when I booked the service I was told that it would take about 45 mins ,after 2 hours I phoned the service desk to get an estimate of how long it would take ,I called twice and was told everyone was busy at the time of the call and that someone would call me , which they did not,i stayed in Cobham for a while longer and then l returned home ,"
2018-10-29,5,I couldn’t of ask for a nice man to help me with the purchase of the car. Nick was so helpful with the Passover. I’ve never had anyone explain so much about the car it was superb.
2018-10-29,5,Great treatment!
2018-10-29,5,Great service from Simon who went out of his way to ensure everything went as smoothly as possible when collecting our new cars.
2018-10-29,5,"I received excellent customer care when purchasing my car from Mercedes Liverpool.
I didn’t feel pressured, I felt that Joe Obrian who was dealing with me was fantastic and went above and beyond for me and also Jon the manager. The day I picked my car up was amazing they really did pull all the stop out which made the handover a day both me and my family won’t forget especially my son who was delighted. Since purchasing my car I have spoken with joe Who has assured me that should I have any questions not to hesitate in calling him, I can’t recommend both him and Jon enough they are a fantastic asset to Mercedes. I’ve dealt with sales people for years with cars and have never had this quality of care and such fantastic experience."
2018-10-29,5,"Great. Turned up on the time stated to pick the car up and dropped off at the time stated, also very friendly and helpful"
2018-10-29,5,"Great Service from Peter and Noel there. Moved mountains to deliver what I needed and cannot fault them.

A good job all round."
2018-10-29,5,Fantastic service from Chris Perryment. From start to finish it could not have been easier.
2018-10-29,5,I enjoyed my experience at bmw cooper very much I believe they offer the best service and are second to none. Staff were friendly and helpful most of all they gave me a very honest experience. I would recommend this place to anyone.
2018-10-29,5,"My car was booked in for a service and I was looked after by Laura.

I found that Laura was attentive and communicated well and surpassed my expectations. I don't often write reviews, but felt the need to leave a recommendation to her and all the Staff at Cooper Chelmsford.

Many thanks"
2018-10-29,5,"Cooper BMW York, gave me the best experience I have had in buying a car. I rang them to enquire about a car that I had seen advertised on their website but unfortunately it had been sold. I was asked by Stephen Robson (used car sales manager) what my budget was and he said that he would find me my car of choice, which was a BMW 630d GT xDrive. Within 3 days, I had secured the car I wanted, in fact, a lot more than the car I wanted because it was loaded with extras that I had not considered and half the mileage I expected. Stephen had kept me informed all the way via e-mail because the car was being bought from a distance. I had not seen any pictures of the car and bought it purely on the trust of Stephen. When I collected the car last Saturday, I was absolutely delighted with it and the service that I received from all of the staff that I had contact with. My experience of this dealer is truly 5 STAR!!"
2018-10-29,1,"My car was collected from my work address by a Mercedes representative, who performed a documented Visual Health Check of the car, which was then driven to their Warrington Inchcape workshop for a service. The service was completed and then the car was driven by the Mercedes representative back to my work address.

Upon inspection, the car had suffered damage in the form of 6 dents on the front of the car, which appear to be a mix of stone chips and other more significant damage. This damage was sustained during the time the car was in the possession of Mercedes Warrington Inchcape.

I contacted Mercedes Warrington Inchcape and reported the problem, and sent in photographic evidence, at their request. After two days of unreturned phone calls, I managed to hold for the Service Manager who reluctantly took my call because he ""was too busy"". The Service Manager abruptly told me that ""he wasn't going to pay for the damage as they are stone chips.""

Despite me advising the Service Manager that the damage was incurred during the period in which they had my car and that the documented Visual Health Check performed by the Mercedes representative of the car prior to his collection proved this, the Service Manager refused to accept liability for the damage.

The Service Manager was rude, abhorrent and unreasonable.

I would advise against using Mercedes Warrington Inchcape."
2018-10-29,5,"This is my 1st BMW and so this is the first time my car has been in to BMW Teesside. The service was excellent and the service advisor was very helpful. A pleasurable, no hassle experience and my car was even returned clean."
2018-10-29,5,"Excellent standard of service from start to finish. All the staff at Inchcape are friendly, efficient and nothing is too much trouble."
2018-10-29,1,"I bought a BMW from BMW Croydon and i received the worst customer service I've seen in a long time. I complained about the service and I've escalated my complain with no reply whatsoever. Inchcape will ask you to write to write to them at @tellmomore....don't bother, it's a waste of time.
Best to stay away."
2018-10-29,2,"Yet another half arsed service from Mercedes Coventry. I booked my car in for a service giving three weeks notice and was also explicit that there were two further faults that needed sorting - auto windscreen wipers needed re-calibrating after my screen was replaced, and the steering wheel adjustment no longer worked. Needless to say, the car was serviced but the additional work was only 'confirmed' with a requirement to return the car for these works to be completed. This is not the first time, indeed it has become a boring and inconvenient regularity."
2018-10-28,4,Professional friendly service. Straight forward disscussions. provided good communications from start to vehicle collection and follow up
2018-10-28,5,I have always wanted a BMW and Coopers especially Christina made the whole buying process very simple. And the car is everything I expected it to be
2018-10-28,5,"After one nightmare of dealing with mercedes of Warrington l contacted Mercedes-Benz of Liverpool and spoke to Brian Sutton and made him aware that I had seen a car of interest based in Nottingham, Brian straight away told me if I was interested in the car he would have the car transported to Liverpool so I could view the car.when the car arrived Brian promptly called me and invited me for a viewing after meeting Brian his customer care was totally professional he made feel at ease his knowledge of the car and what I was looking for was very impressive. Brian then let me take the car for a test drive and on are return we sat and talked he told what he could do and what he couldn't do so straight away we both knew were we stood if anyone is thinking of buying a mercedes-Benz car go to Liverpool and ask for Brian Sutton he will provide you with car you're looking for and he will not make false promises. Don't go to Warrington a total waste of time the sale representative made false claims and kept on disappearing to get answers and when I asked to speak to the manager would not make himself available."
2018-10-28,5,High degree of Patience and Professionalism.
2018-10-28,3,"No problem with Sales staff who were knowledgeable and helpful. However, trying to get hold of someone from Service department to answer a query proved impossible. In the end I rang Mini Croydon and got an instant answer."
2018-10-28,5,Ollie and Alex who dealt with the sale were very professional throughout which made for a relaxing and non pressured buying experience.
2018-10-27,5,Great service friendly staff definitely recommend
2018-10-27,5,I found the experience of buying my first Mercedes car to be excellent. The salesman was extremely helpful and I am delighted with my purchase.
2018-10-27,5,"Seen to promptly and professionally, car was ready when they said it would be, even slightly cheaper than quoted."
2018-10-27,2,"My car has now been at Romford VW twice and I feel like my time has been completed wasted.

The first time on the 12th Oct I dropped it off at 9am and was told it would be done by 5. At 4:30 I chased what was happening to be told it would be late. This is unacceptable as I have a young baby and was reliant on a lift back to VW. I was informed the car did not go In till late as they were busy. This is not my problem and I feel like if I had said I needed the car back at a certain time it would have been done earlier. I regretted instantly being accommodating.

The second time on the 25th Oct it went in I had a courtesy car and was called approx 10/10:30 to be told they couldn’t fix the problem and I needed to sort out the windscreen. I am angry as this could have been dealt with on the first visit. I was also told that even if it just needed recalibration it would have to go to the Chelmsford branch anyway - this again would have been a complete waste of my time and I should never have been booked into Romford the first or second time.

To top it off the car was apparently ‘cleaned’. If you call cleaned hosing down the car I really don’t see the point. The car had water drops that dried all over it including the windows - I actually had to stop to clean the window as the sun made it difficult to see. The car was cleaner before it went in!

Ryan was the person dealing with me and was always very polite and apologetic but this experience has been unacceptable. I have heard bad things about Romford VW and I can now see why.

I was going to put in a complaint but then saw you asked for a review."
2018-10-27,5,"Hi, I have dealt with Cooper York for a long time and as always having recently had my car serviced all the staff were very helpful & pleasant. My car was returned to me about two hours later looking spotless having been washed and valeted. I can fully recommend Cooper York for your motoring requirements."
2018-10-27,5,Staff are friendly and always have time to answer question and feed you with coffee in all a good experiance
2018-10-27,1,"Really disappointing experience, though I will say not in keeping with the normal. Not everything was Dow, but the struggled to get response from my ‘appointed person’. 8 days later I still have things outstanding and they aren’t scheduled for another 5 days."
2018-10-26,2,"Went to see the car in the rain and was told any paintwork defects would be sorted, this was done on major areas but when finally inspecting the car in good conditions after taken delivery found quite a few areas that had not been sorted. For a car that was only 10 months old was very disappointed. Would not use them again, all they seemed interested in was selling additional insurance packages."
2018-10-26,5,"My M3 was due a brake fluid service while I was away on business.Popped into Coopers on the off chance that they could do it,not expecting them too because of the short notice.Left the car with them at 14:30,they rang me at 16:30 saying it was done!! Also sent me a video with it up the ramps being prepped for the job! Fantastic service and the staff were really helpful and friendly"
2018-10-26,5,Excellent service
2018-10-26,5,"helpful, happy staff. Job done"
2018-10-26,4,"The initial negotiation stage was rather awkward/stressful with misunderstanding but once matters were resolved, the completion stage and picking up the car was an absolute delight. Our Sales Manager Torrin couldn't have made it more special for us. He was patient, explaining all the intricate bells & whistles the car had with clarity and encouraged questions. Business Manager Alan was also most helpful on the finance aspects and was both professional and affable. It was our first Mercedes and a lifetime's ambition for me. Since aged about 4 I have always wanted a Mercedes. Torrin seemed to genuinely enjoy and engage in our experience. Touches like the video prior to arrival; the car in the showroom; it covered; the board notice and of course the unveiling made it so, so special and I relished every minute. Torrin continued to be helpful and patient with us after we arrived home with our lovely car, answering many questions and making himself available for any type of query."
2018-10-26,5,"Really great service every time I need anything. This time I went for an MOT and BMW were really accommodating with booking me in and my changes in dates, the service throughout was great, and I’d recommend them anytime!"
2018-10-26,5,Great customer service. Prompt pick up & return. Im impressed with the video of my car test. Overall nice experience.
2018-10-26,5,"Buying a car isn't always a great experience - especially if you hate being 'sold to' by a high pressure sales person anxious to meet their monthly target - but the team at Jaguar/Inchcape in Chester have got it right. So right.

Indeed, their only anxiety seems to be in making sure that you get the right car for you - and that you're happy.

We were.

In fact, we weren't just happy, we were delighted.

And still are."
2018-10-26,5,This is the second vehicle we have purchased from mini Teesside with David. It has been fantastic from start to finish and we have felt welcome and been kept in formed throughout the whole process. I am very happy with my mini. Thank you very much.
2018-10-26,2,"Well, I’m on my 3rd Mercedes so I’m clearly a fan of the brand, and usually the customer experience. My car is two years old, and has only covered 13000 miles. At the time of booking it in for a service I was quoted £436......which I questioned and complained about ...that’s a lot of money for a service which was only made more complicated by the need to change the brake fluid....at the same time I mentioned a fault with the start stop system, which had ceased to work a short while earlier. I was advised over the phone that it was probably a battery fault and the car was booked in for the whole day for it to be investigated as well as serviced. A courtesy car was provided. After being informed that my car was ready for collection, I returned to the dealership at 4pm .....I was told that the car had had a new battery fitted and had been serviced. I asked to speak with the service manager regarding the service cost. I was told that he was busy for about 30 minutes if I wanted to hang on or he would phone me to discuss the matter. I then left to return home. Within half a mile, it was obvious that the fault with the start stop system still existed. I continued home to await a call from the service manager. Unfortunately this call never came. The following day, I was obliged to phone the dealership myself. I reported the continuing fault with my car and asked just what had been done to fix it. I was then told that no new battery had been fitted as they had had to order one .....I enquired when they thought they would have informed me of this .....I have a new date to go to have the battery fitted. I asked why the service manager hadn’t phoned me, to be told that they were very busy......
Sorry Mercedes, at present, I’m very disgruntled and disillusioned.....the last time this happened to me I changed brands ....."
2018-10-26,2,"19 Oct 2018 had a service, MOT and winter tyres replaced on my Mercedes C at Warrington Mercedes garage. The car was collected by staff from my home early in the morning and returned to me only very late afternoon (after 17.00) despite all job done by 13.00. Furthermore, the car was returned with dirty summer tyres stored inside the vehicle (back seats) not appropriately packed. Because of that one of my back seat was badly damaged by fresh grease. The grease fingerprints from dirty hands were also on driver's front door. It's fair to say that I have leather seats and all interior in cappuccino colour and not having children my car is kept in excellent condition like brand new. Having my car returned home too late, I only could take a photo of the damaged seat and door, and next morning I had to drive to the garage to have it fixed. The responsible service manager tried to fix it but not very successfully. There are still visible marks on the back seat and front door. I was told that the garage will book my vehicle for car valet but only in 3 weeks time as they are very busy. It was very disappointing experience. It's been one week now since this happened and I am still waiting for the call from Mercedes garage to book my car for valeting."
2018-10-26,5,"Fantastic service, will never visit a car supermarket again, faultless customer service, nothing is a problem"
2018-10-26,5,"Really easy, staff very polite and courteous.

2018-10-25,5,"Great friendly service from the Sales Team. Adam was helpful and listened to my requirements for a new Mini and came up with a car that ticked all the right boxes and at the right price.
The whole process was simple, efficient and straightforward."

2018-10-25,5,"We have just bought a 2nd hand Discovery Sport from Inchcape Norwich and really happy with the level of service we received.
From the moment we walked into the showroom to the final handover of the car, we were very well looked after by Keith who also managed to entertain our 5 year old at the same time."
2018-10-25,5,"Excellent treatment with full information, quick turnaround

2018-10-25,5,"Yesterday i had my Smart Forfour serviced at Nottingham
Claire looked after me and i was most impressed by her professional manor in answering all my questions with ease and honesty. Nothing was too much trouble and she always answered with a smile.
I was very impressed by the video showing my actual car during its service. and MOT.
I would highly recommend my friends and family to go to Mercedes Nottingham."
2018-10-25,5,Gary was great to deal with. We live quite a distance from the dealer so all set up over the phone and email. Gary kept me updated and always returned calls/emails. Car was well presented on pick up and easy handover with everything explained. Happy to recommend Coopers BMW for car purchase. Distance not an issue.
2018-10-25,5,excellent service
2018-10-25,4,Service booked online and accepted but date later changed by the garage. No problem this time. Service carried out ok and car cleaned afterwards although the cleaning of the wheels could have been better. The service provider was polite and courteous throughout and overall I was very satisfied with the whole process. Just one thing; the service was overly expensive and is offered at half the cost from a garage just a short distance away from Inchcape.
2018-10-25,5,Just purchased my nearly new used countryman from the Colchester garage - Salesman called Rhys. Great service - not pushy and very patient helping me look for something to suit my needs. Very happy with my new car. I will continue to use this garage for buying and service.
2018-10-25,5,"My first visit to Inchcape at Cheshire Oaks. An impressive facility and absolute first class service from Inchcape. A fair amount of warranty work on my car as it was due to run out, all done in a day with a courtesy car thrown in. Highly recommended."
2018-10-25,5,Smooth changeover of cars. All products were well explained. Very happy with my new car. Staff friendly and helpful. Would certainly use again.
2018-10-25,5,"Trade in Old car replaced with new . Whole process went very well and Maxine the sales mgr was very helpful. Called me and kept me informed during the whole process from placement of order to picking up the new car. Also followed up to see how I was getting on, answered questions and helped me set up the car and communications systems including BMW App on my phone and pairing my iPhone.

This is 3rd BMW car I have purchased from this dealership and it maintains its high standards of customer service."
2018-10-25,5,"Excellent service,will use again"
2018-10-25,5,Tom in service was great. Made everything easy and was really helpful and knowledgeable.
2018-10-25,1,"I booked my car for service on line and the cost was £246.96 .If you pay while booking on line you get £10 discount.
On the day of service (one hour service )I was asked if I wanted my car washed I said it should be part of service and the admin staff Sanjay said it was optional.After the service Sanjay came to me with a bill of £234.96 and said how I was going to settle the bill.I said I have already paid for on line
And I said to him how come it is still cheaper than on line.
He went back to his desk and amended the bill to £236.96. as principle I said I wanted to see the manager and he said we are all human being we do make mistake.
Since I order my car from Mercedes Benz Coventry I have problems They can never find file to see what extras I have paid and I have spent hours waiting in their show room(six plus hours.) I will never buy my next car from Mercedes-Benz Coventry."
2018-10-25,5,"great team, helpful at every level, exemplary customer care even for a humble used buyer. A pleasure to do business with them."
2018-10-25,5,Excellent service thank you
2018-10-25,5,Delighted with the service we received from Andrew with the purchase of our new Range Rover. The whole process from test driving to the exchange was handled efficiently and with great humour. It was pleasure.
2018-10-25,5,This was the first time buying a BMW so my expectations were quite high to start with. The staff at Cooper Chelmsford were very welcoming and friendly. I found the car I wanted on their website and booked an appointment to view and test drive which was very easy. The sales staff were very helpful and straightforward and I felt confident in buying the car. They gave a reasonable delivery date and had the car fully ready on the date given. I was completely happy with the entire proces. Will definitely recommend to my family and friends.
2018-10-24,4,"Delighted with service supplied when selecting my new car, Joe the salesman was helpful and worked to meet my requirements"
2018-10-24,5,"I bought an XF from Camryn at Jaguar Preston and could not be more pleased with the car of the service I received. The showroom is immaculate, the staff look after you and the sales process is as smooth as possible. Outstanding customer service."
2018-10-24,5,"Excellent service, easy to deal with from start to finish. Process was simple and effortless. Would definitely recommend."
2018-10-24,5,"I have nothing but praise to say about my experience with the Maidstone Audi garage.

I went to view cars ‘just to see if I liked Audi’s’ to be honest however I liked the cars so much that I decided to talk to the sales staff. The friendly, polite reception staff introduced me to Damon who I liked instantly. Damon was professional, down to earth and honest. Damon contacted me every time he said he would, by text, email and phone and kept me up to date with the sale progress.

Each time I visited the showroom all the staff members were friendly offering me refreshments and generally making sure I was ok and didn’t need anything. The showroom is spacious, clean with a nice atmosphere.

My new car is amazing and I love it. I would not hesitate to recommend this garage and in particular Damon should anyone reading this review be considering buying an Audi."
2018-10-24,5,"I have just bought my Mercedes B Class through Inchcape Oxford.

Marc Patterson and his line manager, Stuart, I can highly recommend.

Marc has only recently joined Mercedes but, he is clearly going to make a great sales person.

We are of the belief that you buy the car from the ‘person’ and whilst our car is at the lower end of the market, Marc and Stuart made no distinction whether we were spending £10,000 or £100,000.

The service we received was fabulous. Both were very attentive and everything went without a hitch.

Exactly the service you expect from MB.

Go and see Marc. No pressure. No long winded sales pitch, just a pleasant buying experience.

Lori and Miguel Sousa"
2018-10-24,5,Banstead Coopers did a great job and offered excellent customer service.
2018-10-24,5,"I've always received professional service from Colchester Inchcape and would recommend them to anyone. It was easy to book online and I was reminded about my service appointment via email. The staff are always friendly, polite and very helpful. I know my car will be looked at by trained mechanics who know what they're doing. The short video of the underneath of the car from the service pit is always helpful. The after-service explanation is always very detailed and helpful. In my case I needed further work done to the car but it could be done quickly."
2018-10-24,5,"Cooper BMW Norwich, great service did exactly as they promised. All those that I came into contact with new exactly what they were doing, familiar with the vehicle & all said with a smile!"

Love the car and I certainly wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to my friends and family."

2018-10-24,2,"8am appointment to leave my car for a service - I didn't leave the dealership until 8.40 - late for work - The staff were clearly there in their office however I was just left sitting in the waiting area - I questioned after 15 minutes if I would need to wait much longer and they said theyd be right out - another 15 minutes before they were.
I arrived back to collect my car at 5.30 as agreed and the same thing happened - it took all of 2 minutes to give me my keys back, yet I did not get out till gone 6pm.
I was not shown to my car, which had not been washed/hovered at all - I was told that it would be."

Also, thanks Alan for the supply of carrots for my horses that you promised us !
We will definately recommend this dealership to all our family and friends !"
2018-10-24,4,"Good experience, helpful receptionist and a comfortable waiting area."
2018-10-24,1,"A bunch of cowboys and a wasted day with Jaguar Norwich!
An appointment booked by Jaguar for an alarm fault. A one and half hour drive to Norwich today to be told on arrival the car needed to be left for two days. Total news to me as no one had informed me prior to this. Better still I am advised there is no courtesy car either. A fault on a year old F type and no means for a customer to return home! It was decided to try a repair today, inevitably on my return they informed it could not be done and I needed to come back again! However I was offered a free car valet inside and out, unbelievable. 😡
To state I am not happy is an understatement. Customer service is poor at best.
I will certainly never use this garage again, or recommend it to anyone!"
2018-10-23,5,Friendly and efficient service as always.
2018-10-23,5,Inchcape were great when my car failed it’s MOT. Andy the service manager couldn’t have been more helpful. My car also came back completely valeted.

2018-10-23,5,"Excellent Service From Cooper-BMW, Chelmsford.
All the BMW staff were polite, kind and really helpful. My car was collected from my home and taken to the main dealership for its first service. Due to a family emergency I needed the car back quickly so they prioritised it and got the car back to me later in the morning. They also sent me a video of the visual checks being made on the car. This was my first experience of a BMW service and I'm really impressed."
2018-10-23,5,Great service from start to finish
2018-10-23,1,Car was booked in and as a moibility car and curtesy car was supplied which was a big powerful car that was driven from the dealership and back to the dealership. It was on reserve fuel level so needed to be have fuel put in. They said they would ring when the car was ready but we started to be concerned when by 16.30pm we had not heard but had to leave a message which was not answered. When we arrived at the dealership about 17.30 the receptionist told us the car was ready so we sat in the waiting room for someone to say it was ready. Unfortunately I didn't have my mobile with me but when I returned home there were 2 messages sent at 18.15 telling me my car was ready while we were sat in the waiting room!!!!!!! This was totally wrong as they had my husband's number was left with them as I am unable to drive due to a hip operation. I would not recommend this dealership but unfortunately there are not many in our location
2018-10-23,5,Most approachable and sincere service I have ever received when buying a used car. Will recommend you guys to anyone I know. Thanks Jon Taylor
2018-10-23,5,"Excellent service from start to finish. I was kept well informed as to the progress of the works being carried out and costing.
Staff we’re courteous and helpful, extremely efficient.
They arranged a lift to my home and back to dealership.
All work completed as agreed.
Would have no hesitation in recommending Shrewsbury Inchcape VW dealership."
2018-10-23,5,"We are over the moon with Inchcape BMW Reading and especially salesman Matt. We traded in our old car and bought I truly excellent 440i GC M Sport. They fitted M performance body kit and M performance power and sound kit and has truly transformed the car. Highly recommended dealership, a very welcoming, relaxed and pleasurable experience."
2018-10-23,4,very good service
2018-10-23,5,"Having witnessed superb service from Cooper Norwich when my partner purchased a new car I had no hesitation in doing the same.
The whole experience was replicated for me and I have to say that James the salesman was knowledgeable, professional and exceptional throughout. From my first phone enquiry to delivery the attention to detail was spot on. When you’re committing a substantial amount of money you need confidence in the product and people; James and the rest of the staff who dealt with me made this ridiculously easy. A massive thank you to him and those others who made my experience so great. Well done."
2018-10-23,5,"Always excellent customer service at Inchcape, wouldn't go anywhere else."
2018-10-23,5,"Put my car in for a fault recently ....which in fact embarrassingly turned out to be a user error. The guys at the Inchape repair/service team were extremely helpful (particularly Laura) and the service excellent !

Thanks

Mike"
2018-10-23,3,"Very pleased with the young salesman. Very professional How ever. As a coustomer who funded the car to buy out right , I felt a bit of hostility because I didn’t take out there fiancé package,, it’s all about what they can offer if you do take it but you don’t get anything if you don’t!! ! And felt like I wasn’t as important , but like I said the sale guy was very good at his job and would recommend them to others but be wary if your funding from else were"
2018-10-23,1,"I was left waiting for some time after signing in and no one said sorry!!
I’ve asked for smart repair I don’t know how many times and I’ve either been let down or told they are to busy repairing your own used cars."
2018-10-23,5,"Excellent service from start to finish. Welcoming showroom with drinks available, lots of sales people around to help, but was not pestered when first started looking. Once we had questions we were shown to a seat and the salesman was happy to answer all our questions. Test drive was good and the decision to buy was made simple with all their knowledge and helpful advice. Paperwork didn't take too long and I was able to collect the car 6 days later. All in all a very swift and pleasant experience."
2018-10-23,4,This was the first time I had taken a car into Inchcape Land Rover Guildford for a service. The Service team were polite and professional and I was allocated one as a contact (Sacha) who kept me informed of progress and advised when the car was ready for collection. It was cleaned and ready as expected. I found the whole experience with Inchcape Land Rover exceptional 10/10 ✔️
2018-10-23,5,"Couldn't fault anything really. The service was good , very helpful and absolutely no hassle. I received a very generous part exchange allowance and the car I bought was immaculate and very well presented.

Highly recommended"
2018-10-23,5,"Excellent service from the team yesterday, warm reception, helpful staff, good communication, walked through service requirements in advance, offered me lift to nearby station. Received text to notify vehicle inspection video was ready and again when work was complete. Invoice all prepared for my arrival and greeted with helpful staff. Car was valeted very well and handed over by a member of the team. So overall a good team effort from the BWM Thames Ditton team. Thank you."

2018-10-23,1,"I have taken my C class for serivice for the last 8 years as it is the closest
Mercedes garage, on every occasion I have had to wait over an hour to

2018-10-23,4,"Very good service from all but especially Peter Smith who ended up getting me in an amazing 3 series , always had a speedy reply to all my emails and had follow up call to see how I was getting on with the car . Great service and would recommend ."

2018-10-22,1,Complete waste of my time
2018-10-22,5,We had good service and were dealt with efficiently and with politeness. Would have no difficulty in recommending to family and friends.
2018-10-22,2,"There was no real friction but a poor experience none the less.
My car received it’s required service with no problems.
However, I had also booked the car in for brake pads to be checked and if appropriate replaced. The booking was made 10 days before.
On the day, I was told they had no brake pads in stock and could therefore not be replaced that day. I was also advised that my car needed 4 new tyres. Again none were in stock.
The parts would take until the week after to arrive.
I was far from happy as I expected the dealership to have the pads available at the very least, as they had been aware they potentially needed changing.
The quote for brake pads and tyres was £2900.
I decided to take the car elsewhere for a second opinion and was advised that new tyres and pads were required but was quoted exactly half the price for the work to be completed.
I would advise anyone being quoted for work at this dealership to seek quotes elsewhere before agreeing to work being undertaken as the costings are extortionate."
2018-10-22,4,"Excellent service received.
Thoroughly professional service that started with Rob Bennett when he welcomed me in branch.
He explained all that would happen to my vehicle and his estimated times for completion were very accurate. He called during the day to update on progress and discuss some items discovered during the service.
The video clip received after the visit, demonstrated that the works had taken place."
2018-10-22,5,"Had a pleasent experience on the day, arrived on time and was met almost straight away by the service team (prior experience was a hole lot of waiting). Adrian who managed the day was excellent and when asked if I could get my car back earlier than the 16:00 drop and go time said he would see what he could do, and even text me to confirm his actions. All in all a good experience ( always a little heavy on the pocket as Mercedes certainly know how to charge)"
2018-10-22,5,Great service from Mini Malton.
2018-10-22,4,The staff at Durham are great. Unicycle website has a lot to be desired.
2018-10-22,5,Well organised and really polite staff. The whole process from booking the car in through to collecting it was made very simple. The car drives really well now. Overall really pleased and will be using this dealership again
2018-10-22,5,Excellent service from booking to return of car
2018-10-22,5,"My golf r was serviced with inchcape Oldham via the lease company.
Service was impeccable, from pick up through to drop off."
2018-10-22,2,"Unfortunately a fairly dissapointing exerience. I had called the week before to schedule in my service, the gentleman who answered explained that the service booking system was down, but would take my number and call me as soon as it was back on line....He never did. I called back the following week and scheduled in the service to my C63S. I has asked them to look at the windows which seemed to have a mind of their own in opening and closing, and on drop off i also explained there was a lot of creaking in the dash. on pick up they explained they didnt clean it because they were worried about the magno paint, even though they had cleaned it before, and they hadnt had time to look for the creaking noise. The magno paint story i assume was just a way to say they didnt have time, to be honest i would prefer the truth rather than be treated as if i am clueless. Apart from this staff are very nice"
2018-10-22,5,Excellent customer service
2018-10-22,5,"Great buying experience, not the usual game playing car salesmen.

An smooth transaction and collection process."
2018-10-22,5,"Good service
My car went in for recall, good service from Henry Tanor (technician) and Elliot Miller (Genius)"
2018-10-22,1,"Very bad service. 3h waiting became all day. I had to cancel a work meeting. Car (under warranty) came out damaged after the service, with a flat tyre! Upon collection no mention of the tyre. In fact they could not even find my car. I was left 30mins waiting, standing outside. When my car was eventually found, there was no mention of the flat tyre, although they clearly knew about it. Fortunately my car sensors are extremely sensitive so I was able to see the alarm light immediately and catch them before leaving the garage. The only thing I had asked them to look at, a slight noise when reversing, wasn’t fixed. And they charged me £135 over the phone for changing the brake fluid! In a car with only 18k and working perfectly? Absolutely unbelievable. I am still in a state of shock. Cheryl, the customer service representative, was very apologetic, polite and professional, she was sympathetic and tried her best to help. Despite the escalation to HQ, the branch head of business has been totally unresponsive. And I have just received an email asking for feedback? Here it is :D my name is still completely misspelled despite my correction. I want compensation for the major inconvenience caused to me and my family, for my missed work appointment and I want the money back for the brake fluid change. Nasty experience."
2018-10-22,4,Good hospitality. Nice deal
2018-10-22,5,"Amazing service Highly recommend
Took delivery of my 2013 JCW on Friday. Had everything done to it as requested, including prep, mot and de-stripe in a 2 day turn-around. Working in a dealer it is easy to spot a company not bothered and not on the ball. Had no issues at all and highly recommend."
2018-10-22,1,"Had Land Rover Evoque repaired at Guildford dealership primarily a fault with Land Rover for which I understood I'd be compensated. Service team promised a reply - 3 weeks later no response and Head of Business, David Boniface did not even do me the courtesy of acknowledging my complaint letter. ""Above and Beyond"" does not quite cut it!"
2018-10-22,5,"I purchased a used BMW from Coopers Ipswich (Megan Askew) and can’t fault any aspect, all very easy going and straightforward, not pushy on extra warranty options, etc, all in all a very good experience and I’m very happy with the car."
2018-10-22,5,"My ""experiences"" with Inchcape, are with LandRover at Norwich - I have dealt with the ""Parts Department"" for some time now - The ""Customer Service"" I have received has been ""Exemplary"" - On receipt of Item(s) dispatched to me, they have been well packaged to negate damage. A note of ""worthy recommendation"" is the assistance received when trying to locate the ""correct"" part(s) for various Land Rovers - Mr A. PERKINS has been extremely helpful when sourcing the component(s). His attention to detail has been most helpful - especially when there are so many part(s) to choose from, his ""investigative"" skills have have made my task(s) so much easier !! - I truly believe the Parts Department are the ""Buffer"" of this Dealership in working with the Sales/Service Personnel - I would also commend Mr M. DEARDS in the running of this department."
2018-10-21,1,"The dealership sent me a letter offering a complimentary end of warranty vehicle check. I booked my vehicle in 4 weeks in advance because I required a loan vehicle for some important appointments and I also took the day off work.

My service advisor called me at 8pm the night before the vehicle was due to go in to inform me that no loan vehicles had been returned and all he could offer me was a taxi back to my home address, therefore, giving me no time to rearrange my day or book a hire car.

On arrival at the dealership there was no apology for the inconvenience of not having the loan vehicle and to add further insult my service advisor who had called the night before did not have the decency to go through the work to be carried out on the vehicle. I was told I would get a phone call to inform me when the vehicle was ready for collection.

I took it upon myself to arrange for the dealership to send me a taxi early because I had no idea how long I would have to wait for the taxi to arrive when the vehicle was ready. On arrival at the dealership the work on my vehicle had been completed so I did not have long too wait.

My service advisor did not appear to be busy because he was sitting at his desk with no other customers and he was not on the phone. However, he asked a colleague to take payment for the work carried out, there was no explanation of the charges on the bill until I queried it and finally the payment was made standing up at another service advisors desk. This looked so unprofessional, unfortunately this is not the first time I have received poor service from this dealership so I will not be using them again."
2018-10-21,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my “BMW experience” at Coopers in York. From the initial phone enquiry to the handover I was made welcome and was met by Ian Farmery who was courteous and friendly, nothing was to much trouble and he took me through all the paperwork, explaining everything as he went, I then met Oliver who took me through the financial stages, again in a very polite and friendly manner. I was then introduced to the “BMW genius” Phil Morfitt, the man is a legend, he showed me around the car and explained everything I needed to know, he then set up everything for me which would of taken me days if not weeks without his help. If I decide on another BMW in the future I would have no hesitation in returning to Coopers and hopefully dealing with these same guys again."
2018-10-21,5,"Very happy with the service I received

Comfortable lounge to wait in with complimentary hot and cold drinks, tv and free wifi. Work done within the estimated time and car had been valeted. Very impressed as our car is not new and wasn't purchased from this dealership, but this made no difference to the excellent service given."
2018-10-20,5,Very good service all round
2018-10-20,5,"The service I recieved at BMW Teesside was fantastic. Both Matthew and Shaun listened to what I wanted and ensured that they found car to match my needs. I love the car I purchased and would certainly return in the future.
I would recommend the branch to anyone."
2018-10-20,5,"Enjoyable experience our salesman Haj a charming young man helpful , keen to assist in pleasant surroundings & of course ultimately I’ve acquired a beautiful vehicle for myself ."
2018-10-19,5,Very good service
2018-10-19,4,"Good service, poor response to a follow up request ... still not responded to me"
2018-10-19,4,Very professional and courteous. Great showroom experience. Made to feel valued in the friendliest way. However the mileage on my car when I took it to the garage was around 30560 miles - a very similar reading was shown when the key was read. When my car was serviced the reading was 30606 miles. What caused the roughly 40 miles difference?
2018-10-19,5,"Stephanie at the service desk went out of her way to be helpful. I had made a mistake and she managed to sort it out for me and was very kind. Victor was also really helpful and nothing seemed to be any trouble.

Many Thanks
Sam"
2018-10-19,5,"I must amit the first time we brought a car from bmw Croydon the experience was not good, that was back in 2015. This time however our sales person Kevin was amazing at every step of the way. He restored my faith in BMW. I would highly recommend that if your changing your car you ask for Kevin. I absolutely love my new car, and would not hesitate to go back, but I would only ask for Kevin. Very professional and friendly. Thank you Kevin."
2018-10-19,5,"Tom at Mercedes Chester was excellent. From my call to collecting vehicle. Every detail explained and nothing too much. Tom is a credit to the company.
My son was happy with the car report and detailed explanation.
10/10."
2018-10-19,5,Great service from Aadam at Cooper Thames Ditton. Really looked after us through the whole sales process
2018-10-19,4,"Very thorough review of the service and MOT.
Seen quickly on arrival and on collection.
Only down side is lack of communication re progress or when car is likely to be ready."
2018-10-19,3,"Greeting desk staff are always excellent helpful and cheery.
Service staff polite but every visit I end up waiting an unacceptable length of time to be seen and then collect my car.
Service costs are well above normal costs downside of buying MB.
Always something extra on the bill this time Adblue nor did they ask me for my permission
Service A is very basic yet costs £334?"
2018-10-19,5,"My experience with Mercedes Benz Cheshire Oaks was excellent , the car was in for Recall modification.
Anthony Lannigan took care of the process from start to finish .
The Video of the Mercedes Technician completing the health check was Excellent too.
And the vehicle was washed and polished like new, like I have experienced for 25 years..
I have been taking Mercedes Benz cars to Mann Island Liverpool and Newgate Mercedes of Chester for twenty five years.
Its a same I took my Loma Forged German SL Steam 20 inch 3 piece wheels in Piano matt/gloss black of the AMG with them being the only set in the UK for a 6.3 AMG they are stunning and make the car stand out more than it already does..
Thank you."
2018-10-19,5,"I am new to Mercedes-benz, but I’ve driven for 33 years. I’ve never had the superb experience I had with Mercedes Warrington. It’s the little touches that make the difference. I chose to wait on site although you can have a courtesy car to go about your day. I was kept informed throughout, with face to face contact and texts. When work was complete they brought my car to the front of the show room, valeted and like new and I was sent a link to watch the whole service. Mercedes are very customer focused and have a decent coffee machine and stock my favourite biscuits so I really didn’t mind waiting an hour for my car to be ready, especially in their comfy chairs. Can’t fault them and all the staff are so friendly and helpful"
2018-10-19,4,"Very polite and attentive staff, car cleaned thoroughly prior to hand-back, paperwork complete and accurate."
2018-10-19,5,From initial enquires to my completion of the purchase I received excellent service from the customer sales advisor.
2018-10-19,5,"Fantastic staff, so friendly and helpful given that my situation wasn't the easiest!! I will be going back to them when the time is right to get my new car."
2018-10-19,5,Excellent friendly service.
2018-10-19,5,Very transparent and easy to deal with
2018-10-19,3,"The actual servicing of the car and the attitude of the people on site were great, but I was told the service would take 90 minutes when booking and on arrival, therefore a little too short for me to go home and back. In the end I waited almost 4 hours (there was nothing wrong with the car). I would have appreciated being given a realistic expectation of the time frame."
2018-10-19,5,Good experience bought a used bmw from them without seeing it because I live 290 miles away car was delivered on time and was as expected
2018-10-19,1,"I am totally dissatisfied with the service from your garage. My car was collected on Thursday am, and as I had not heard from anyone at 5.45 made several calls to see if my car was in transit, no one from your garage contacted me therefore I had no choice but to get a taxi at 7pm. With no car today I had to get a taxi to work. One of your team called me at 11.30 today (Thursday) to arrange my car to be dropped off, as I am at an off site meeting I arranged for my car to be dropped off on Friday. I have followed up with customer services today at Zenith and explained what happened, how disappointed I am with the lack of communication, poor customer service and the inconvenience this has given me over the past few days"
2018-10-19,4,"Professional, friendly and efficient."
2018-10-18,4,Great help and experience from start to finish. This is my second car from here would come here again
2018-10-18,4,Good Customer care
2018-10-18,5,"I had the pleasure of dealing with Maxine at BMW. I enjoyed the whole process and was made to feel very welcome throughout. Everything was done very quickly and I thoroughly enjoyed being able to build and design everything to how I wanted. If you’re reading this, a huge thank you again for all of your help and to everyone else at BMW that helped me along the way!"
2018-10-18,5,"I presented a challenge to the team at Inchcape Stratford-upon-Avon on my return to the UK from 12 years living & working in New Zealand, to help present with the vehicle I was after and to assist me to secure the financing I required (not an easy task after 12 years out of the country!)

Both Aaron (Sales) and Mark (Business Manager) went out of their way to meet my needs and work around the issues of financing with someone whose credit file has lapsed after being overseas over a decade.

I am delighted with the Mercedes E Class I have secured and greatly appreciate the patience, courtesy and proactiveness extended by the team at Inchcape SOA. I would highly recommend them, to meet your needs."
2018-10-18,5,"Deal with Andrew who was brilliant.
Showed and went through all the controls and settings.
Plenty of tea and coffee on offer as you buy.
Looking forward to aftersales to see if they keep up the good service."
2018-10-18,5,"Very good service, from start to finish, kept me informed about everything, very nice waiting room, with tea and coffee, excellent service from all, without any hassle."
2018-10-18,5,"They gave me a early start, got there Parts was not open but they opened for me to get my car key, then round to Service to get it programmed into my car, and because I had an early Hospital appointment they rushed it through for me, but also did a vehicle inspection which said I needed new wiper blades, and also one tyre was getting near legal limit, so all in all very pleased with the way they handle my car and us, well worth the trip.
cheers alex pownall"
2018-10-18,5,"Tim Charlesworth was amazing. I am really happy with the service I received from him. He made the experience of buying a brand new car a positive and rewarding one.
People that go above and beyond are worth investing time and money in. Mini would be very foolish if they didn’t work hard to keep Tim."
2018-10-18,5,I will strongly recommend inchcape mini durham i was well look after by ellie ..thanks so much.
2018-10-18,5,"purchased 4 clips, price was good, staff very friendly. Everything about the place and the staff excellent. 10 out of 10."
2018-10-18,5,"Really impressed. Received a recall on my car. They checked I was still coming prior to the appointment, they did a free observation test and a free car wash - who wouldn't say yes to that?! They also hoovered the inside.
Staff friendly and assertive. Felt very confident with what I was being told. Very little waiting. Definitely pleased I bought a Toyota :)"
2018-10-18,5,great service
2018-10-18,5,"Car Service - 10,000 miles - Excellent efficient prompt service - quicker than expectation and they washed and cleaned my car - unexpected!!!"
2018-10-18,3,"Despite having a timed appointment to drop the car off, the member of staff was not available (as is usual), and after waiting around for a while, I ended up doing a ""key drop""."
2018-10-17,5,"Good experience, answered all my questions with honesty, good people to deal with. Mine was s very good experience. Highly recommended."
2018-10-17,5,Very friendly! Brad was a great help. Love my car.
2018-10-17,5,I live in derby so first visited inchcape derby... what an awful experience... I was left wandering around the showroom on a Sunday (busiest day of week?). So travelled to Nottingham and the experience was SO different. Greated by Dave he showed me round the car I was interested in. Friendly and knowledgable he really wanted help. I bought the car !
2018-10-17,5,Excellent service. Friendly staff. Work done to a very high standard. Can’t fault anything. Would definitely recommend.
2018-10-17,2,"Called at BMW York on 4 previous occasions and despite me spending plenty of time wandering around the showroom and forecourt never once was i approached and offered any help or questioned if i was looking for anything in particular. so when i spotted a car on auto-trader at the same dealership i was reluctant to travel back to view the advertised car. On my 5th visit again i was never approached or offered any assistance in anyway.
I couldn't see the vehicle i had come to see on the forecourt so i eventually went to reception to ask for assistance, i was told somebody from used sales would be with me in a couple of minutes, 20 minutes later still no sales person, i was later approached and told i would get some help in a couple of minutes, another 20 minutes later i started to leave when a young man came running up behind me offering to help. the young man was not a sales person but the finance manager and he offered to help find the car i had gone to view. He kept apologising for the lack of help from his so called sales colleagues and he did everything he could to help in their absence, including taking me on a test drive which i had to show the young man a route as he didn't do sales or test drives. i did buy the car but no thanks to any of the sales staff at bmw York other than a very helpful finance manager who was still juggling his finance role whilst trying to help me.
Not impressed with inchcape."
2018-10-17,5,"Excellent service and very helpful, polite and friendly staff"
2018-10-17,5,Superb professional handover of my new F Pace with Martyn Harvey. A pleasure to do business with.
2018-10-17,5,"I did go to the Warrington Mercedes dealer with a small automatic in mind. Then I saw the SLC 180 manual and thought yes that’s what I want.
Ash Alli came to see me and we discussed trade in value for my previous car etc. Ash was very helpful 10 out 10 and the new car was mine to pick up 4 days later, an excellent result.
When I picked up the car all the transfer of my trade in went like clockwork, and signing the paperwork for my new car was straightforward. The big reveal was an excellent way to set off on my new adventure. Thanks Ali"
2018-10-17,5,"From entering the showroom & Adam introducing himself, we experienced first class service (with a smile). Adam was friendly & knowledgeable, he listened to what we were looking for, did not rush us, gave us lots of options, we received exactly what we were promised & he kept us informed at all times, the icing on the cake was a short video thanking us for our custom & a courtesy call this afternoon to ask how our first 24 hours of owning/driving the car was. We cannot recommend him enough, certainly the most enjoyable experience of purchasing a car we have had to date. We will be strongly recommending your company & Adam to our friends, family & work collegues, well done to you. Stuart & Janet Peacock"
2018-10-17,5,Great service especially a thank you to “Laura” in your service department for her assistance.
2018-10-17,5,"as usual , excellent service and aftercare plus lovely coffee and biscuits !!. Thanks again."
2018-10-17,5,Excellent job
2018-10-17,5,"All work booked was done promptly, and my car was returned clean. A part that needed replacing was ordered, and when received, fitted while I waited. Staff are helpful and friendly."
2018-10-17,5,Just bought a used Jaguar XF from Inchcape Norwich. I received excellent professional service from Blake Jarvis. Can thoroughly recommend this company and Their representative.
2018-10-17,5,Excellent service . Reassuring and thorough .
2018-10-17,2,"Booked car in for 8am - got there at 7.50am - no one in the place, at 8.05 I was still waiting with 8 other customers, when a guy breezed in, wearing his coat and a Subway coffee in his hand and took or names, and asked us to sit and wait 8.15, finally gave they keys over. surely if you take bookings for 8am - you have staff in maybe at 7.45???

Went to collect cat at 5.10, waited till 5.35 to get my invoice (for over £900!) I was asked if I had seen where my car was on the way in, I said yes, but it was blocked in, was told he would get someone to move it, sat and waited until 5.50pm for the car to be moved."
2018-10-17,4,"Friendly & efficient service. The car was ready promptly and I was notified both by telephone and by e-mail, with a video showing tyre wear that required attention.
The only issue, and one common in my experience with most main dealers - drop off and collection always seems to take longer than expected. Even so, fifteen minutes each end was considerably better than I've been used to."
2018-10-17,1,"Car went in for MOT at Warrington, said it would take about an hour including washing and hovering, took nearly two hours and no valet on my car whatsoever never even touched it, this was always done by a Mercedes Garage to my knowledge before, sort it Mercedes @Warrington."
2018-10-17,5,"I very recently purchased a Range Rover Evoque from Inchcape Jaguar Land Rover Preston. This dealership is over 200 miles away from where I live and I would ABSOLUTELY travel all that way to purchase another vehicle again. The reason being, Alan Wood. I had very specific requirements for the car I wanted to buy and hence did a nationwide search of vehicles. The vehicle I fell in love with happened to be in Preston but I knew that the distance would be worth it. I made a telephone enquiry and was passed to Alan Wood who deals with Used Approved Vehicles. From the moment he picked up my call he was informative, courteous, highly professional and so very helpful. He provided all the information I asked for, even went out of his way to take notes and call me back when he didn't know the answers there and then. Being such a distance from the dealership everything until handover was dealt with by phone and email but Alan's approach was just as personal as I assume it would have been had I been a customer in branch. Swift responses and detailed emails made my experience all the more pleasant. Alan sent me a video of the car taking me through a detailed tour of the vehicle even pointing out the 'not-so-perfect' aspects that you can sometimes overlook on a Used Approved Vehicle. Once I had made my decision to go ahead with the purchase, Alan sent me all the documentation required for signing and took a deposit to secure the car. We arranged and collection date and I took a 3 hour train to Preston. Alan was waiting to collect me from the Station when I arrived and took me to branch. He ensured I had something to drink having travelled so far and then proceeded to show me the vehicle which had been prepared with a red silk sheet and red bow covering it. Alan took me through a thorough briefing of how the car worked, set up my Bluetooth and InControl app and even let me charge my phone as I was running low! Down south, you only get this sort of treatment when you buy a NEW car, and that's if you're lucky. (I know people who have bought cars in excess of £50k new and just been given the keys and waved off the forecourt!!). All in all I have to say that this was the best, most professional, most personal car buying experience I have had (and I've bought 5 cars in the last 8 years!!). I have already recommended Alan Wood and Inchcape Land Rover Preston to a colleague and will continue to recommend to other acquaintances of mine in the future. Thank you Alan and Inchcape Preston for your professionalism and personal approach. I'll definitely be returning in future."
2018-10-17,5,"I am part of the mobility scheme and sometimes health isn't so good - the service and help I received from this garage was excellent and gave me one less worry.

Thanks all"
2018-10-17,4,"The whole experience was somewhat spoiled be the handover. We went in to pick a car up at 9:30, and we finally left at 12:00. Nothing seemed to be ready, they had to re-do all the finance paperwork, the car wasn't quite ready, even though they extended the handover by 3 working days."
2018-10-17,5,"It was a pleasure buying our car, the team at Cooper Cobham are really friendly and make buying a new car hassle free.
Will definitely return when we want to buy the next mini."
2018-10-16,5,"Negotiation for a used vehicle, combined with part exchange, dealt with professionally and exclusively by telephone contact, myself having never physically viewed the vehicle in which I had expressed an interest beforehand. A wholly seamless exercise with no time wasting from either party and leading to a mutually satisfactory result. Exactly as I have come to expect from BMW main dealerships in recent years. On the agreed date for handover, I was welcomed by friendly staff, the vehicle had been prepared in readiness, and all related paperwork was to hand, straightforward and handled efficiently."
2018-10-16,5,"The whole experiance was really good, the receptionist, Leanne Balls looked after things, booking in and bringing my car after service. My cars birthday was this week and no cake, doesn’t mater I went to Tescos"
2018-10-16,5,"I sold my Discovery to Norwich Inchcape and bought a nearly new Evoque from them. The whole process, with Sam, was very thoughtfully and patiently handled, apart from the cost which cannot be avoided (!) a completely painless and indeed enjoyable experience"
2018-10-16,4,Whereas I am happy with the Ac5ual service on the car I am very frustratedly by the hopeless switchboard service of this dealership . There are 2 numbers advertised. On 01515157128 no one has ever answered only a recording to leave my message . I have used this number about 6 times in the past an no one ever has called me back. The other number is usually answered but the re#ponse 5ime is very poor .
2018-10-16,5,"Great customer service. Reasonable price. Went the extra mile when I had a question after I had picked my car up... wanted to know what car freshener they used as it smelt great..
Abigail followed up my inquiry with all the information I needed.
Recommend to others"
2018-10-16,5,"Great customer service experience, made to feel like a value customer. Great staff ( Mini) who were welcoming and well presented."
2018-10-16,5,Really helpful the lady on reception remembered me the second time I went in. Was offered tea while waiting. Jodie was really good and explained everything we needed to know.
2018-10-16,5,"Excellent service, It was my first time I used Cooper BMW servicing in Reading and I must say it was one of the best car serving experience so far. Mark, the customer serving manager was friendly and kept me up to date with the work that was being done with my car, provided car lift to get home even though there wasn’t any car scheduled. I would use them again and would recommend anyone with BMW to use them without any worries!"
2018-10-16,1,"Being a Mercedes customer for almost twenty years I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of customer care shown by the staff at Inchcape at St Georges.
I have just had my vehicle serviced at the Leicester dealership and am left questioning whether I am regarded as a loyal customer or just a someone who is impinging on the reception staff's ""leisure"" time whilst at work!!
The reception staff were more interested in testing out the electric recline of large vehicle in reception rather than deal with the customers waiting at the desk.
I now realise why it takes so long for a phone call to be answered.
Are the management oblivious to this???
The service technician, on collection, just seemed to want to get rid of me as quick as possible, leaving me wondering whether his tea was getting cold!!"
2018-10-16,5,This company could not have been more helpful. They made purchasing a new car a pleasant and exciting experience-this was the least stressful car purchase I have ever had . They guided us through the process with care and empathy-explained everything and answered any of our questions thoroughly .Andrew was great -I can recommend him /them without reservation. Thank you Chester Inscape!
2018-10-16,5,"good experience buying a car, straight-forward and easy. Ollie was most helpful"
2018-10-16,5,"I was thinking of changing my car so of I went to mercedes Llandudno junction, was looking around all the used cars as I didn't really no what I wanted, I was then approached by Mark who had seen me looking at this lovely 66 plate CLA 220d. Within 30 minutes later I was driving out the gate with my new car white with 9 thousand miles and what a price he gave me out my old car. Could not have got that anywhere. Top man is our Mark."
2018-10-16,5,"Only went in for a prebooked MOT but made to feel extremely welcome.
Offered coffee and chat with advisor, Had an envious look around the showroom. Sat in the customer lounge and was impressed by the friendliness of all the staff passing by.
Car passed the MOT and was washed.
Compared to previous main dealer experiences albeit a few years ago my experience was that Mercedes Coventry reflect their image.
Cannot recommend highly enough.

2018-10-16,5,"Efficient & courteous service
Work carried out to complete satisfaction within agreed timescales
No complaints whatsoever"
2018-10-16,5,"Having bought cars at frequent intervals during my life I know how poor the customer service can generally be and I dread going into most car showrooms. Jaguar Inchcape in Southampton proved to be the exception to the rule. The team of Nathan, Howard and Mark were exceptional. Their knowledge, honesty, and personality made the buying of my F Type an enjoyable and entertaining experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this company to my business colleagues and friends.
Gentlemen keep up the good work.

2018-10-15,5,"Buying a car is never easy with the amount of varying extras & mounting costs ... where do you start & end?! it’s not easy .... however James made to easy & fun (yes this is meant to be a joyous experience believe it or not!) ... I went through everything ... 15 plus times & never got a negative attitude (even when leaving my 3 year old in the cabin to see if he could break anything (which would have been a deal breaker! Lol!! He can usually break anything in 15 seconds flat!), communication was fabulous & I can honestly say James went above & beyond for me & my Smartie (Smart ForFour aka Vinnie) from start to finish ... I couldn’t even drive out the show room as there was the tiniest smear on the windscreen ... (tiny!!) until it was clear & perfect ... ! In a vast shrinking world of good customer service & everything being available online (which all my docs were & are ... big thumbs up ... ) face to face wins for me every time! Cheers Notts James has served you well, he is a credit to your team & the Mercedes name ... until next time! No pressure!!"
2018-10-15,5,"Best price and great service!

I bought an almost new BMW 420i Gran Coupe M Sport. Having done a lot of research the price Cooper Reading offered was the most competitive. Had to drive 30 miles but it was worth it. The car I wanted was reserved for 2 hours. Dan was great, he was very friendly and answered all questions we had. He offered the same level of service till we drove off in our new car.

There was no pressure to make a sale. They have a wide range of cars. You get to have a look at as many cars as you want at your leisure and most of them are not locked.Which means you get to see and feel how the car is, features, options etc and the new make a confident choice of what you want. The cars are mainly indoors which means you could go and view them leisurely irrespective of the weather.

Would thoroughly recommend them to anyone."
2018-10-15,4,"The service was carried out as discussed with the service reception, with no problems. However when I arrived to pick up the vehicle, I was hanging around for some time before I could pick my vehicle up. There was nobody on the service desk and I had to ask three times to get somebody to attend to me. This is not up to expected Mini standards."
2018-10-15,2,when i went in to look a my car i was made to wait 1 hour before anyone came to see me and i had to chase then up for my finance and when i went to pick up my car i was made to wait 30 minutes before anyone came to see me i was made to fill that they don't want my custom
2018-10-15,2,"Dreadful customer service at Mini Cooper Thames Ditton Service. Impossible to contact them unless via central system. Get cut off after 2 minutes. Central system operators not able to contact either. This happens every time I call for an update. Promised service completion times not kept at great inconvenience to me. Frustrated to be asked for feedback via email whilst the issue has not been resolved, hence the 2 star."
2018-10-15,5,My 1st experience of Audi garage/service and can say I was very happy. Professional staff throughout from booking reminders and then up-to-date information during the MOT. Thank you.
2018-10-15,5,"I have bought cars from main dealers since I have been driving and purchasing from kings lynn inchcape landrover has by far been the best experience so far. Every single member of staff is so polite and friendly, they constantly check you are happy and ok for drinks, just makes you feel so comfortable and welcome. Sebastian sold us our vehicle and it’s safe to say we will return to Sebastian time and time again we are so greatful for all of his time and effort in getting us into the right vehicle for us. He pays excellent attention to the customers wants and needs. Sebastian if you read this thank you, you are so good at your job and we can’t wait to return to you next time around."
2018-10-15,1,"First visit to this showroom Mercedes Benz of Leicester"" for my car servicing.
Booked online with reached there before time though chose the time 1015 am but literally no parking space. Some how manage to park.
Went to reception waiting to be called though standing in front but two of the ladies busy chatting and completely ignoring the customer. Have to say good morning to draw their attention.
Asked rudely to sit and wait for someone to come. Waited 1036am gentleman came from service department. Took the keys and said my car will be ready by 1200 pm.
Waiting in the lounge 1245 none update and no courtsey to inform why there is a delay. Went to reception againg and manage to draw the attention again of the chatting busy receptionist. reluctantly called the service department and say "" oh you are early your car is due at 1300 pm"" I said is was due at 1200 pm she called again to service department and then told me it will be ready in 20 mins has gone for washing. waited till 1400 pm nothing happen at 1410 service department guy came and rudely asking me your car is serviced but not washed you want your car washed then your have to wait for 20 mins or take your car and rebook for wash for some other day ""NO APOLOGY"". I said cant come again he said ok wait then. 1445pm came back and said car ready...............What a customer care though having Mercedes for last 10 years and always been to Mercedes Benz showroom but never had this type of experience. Hope to see improvement after this comment."
2018-10-15,5,Dealt with Dan and he was very helpful from start to finish.
2018-10-15,5,Excellent friendly service. Allan Jones has the patience of a saint as I had never driven an automatic car before !!
2018-10-15,2,"Didn't resolve a reported issue on first visit.
Didn't charge my e-vehicle as didn't have enough charge points!
Basic stuff that seemed to be too difficult."
2018-10-15,5,"Booked my car in for a service.
Inchcape kept me informed via email and text of the booking.
On the day of the service it was taken at the time they said and was ready ahead of schedule.
Car was also washed and cleaned which was a nice touch."
2018-10-15,4,"I have just collected my Land Rover Discovery Sport Landmark. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I did not have much to do with the sales team, as I dealt personally with Stephen Shortland the Business Manager. Stephen made the whole process seem easy. I was treated with respect and kindness. I was given the opportunity to test drive a vehicle for a prolonged period and Stephen answered all my questions. He is highly professional, knowledgeable and took his time building up my business relationship. Thank you Stephen!"
2018-10-15,4,"Car collected 10mins prior to start if agreed timeslot & returned (after being telephoned to inform that all was complete) an hour before the start of the agreed timeslot!
Telephone conversation confirmed all service items and was asked if there was an issue with the final invoice being less than the quote!
Great service & will use again."
2018-10-15,5,"Attentive staff,
Nice variety in showroom
my partner particularly liked the biscuits :)"
2018-10-15,4,Booked online for service and all went smoothly. Pleased I could get a loan car as well to avoid having to wait 3 hours! My only criticism is the cost - basically an oil and micro filter change shouldn’t be £370. Once out of warranty I will definitely be using independent garages!
2018-10-15,4,I brought a used BMW 3 Series from Cooper Cobham. There was a problem but the salesperson Kevin Van Hinsbergh resolved the issue quickly and delivered my car a few days later. Leaving me a very happy customer. I would have no hesitation in using BMW Cooper Cobham again or recommending them to a friend.
2018-10-14,5,"From inquiring to buying I was dealt with professionally and courteously, Alan wood is a straight talking honest gentleman. A pleasure to deal with."
2018-10-13,5,Well done Inchcape
2018-10-13,1,"Had my car for one week now. The car we bought is good, it is the Mercedes Benz quality car.

But the service we received from the sale lady DO NOT MATCH with Mercedes-Benz quality: obvious pushy, just want your money from pocket in minimum time, didn’t explain about things much. Happy with the car but not the service."
2018-10-13,1,"I have owned 3 BMWs over the last 10 years and each one has been great. The biggest problem with them is the quality of the servicing and repair aftercare from the dealerships. Its gotten so bad that I'm now in a place where I'm due to renew my car and the latest episode with Cooper Thames Ditton has persuaded me away from BMW. Just shows that you can have a great product but its not effective if you don't match it with decent service.
I left my car with Cooper Thames Ditton at 9am on a Friday morning. Didn't get any update so I rang them at 5.50pm and was assured the service manager would ring me back before close of business. Nothing
Rang them on Saturday morning and once again assured someone would get back to me. Nothing.
When I eventually spoke to someone it became clear that they hadn't even looked at it and had no intention of doing so for another few days...
They simply don't care - no interest whatsoever in communicating honestly with a customer and doing what they say they're going to do. That dealership must have some fundamental problem because it can't just be limited to the front line staff"
2018-10-13,4,"Thought service adviser approach was very accepatable ,,,my previous visit to the sales side was very poor and help received back from them was very poor"
2018-10-13,1,"They made a mistake with my vehicle details, and put the wrong reg number on all the paperwork and now refuse to get back to me to sort it out. I have tried to call the service man who dealt with my vehicle many times, I have left messages, and emailed him to call me, but I have heard nothing from him. I received a telephone call from Lexus asking me about my experience and I explained the problem. The person apologised and said she would contact them and get them to call me and sort it out. I am not surprised that I have still heard nothing from them. This was the first time I dealt with Lexus Battersea since buying my new car, I will be looking elsewhere to get my vehicle serviced in the future, even though this will be inconvenient as they are my nearest service dealer."
2018-10-13,5,Excellent service All round - professional yet welcoming - special mention and thanks to Alicia Patmore for her assistance dealing with a third party warranty provider and for arranging repairs to my car whilst I’m on holiday - another big yes for me was the transport to and from the train station - very nice gentleman whose name I don’t recall - thank you all
2018-10-13,5,"Ben, Ashur, Tom and the rest of the team are really nice people to do business with. They don't hurry you and are helpful throughout."
2018-10-13,2,"I purchased a car here. The salesman was friendly, you get lots of coffee, but everything is very slow. Sat waiting each visit while the admin departmy were meant to be doing paperwork.
It gave me time to talk to other customers who were equally fed up waiting to pick up spares etc.
On collection day my pic up was postponed ‘ because the central IT was down’ . When I arrived at the later time it took 2.5 hours to actually get the keys and go. Lots of apologies but honestly they really need to get this place running efficiently."
2018-10-13,5,"Hi thanks to the team and support for their great healp, i got all i needed thanks"
2018-10-12,5,"Owen the technician was absolutely brilliant. He done the work on the car,and had it finished at the time he told me. Fantastic if you use Cooper Cobham get him to do it!"
2018-10-12,2,"Used Fast Lane - was told it would be 90 minutes, took over 3 hours for an oil change and microfilter. Not happy."
2018-10-12,5,Fantastic service from JT. No pressure to purchase. Made the whole process easy. Very supportive down to accommodating kids in the show room
2018-10-12,1,"If there was a minus option I’d go for that. Want to buy a car - they’re on it, want to take one back under warranty because it doesn’t work properly - just not interested. Absolutely appalled by their after service."
2018-10-12,5,great customer service and very professional
2018-10-12,5,"Very good service and staff was very helpful.

Thanks"
2018-10-12,5,Always very friendly staff and a great service.
2018-10-12,5,"I took my car in for a parts recall with Inchcape, Chelmsford and they were very good. Helpful and knowledgeable staff, comfortable customer waiting area, with tea and coffee etc. while you wait. Definitely recommend and would use them again."
2018-10-12,1,"I took a policy out with Coopers BMW Teeside after purchasing a car from them last year. The salesman was keen to inform me - "" just call them up and they will sort it all out for you in the event of any scratches on your car. Your covered"" That simply was not the case. Email after email, phone call after phone call, still no service.

The most recent email i did get from them informed that Dent Wizard would be in touch in two days. (I do hope those jokers aren't repairing my car. Please read on line just how bad they are. Its shocking... ) That was not the case. That was the last email I got from Inchcape and since then every time I email them, its an auto response email and no one gets back in touch"
2018-10-12,3,The sales manager was very helpful but the sales representative did not always listen to our requirements. Additionally we were requested to complete the purchase paperwork without actually seeing the car. Furthermore upon collection of the car the boot liner had been removed as we were told we had not purchased it.
2018-10-12,5,"I can honestly say that the service was excellent!! Every person I dealt with were friendly, helpful and very professional."
2018-10-12,5,"Very professional from the booking in of the car over the phone, to the appointment reminders, to the young lady who welcomed me at the reception, to the video assessment of my cars needs, emailed to me (clever transparency) and everyone ont the staff in between. Impressed. Very slick and professional. If you want an ego boost, you could do worse than book the can in for a service and wait."
2018-10-12,5,"The service that I received from Preston Park was excellent.
I would like to say a big thank you to Debbie & Brad for their excellent customer service.
They were a pleasure to deal with.
Thank you again."
2018-10-12,5,"Excellent service from start to finish when buying our new BMW.
Many thanks to Peter for his patience."
2018-10-12,5,Friendly helpful Service Desk. Work on vehicle carried out to high standard with attention to detail. Car returned cleaned and in the time given to complete requested work. While you wait cofffee shop comfortable with good coffee and magazines.
2018-10-12,5,"Great service from picking the car up and bringing it back washed nice and clean. And also the video of underside of the car, brilliant"
2018-10-12,5,Very good technical & courteous service 😀
2018-10-12,5,Great Service delivered bang on time!
2018-10-12,5,Good efficient service with excellent feedback.
2018-10-12,5,looked after well by entire team
2018-10-12,5,"This is my first experience of owning a Toyota vehicle and therefore the crucial aftercare.

I contacted the Guildford dealership to book my car in for a safety recall. They could not have been more helpful and more courteous. I got an appointment for the next day and was asked if I had any other issues I wanted them to look at. They called me back later that day to confirm my appointment, and again were very helpful. I arrived the next day a very nice lady looked after me, gave me a coffee until the service team were available which was not long. The very nice lady from the service department advised me what was going to happen and said they would call me when the car was ready. I got a text from the dealership with a video of my car and the technician looking after it giving the seal of approval. I was called by a helpful guy called Jordan to confirm my car was ready and everything was ok. I collected the car and again the team there were so helpful. I would so recommend this dealership."
2018-10-12,1,Exceedingly poor service. I booked my car for service online and was phoned to confirm and then few days later they told not to bring the car in.
2018-10-12,5,"From the outset I was treated with politeness and courtesy, have no complaints at all, was excellent throughout."
2018-10-12,5,"Excellent customer service, staff very polite."
2018-10-12,1,"Had a engine management warning light following toyota check they recommended cat change at great expense which didn't clean the warning light.
13 Oct cleaned the lambda sensor this morning which fixed the error message so a new cat bought for no reason due to poor trouble shooting by toyota. This also mean a serviceable cat scrape for no reason. I comfirmed it was the sensor once I bought myself a DTC box and just check the error with and without the sensor attached. This would have been easy for Toyota to do thereby saving me over £200 in replacement cat cost."
2018-10-11,4,Everything was fine with the process. The car collection could have been better. We were told via a phone call the collection was to be between 10 and 11am. In fact he called at 9.15 and was a little impatient when we took a while to get to the door. Otherwise all fine
2018-10-11,5,"Easy to book, efficient and well informed.
video helpful."
2018-10-11,4,"Saw vehicle on line made a call went to see, service was very good, liked car brought it and the process was very easy and smooth. Mercedes were very professional. Jason the guy who looked after me was very helpful and called me a few days after I had brought the car to check all was ok. I could not have asked for any more. Very happy."
2018-10-11,4,Great service but pricing at the high end
2018-10-11,5,"Needed a car quickly got just what we wanted in the price range we asked for, service was excellent, Our sales lady Bek went above and beyond and sorted everything out. Completely painless experience considering I was parting with a lot of cash.I would highly recommend.top class."
2018-10-11,5,"We purchased a used 2018 A-Class Mercedes. I can definitely recommend the company; On first contact the ladies on the front desk were pleasant and helpful and the Used Car Sales Executive that dealt with my purchase - Pete Ward - fully met my expectations. He was extremely helpful, and had excellent product knowledge. The vehicle on collection was presented very well indeed and the small amount of extra work promised was carried out to my satisfaction. My overall experience was more than positive and, much to my surprise, the car was handed over with more than half a tank of fuel rather than the customary egg cup full ! The showroom area was excellent, clean and accommodating, especially after the free coffee machine was mended !"
2018-10-11,5,"As always, reliable and efficient service."
2018-10-11,2,"Poor service throughout, assured one warranty job completed,returning to the dealership they admitted it had not been done.

Numerous other disappointments with treatment and quality of work on the scheduled service.
Car has covered 20000 miles and is excellent but I feel very disappointed with the whole experience at Nottingham dealership."
2018-10-11,5,Great easy and fast service
2018-10-11,2,Booked my mot in for 9.30am and walked up to Cobham high street to waste some time whilst I waited. I returned 90 minutes later and asked if my car was ready. I was then told that the MOT are not done on site as they take the cars to Hersham and return later that evening. You can imagine I began to panic as I was now stranded without a car. The service manager Ollie did his best to get my car done ASAP and he was very helpful. It wasn’t the garages fault but whoever phoned me on the booking line as it wasn’t made clear that it was going to take so long. Left the garage at 12.45pm so over three hours for what I thought was a simple drop off and wait. Very frustrating as all morning wasted.
2018-10-11,2,Nice and friendly but in technical ability pretty useless having repeatedly failed to resolve a simple problem of their causing and a total lack of communication unless you chase them. It has actually put me off getting another Mercedes.
2018-10-11,5,Brought car in for service was met by Jason. Courtesy car was ready and waiting for me as promised and Jason was the epitome of polite great customer service. Car was ready 2 hours earlier than expected which was bonus.
2018-10-11,5,"After poor experiences dealing with a major car manufacturer whose name begins with ""V"", I wanted to return to a premium marque. In the past I have had problems with upmarket cars, but I have also experienced good customer care during the resolution of this problems.

We walked in off the street at Inchcape Derby to look at a Jaguar XE I had seen on line. We were left free to wander around to look at their stock and only when we decided to look more closely at the car we had selected, did we venture into the showroom. We were greeted by Charlotte Brough, who became our principal contact during our subsequent purchase of the car. she was warm and friendly and following a brief discussion, she arranged for a test drive. All throughout the drive, she was chatty, informative and engaging. Upon our return to the showroom, we discussed finance arrangements and a part exchange for our current vehicle with Charlotte and Luke, the business manager, with sensible, informed debate and absolutely no pressure.

We decided to purchase the vehicle and agreed the terms and Charlotte subsequently sent the requisite paperwork via e-mail. After some minor amendments, amicably agreed, we completed the transaction as far as possible pending formal arrangements upon collection. Having agreed the collection date, we arrived and to be frank, we spent a lot of time engaged in chatting, such is the friendly atmosphere in the dealership.

After completing the arrangement and following a brief heads upon get us started functions of the car, Charlotte saw us off and took a video of us leaving in the car, which she sent to us - a nice touch. The whole experience was warm and friendly and Luke told us that the company now has a policy of selecting Sales Executives who do not necessarily have motor trade experience, preferring instead candidates who have proven customer care skills. In an age where customer care, especially in volume car manufacturers and dealers, is sadly lacking, this was a real breath of fresh air. I wish every week could be like the week we experienced."
2018-10-11,3,"The sales chap (Peter) was absolutely 1st class, 11 out of 10 throughout the process. Unfortunately, the car was a bit of a ‘dog’. On driving off realised it stank of damp Labrador and associated air con problem. Had to wait a few weeks to get it addressed. Both front tyres went flat the day after purchase and had to have them replaced at my cost. I guess these things sometimes just happen."
2018-10-11,5,the sales man Alan wood of Inchcape Land Rover Preston was very helpful in helping me find my 2018 Range Rover vogue and he was excellent after sales by helping me settle down with the new car he is based in Preston I will deal with him over and over again great guy .
2018-10-10,5,"I purchased a used Mini Coupe. Jason was extremely friendly and entertaining, but very professional at the same time. No pressurised selling going on. He took the time to go through the spec of the car with me and also connected my phone up. Car was valeted before I collected it. Would definitely recommend this dealership. So nice to be a Mini owner again!!"
2018-10-10,5,"Had a great service from the start with Brian Sheridan. From the first phone call to viewing, buying, sorting out extra and picking it up and aftercare. Peter was also really helpful and assisted me. I had not long blight another car from another dealer and the level of service at Cobham was absolutely fantastic. I traveled a long way to get the car I wanted and will be going to Brian again. Cant recommend them highly enough. After care is so important too and these guys get it right."
2018-10-10,4,"Very helpful staff both Scott and Olivia were great, answered all questions asked. I would definitely recommend them."
2018-10-10,5,"Excellent service particularly from Mark Williams on entering and leaving .
I would recommend this company to anyone"
2018-10-10,5,Excellent very good and video of service
2018-10-10,5,"absolutely brilliant service from inchcape Southampton.
Salesman James went through every aspect of the sale with me even dealing with the dvla removing my personalised number plate from my trade in vehicle to transferring to my purchased discovery sport . from the test drive to showing me all the controls, switches infotainment systems etc I cant fault the service highly recommended"
2018-10-10,5,"Really impressed with Mini Tonbridge - helpful staff, every time I go I get a great free courtesy car."
2018-10-10,5,"I was helped by Ben in the service department of Audi Maidstone
He was helpful and knowledgable. After telling him about a recent accident I had his consideration was grately appreciated.
I wouldn’t hesitate to go back here in the future for any repairs or services"
2018-10-10,5,Very helpful with no problems at all.
2018-10-10,5,All staff friendly and helpful
2018-10-09,5,"Waited there for service, very good customer service, nice coffee."
2018-10-09,3,Leicester dealership promised the earth and then after sales experience of buying a brand new Mercedes was irritating. We had to chase them up for everything on a number of occasions. Would try another dealership next time.
2018-10-09,5,"I cant fault this VW Main Agent for their expertise , meeting highest standards both technical and personal interaction time and time again. This recent repair left my car performance in tip top condition. I use this Agent because of their honesty and their genuine wish to achieve customer satisfaction in all that they do for me."
2018-10-09,5,The service department was efficient and the service receptionist was very helpful. Good experience.
2018-10-09,5,"Had my service & MOT done at Cooper Mini Reading... it was a free service but I felt like I was getting top dolllar. George was really accommodating, fab & such a nice, friendly man. The service guys also did a great job & I even got a video explaining what they’d done! Couldn’t recommend more highly 😊"
2018-10-09,1,Just had a response to my review in April ! Nice to know it’s being taken on board but over five months after the event - bit slow .
2018-10-09,5,"The technical staff and front of shop staff all seem to work in harmony. Explanations of work carried out where needed are concise and explained in detail. No question too hard for them to answer or find the answer to. Courteous at all times, helpful and friendly but more importantly not pushy. Great service and a comfortable place to wait if you need to. Wi-Fi available if needed."
2018-10-09,3,"Buying a 1 year old car to replace an older one, should have given me the feeling of elation, but it left me feeling quite flat and glad when it was all over. The salesman quite a nice young man and relatively new to the company, kept wandering off to clear almost every detail with the manager.
Initially we were going to trade-in our car, but changed our minds and paid cash, however we were still presented with an invoice including the trade-in and the offer of additional 1 year guarantee (£499) which we thought unusual as BMW vehicles have a 3 year manufacturers guarantee.Eventually we received the correct invoice without the trade-in and no mention of the warranty, then we were asked to sign a further 3 or 4 documents, one of which was appertaining to buying the vehicle on finance, which was totally irrelevant! Finally all the paperwork had been produced and sorted, we were then taken to the vehicle and allowed to leave. In summary, the sales people need to be better organised/trained and all paper work checked and ready, it took one and a half hours to conclude."
2018-10-09,5,Very efficient
2018-10-09,5,Fantastic Dealership with very help full staff with an exceptional knowledge of their product. I can recommend this dealership without any reservations. Will certainly be back for my next vehicle.
2018-10-09,5,"Good Customer Service. Great ambience. Pleasant surroundings.
Happy with the service and feedback given about the vehicle.
I love my Toyota."
2018-10-09,5,First time and was very well looked after.
2018-10-09,5,Very professional from start to finish and excellent customer service
2018-10-09,5,Wez and Chris were very professional and courteous. Wez took real care in ensuring I was happy at every stage of the sale
2018-10-09,4,"Arrived@ around 9am to find no where to park my vehicle and the staff walking around outside made no effort to help..
In the end I left my vehicle double parked and entered the dealership."
2018-10-09,5,"Great service, on time, car beautifully valeted, helpful staff. Recommend."
2018-10-09,5,"Car went in in the morning for a recall problem - was fixed and ready for collection mid afternoon, earlier than estimated time. Received a complimentary clean inside and out and a diagnostic test. Professional, quick and polite service."
2018-10-09,3,"it was a good service, but there was a problem with the clamps on my exhaust pipe and I was offered a new rear exhaust system for nearly £1200. I went to my local exhaust place after the service and had a repair for £36. Well I think Mercedes is the place to go for car servicing it’s clear That you should be very concerned about the desire to replace parts that don’t need replacing at great expense. On another day I might have accepted their offer and felt completely cheated.

I think Mercedes should consider their approach.

On other accounts the service I received was very good."
2018-10-09,2,In addition to my previous review. I got an email from the service Manager at Crawley Audi to resolve my experience to then be ignored on my last email. Once again awful customer service.
2018-10-09,4,Well managed; vehicle full service booked as scheduled and completed on time; kept fully informed before during and after; nothing unexpected and full service docs etc reviewed prior to hand over back to myself.
2018-10-09,4,Very nice and relaxing waiting area and was offered a drink. Very polite staff
2018-10-09,1,It takes them 3 hour to do MOT and then they promise a wash and vacuum on the car but they failed to vacuum. Lack of communication between staff on service.
2018-10-09,5,All in all a very professional and expedient service. They delivered exactly what was expected and to the promised timescales
2018-10-08,5,Excellent service very friendly
2018-10-08,5,"Great showroom , even better staff , we are looking for a used car for my son and even though we are in the early stages the service we received have put this place number 1 on the list, thank you Tunbridge Wells Audi"
2018-10-08,5,"Brilliant sales staff who were fantastic at helping me find my new car.

2018-10-08,1,"My car ended up on a low loader recovery truck after my service and recall work
I think you should contact the MD at Coopers BMW in. Durham for more details and a reimbursement package.
However the service receptionist Michelle was very polite and efficient and this is no reflection on her, she was the best part of my experience.
My car is still at the garage and my Sunday ruined

Update
10/10/2018
I received a speedy conclusion to this issue. BMW repaired my car and returned it to my home address at no extra cost. After passing the details onto the Complaint team i received a satisfactory apology and reconciliation offer.
I appreciate the quick response and my car is back to its original performance.
Please pass my thanks to Anthony in BMW Assist and Michelle in Durham who were very efficient."

2018-10-08,5,Great service and a fantastic car!
2018-10-08,5,Very helpful and excellent service
2018-10-08,4,"Very good car service experience on Saturday with Mark Williams managing it, no issues at all. However, apart from that, the Inchcape and BMW experience since taking delivery of our current car has been mediocre at best, unacceptable at worst as recently as two weeks ago. After 20 years a BMW and Inchcape customer, this car looks to be the last car we shall buy from them."
2018-10-08,4,"My car was in for a service:
Straightforward to book (but book well in advance if you need a courtesy car), with good communication from the service representative.
On arrival I was greeted straight away, I had a cup of tea in hand within minutes.
Paperwork was handled promptly by the service rep' (Phil in my case).
Everything was clearly explained, I never felt rushed, there was time for everything - even the last minute trade-in valuation I requested.
Reasonable service price for a main dealer (of any brand!).
The most minor of moans, is that my car wasn't valeted very well, (it was a complimentary service, but still!) - but I'm still very happy to put my name to a good review!"
2018-10-08,5,Excellent service. Car collected on time and dropped off earlier than expected.

Dear Mr. Strickland

SEVICING JOB No. 530099


I regret to say that on Friday 5th October I experienced what appeared to be a totally incompetent and shambolic after sales organisation and an arrogant technician who appeared totally incapable of recognising or accepting responsibility.
Having booked a MOT three months in advance I arrived at reception at 7.55 am, and was advised that having arrived early I could wait for the work to be completed. I had planned to set off at 6.00 am the following morning to join my children in the Lake District.
Fifteen minutes after arriving I was advised by James Hedley that my vehicle on board computer indicated the need for an oil change, and I agreed to this being carried out. I was not shown any paperwork or asked to sign any approval for work to be carried out. Recognising that an oil change would extend the service time I went home.
At 11.34 am I received an email on my phone with an attached health check video which would not open, and I immediately telephoned the service team on 02081811571. The female receptionist was unable to contact anyone who could provide information on the status of my vehicle, and promised a return call. No follow up return call was made.
During the afternoon I made three further telephone calls and had the same response on each occasion but not a single return call was made. On the last call I pointed out that with the serious traffic chaos in Kingston, I would be making a one hour walk to Thame Ditton and would appreciate a call before setting off. This was promised but once again I never received a response.

I arrived at your facility shortly before 5.30 pm, but once again James Hedley could not be reached, although it was quite obvious that he was chatting to other employees in the forecourt. After a twenty minute wait he arrived at his desk and started making calls to allow him to initiate starting my paperwork. I strongly objected to a large vehicle service check charge which I had not requested, or signed for. The vehicle had in fact done only 3000 miles in the last year because I had been away. He very rudely then stated that I pay in full or the vehicle remained locked up until Monday.
Having recognised that in this situation my only alternative was to pay and return on Monday, I noted that the bottom line of my invoice stated “nail in offside rear tyre”. Despite four telephone calls no one had bothered to tell me this, and I advised James Hedley that I believed that the garage was behaving in a highly irrespirable manner, and that safety did not appear to be high on the agenda.
The net result of the repeated failures of your after sales department, was that I was forced to cancel my trip to my children in the Lake District over the weekend.
To add insult to injury, I noted when I arrived home, that my MOT certificate had been incorrectly completed, and was left wondering whether you had serviced the right vehicle!"
2018-10-08,5,Very efficient and friendly
2018-10-08,2,"Not an experience I would like to repeat.I certainly did not feel like a valued customer ,having only spent 30k on a used car probably didn’t qualify me any special treatment.once the deposit was paid that appeared to be me finished.Salesman difficult to contact ,always “away from his desk ,with a customer or off for the day”
The handover was hurried ,car dripping wet,cup marks left on the interior dash,I could go on but can’t be bothered (a bit like Audi Tunbridge Wells really)"
2018-10-08,5,"Service was excellent, everyone was helpful and extremely pleasant, Our used car sales consultant was 6 stars. We needed some follow up advice/help, this was no problem, 1st class."
2018-10-08,5,"Efficient & Slick

Customer service was exceptional, I'll definitely be using Inchcape for future servicing needs."
2018-10-08,4,"My visit to the dealership on Saturday did on this occasion complete the tasks on time
The reception staff made me feel a valued customer and on arrival I was welcomed with a coffee and a newspaper
Keep up these standards we’ll done"
2018-10-08,5,"I recently purchased a new car from this dealership and the sales person I dealt with was Katie Needham.
All I can say is that Katie was above and beyond my expectations. She was extremely professional and attentive to all my needs. Inchcape should be extremely proud of having an employee like ger.
Should I purcgase another car in the future I will be searching for Katie. Kind regards and thank you. Andy Hicks."
2018-10-08,5,"Impressive service from start to finish

Alex H of Ipswich was able to guide me through the process of buying an approved Used car on PCP, answering all my questions(stupid or otherwise). Always helpful, never pushy, and knowledgeable on the products I was interested in.

I will see you in 3 years time for that X2 20d Msport Alex!"
2018-10-08,4,"Lovely showroom, welcoming staff,clear and precise paperwork. Good experience would certainly go back again"
2018-10-08,5,"Inchcape Altrincham are fantastic - they are so professional and like a member of my family at the same time. I have dealt with them for a long time and I have to say their service from the reception staff to Gayle in Service and then the wonderful Dave Sherwood in Sales. They go above and beyond. I have also had dealing with the technicians too who are also great too and never let you leave without being 100% happy with your car.

Would highly recommend to anyone."
2018-10-08,5,Was a very professional service
2018-10-07,2,"New customer to Mercedes.... not impressed!

Having purchased my new vehicle privately, I noted it was due a B1 service. I decided to pay that extra bit in the hope I would receive a pleasant service. I was wrong...... serviced my car yes, but did not wash car, did not clean car, and messed all my preferred vehicle & seat setting too. Took me ages to sort given I had only purchased the car a week earlier.

I've moved from owning a BMW for 8 years. Having had my car serviced through their dealers, I find Mercedes dealer customer service poor. This is to put it mildly.

I will be thinking twice before making a future booking."
2018-10-07,5,"Ouststanding communication throughout. Service that goes beyond expectations and a beautifully maintained and prepared vehicle.
Add to this delivery to suit our arrangements and you have provided a wining service."
2018-10-07,5,"Very good service, friendly and professional, regular communication throughout the process and loved the video of my car and explanation"
2018-10-07,5,"Great Experience at Cooper BMW, Chelmford.
Livvy was a first class service agent."
2018-10-07,5,From start to finish I received first class customer service. Absolutely no complaints. Thank you
2018-10-06,5,"The only issue I have raised direct with the manager. Otherwise the service from Alastair and colleagues was excellent, and I received the visual audit of my car by e-mail to watch for myself. Impressive technology."
2018-10-06,4,Car was booked in for safety recall work. It was taken into the workshop promptly and I was able to drive away again about an hour later. Comfortable waiting area with free wifi.
2018-10-06,5,"Thanks to Kyle and Claire for looking after the Service of my 435, and for liaising with Jake on the sales team to provide us with the fantastic M4 demonstrator for the day.
Unrivalled service from BMW and I've owned Mercedes, Range Rover, Jaguar and Audi over the previous years.
Unfortunately the M4 competion pack seats were a bit too snug for my wide rib cage, so will stick with the fabulously fast and frugal 435d for now."
2018-10-06,4,"Pleasant, professional, on time.
Unsurprisingly expensive, dreadful onsite parking."
2018-10-06,1,"Very disappointing experience trying to buy a 40k X5.
I took me to call 5 times to get anyone to answer the phone. Finally spoke to a salesman called Danny. Made him a offer for the car which he said would need to speak to his manager about. I waited and he never called back. Phoned 4 times over the next 2 days and he never got back to me. Finally I asked for the dealership manager to call me and guess what I am still waiting. I went and bought another car somewhere."
2018-10-05,1,"Useless dealership, had mine and my brothers car serviced there for the last 3 years now. Tried to book a service this year and test drive the new c class whilst car was being serviced, took me 8 week to arrange this, not once did they call me back, 15 calls later they told me to book my service from there central hub then arrange the test drive which was total crap. Got fed up and rand the dealership service department direct and booked the service. A day before my service asked if I could test drive the new c class to which they confirmed was ok after talking to the rude receptionist. When I got there the next day they had a old c class estate waiting for me. Couldn’t even be bothered to question the incompetent staff. At this point just wanted to get my car serviced and leave the dealership ASAP. Don’t bother with the sales staff there and the receptionist thinks she owns the place. They don’t know what there doing at all."
2018-10-05,5,"The most excellent friendly service from start to finish in purchasing my new Jaguar E.pace.
Chris Shaw could not have done more to find the right car for us and conclude a really good deal. Marco Roberts drove the vechical from Chester to Stratford upon Avon to deliver the new car and take the part exchange back. He did all the paperwork at my home and spent a good 90 minutes going over all the gadgets on the car. A really nice guy, extremely patient and enthusiastic. Well done Jaguar Chester you have two very happy clients!"
2018-10-05,5,Very helpful and welcoming. Spent a great deal of time explaining the purchase. Sales person Derek highly recommended by me.
2018-10-05,5,Yes very professional would certainly consider using them in the future.
2018-10-05,5,Listened to what we wanted. Spent the time to help us consider options. Was not pressured at any stage.
2018-10-05,1,"I put a £1000 deposit on a brand new car with this dealership, only to be told 2 days later it had been sold. They offered me an alternative which was more expensive and expected me to take them up on this- I declined.
I requested my deposit back to which I was informed that I would have it back with me within a week and it had been processed.
I am now 3 weeks further on with still no deposit returned and being told a constant stream of lies.

I would advise anyone to steer clear of this dealership."
2018-10-05,1,After recall notice could not get booking for two weeks. Was very explicit re further two problems. Having taken car in was then advised that parts were required to complete the work- even though they had requested the car to be returned! Rang to speak to service manager - never called back. Finally it was impossible to contact service dept by phone to arrange pickup; rang four times & could not get through. Really not good service at all
2018-10-05,1,"When picking up my car after the service:
1. The service manager explained that my windscreen wipers needed changing and that the tread on my tyres was low.
2. He then tried to charge me for the service even though I am on a service plan.
3. On realising his mistake he went to the other customer (which he had the details for) and completed his checkout rather than getting my correct details. I was waiting for 20 mins for my keys.
4 I thought the point of a service plan was that it was quick and easy."
2018-10-05,4,Service was brilliant but then it should have been given that the drivers door mirror failed less than a week after our brand new X2 was delivered.
2018-10-05,5,"Very welcoming & efficienct service from Mini, Cooper at Chelmsford. Staff very friendly & great communication received."
2018-10-05,5,"Done the work needed to be done efficiently and in reasonable time. Very friendly staff and coffee on hand, very pleased."
2018-10-05,3,"Booked in for service and was waiting at the garage whilst this was being completed, was told it would be approximately 1½ hours but ended up being there for over 3 hours. There was only 1 member of staff dealing with the cars coming in/going out on the service side and she was very busy. No-one forthcoming with details on the delay. Car was serviced and parked ready to go for at least ½ hour and eventually had to ask ""how much longer"" before anything was done."
2018-10-05,4,Efficient and friendly service as usual!!
2018-10-05,5,Purchased our new E Class with sales consultant Simeon Mitchell dealing with us. We had a really good experience throughout and the service and attention from Simeon was excellent. Thanks to Nathan Winson for great service aswell.
2018-10-05,5,Service as good as always. Top class.
2018-10-05,1,"Warrington Mercedes absolute disgrace, they have had out vehicle for 5 weeks, still NO diagnostic. Customer service is appalling no update from the showroom, we keep calling to get answer from them they don't seem to know what they are doing. I have just rang (05/10/18 aprox 11.05 & 11.10) to speak to somebody in the Warrington it rings out and after 3 minutes and 11 second the customer service line terminates your call. Disgusting service please think twice when using Warrington Service department as they are useless."
2018-10-05,1,"I was overcharged by £315 by Inchcape Mercedes-Benz for the first year's road tax when I purchased a GLC 250d. After obtaining written proof from DVLA, Inchcape agreed to repay the overcharged amount which took several weeks to arrive. No apology, not even a ""with compliments slip"" enclosed with the cheque.
Apparently the Inchcape invoicing system has incorrect road tax data, so anyone who purchased a similar car after 1st April 2018 will also have been overcharged. I expected better from a Mercedes-Benz dealership."
2018-10-05,5,"No complaints, helpful easy to deal with friendly staff. Any issues were dealt with quickly."
2018-10-04,5,"I was met with a friendly greeting, welcome and coffee. The service manager explained about the service and approximately how long it would take. I was offered use of the waiting area which had a tv, newspapers and free drinks. I received a video showing what had been carried out by the technician who worked on my car. I also received a call from the service manager informing me my car was ready. All in all a very satisfying and problem free visit,"
2018-10-04,5,"I recently bought a used mini from Cooper Teesside and feel the need review and to share my experience of this purchase and Mini Cooper Teesside with others who may be interested in a similar purchase. What can I say except a fantastic experience ! From my initial visit/enquiry to pick up day the whole process was very pleasurable. The car was perfect, gleamingly clean and smelt like a brand new car. The instruments in the car were clearly explained to me and the whole mini experience has left me with a big smile on my face. Well done Mini Cooper Teesside (the coffee was lovely) and in particular David the Salesman who made sure I was 100% happy with my purchase. I would definitely return if I ever get bored of my new mini and will recommend you to friends and family."
2018-10-04,4,very helpful staff esp alex
2018-10-04,1,"Do not be impressed by the new luxurious showroom, as behind the scenes the running of this dealership is an absolute shambles. The staff have no understanding of even basic customer service, they are rude, dismissive and certainly not a representation of what the Jaguar Land Rover brand aspires and portrays itself to be.

Inchcape Preston completely misdiagnosed, what I’ve now been advised, is a well known common fault on my F Type, that I reported to them during a service whilst the car was under warranty - they advised me the fault wasn’t an issue and not to worry - now the warranty has expired, suddenly the same issue has conveniently been identified as an urgent fix that they are trying to force me to pay - at the hefty cost of £1600+VAT - due to their complete misdiagnosis of the problem when I originally reported it under warranty.

Their service department communication has always been absolutely horrendous prior to this issue - no one returns calls or keeps you updated as they promise, they can’t even manage the logistics of arranging a courtesy car competently.

Now due to this issue caused by their misdiagnosis, they are refusing to take my calls or have a meeting in person to discuss my position, will not communicate with me or accept they are at fault - disgusting that as a paying and loyal customer I am being completely dismissed - even to the point where I have an email from them asking me to take my business elsewhere.

Inchcape Preston have miscommunicated dates on email to make it look like I reported the problem later than I did (although I have the correct records myself from their own booking systems) and they advised me they had ‘lost’ my job card where the issue they have misdiagnosed was originally logged, how convenient.

Inchcape Preston have not honoured the promised grace period for any post warranty expiry issues - even when the issue was originally reported by myself when the vehicle still had 5 months warranty remaining!

The service offered by Inchcape Preston is absolutely appalling and falls well short of the premium brand they are trying, and failing, to represent, a complete lack of even basic customer service alongside technicians working on prestige vehicles who clearly do not know what they are doing.

They need to rebrand themselves as Inchcapable. I strongly advise you consider other dealerships to avoid having to go through the horrendous and time consuming experience I've had."
2018-10-04,5,The experience I had at Mercedes Leicester was excellent from the salesman (Aj) and his boss (Alvin). Both members of the team were more than accommodating and went above and beyond in helping me choose my car and learn how to use it. Would definitely recommend this branch of dealership.
2018-10-04,5,very courteous quick and professional
2018-10-04,5,The staffs are helpful and efficient
2018-10-04,5,Very good customer service and attention to detail. Would highly recommend.
2018-10-04,3,"I had problems with this Service visit from the first phone call - the young lady spoke so fast, I could not understand anything she said on my answer phone. When I phone Inchcape Chester, they were very nice & put me through to call centre - were a young man booked me in. He was the same I had to keep asking him to slow down and repeat himself - I've never had this problem before are they on speed booking or something????
At Inchcape Chester, the staff are very nice and helpful - but there is very little thought given to disabled people and where they will sit etc during their wait for the car.
The lounge seats are so low and far back I could not get into them. The coffee tables are even lower. The seats at the tables, are OK, but hard after 10 mins. There is no decaff coffee or tea - disappointed about this. Not all disabled people are in wheelchairs and consideration should be given to where we can sit comfortably for 2 hrs while we wait for our cars - I know you have a very good pick up & deliver back service but I can't afford to lose my car for a full day - it is my lifeline."
2018-10-04,5,"Called by without an appointment in an emergency situation ,warm welcome and immediate attention from a services executive who kept me updated throughout my wait.Problem was solved within an hour and I was able to continue on my journey.First class service,thank you."
2018-10-04,1,"Really bad.
had I3 serviced in Ipswich. two days later car had smoke coming from rear.
they had left off the oil filler cap.. oil every where.
car returned without explanation,
had phoned the branch two weeks before to arrange for parts to be fitted., no one phoned back. parts not available on service.
Loud music in branch, loads of staff wandering around carrying post-it notes., No one serving customers"
2018-10-04,2,Had to wait 40 minutes in the waiting area to collect our car after its service despite having received a text hours earlier in the day informing the car was ready for collection. The lady on receiption was at fault for not making the service team aware we had arrived. After 30 minutes of being ignored the same lady was rude and dismissive when we asked if they’d forgotten about us.
2018-10-04,5,Excellent service with no waiting and everything explained clearly - great job
2018-10-04,2,"I arrived at the dealership and spoke to a lady explaining I needed some Adblue as indicated on my dashboard. Also I needed assistance to pair up my phone with the app I had on my phone which the car sales person did for me when I purchased the new Passat. I was told by the lady there was a 15 minutes wait and offered me a coffee while I waited.
Over 30 minutes had passed by and she noticed I was still waiting and asked if I had been seen to, which I replied NO, she then said she would chase them up. Shortly afterwards a young man came out and asked for my keys to do the Adblue top up. He returned after 10 minutes and I could see he had over filled it as my rear offside wheel and tyre was covered and he had given the paint work area a quick wipe but it looking aulfull. He tryed to improve the paint area but it looked poor and the wheel and tyre was left.
He then spent 20 minutes plus trying to pair up my mobile after finding it did not have a unit fitted. But still could not solve the problem. Another gentleman came out saying he would carry on as he was urgently required. A further 10/15 minutes passed bye and he was successful after finding the unit had not been fitted correctly.
I thanked him for his assistance and left the dealership not too impressed."
2018-10-04,3,"Book my car in for 2 new tyres while i waited I was asked which 1 hour time wanted so I went for 10.30 am , very present but I was still waiting at 12.30 for my car . Over 2 hours for tyres seems very long to me . But all Mercedes seem to have this problem .
I use them because I need to not out of choice ."
2018-10-04,4,"We were dealt with by the used car sales manger Stephen Robson. He treated us with contempt and as if we were stupid. His first comment was ""are you buying this car today or what!"", He said that he had put the car on the market at the wrong price and would be upping it after the weekend. He forgot to mention it was the end of the month and the car was priced to sell. He tried to pressurize us into buying the car before the weekend because if we didn't it would effect his end of month sales figures, this was during a phone call to my house after we had left dealers and had arrived home. I thought this was very unprofessional The car required some work doing to it on the upholstery and paintwork but he wanted us to sign for the car before we were satisfied with the completed work. He sent us some photographs of work that had allegedly been done to the car and expected us to sign the order form. We went back to see the car for final inspection on Monday the 1st October and despite not signing any order form he had the car registered in my name and purchased a years road tax, very presumptuous of him as I still hadn't said I was definitely having the car. I must say his attitude to us was poor, dealing with other customers at the same time as us and kept us hanging about longer than necessary. The gentlemen that took us a on test drive and the one who finally signed the deal were completely different and not belligerent at all and treated us well."
2018-10-04,5,"I arrived with no appointment at the reception desk and explained my situation and the difficulties I was experiencing with my car. Between them, the team ensured that the fault on my car was diagnosed and fixed within a few hours. Their kindness and commitment to helping me was exceptional and enormously appreciated."
2018-10-04,5,I loved it its full of sugar daddies
2018-10-04,5,"Excellent, and personalised level of care. Kept up to date with order and delivery. Smooth handover of new discovery. Strongly recommend."
2018-10-04,5,"I really enjoyed dealing with Inchcape Land Rover Guildford. Peter Steede, the person I dealt with , was extremely helpful and had a huge grasp of customer service and how to keep the customer happy at all times. I have nothing but praise for him.

More generally, I thought that they were a very professional, high-quality outfit. They were never ""pushy"" in trying to sell me a car. They let me make my own mind up and, sure enough, I bought a beautiful car from them!!"
2018-10-04,5,Brilliant experience at VW Chester. Cam Belt and water pump done. Ace communication will defiantly be returning to the garage
2018-10-04,5,Great staff and good communication. Just a shame that we get asked to write reviews all the time.
2018-10-04,5,Excellent service from Josh my service adviser at Coopers BMW at Preston Farm.
2018-10-04,5,Great Staff looking after every need of the customer
2018-10-03,1,"Very poor customer service
Seemed poorly staffed waited 40 mins to hand over keys , coffee machine broken not a nice experience, looking to change my car next week, will look else where

Ian"
2018-10-03,5,"Excellent customer service by Lexus Nottingham, Derby Road. Big shout out to Dean (and Andrew who were extremely professional, knowledgable and accommodating. They listened to what I wanted in my car and customised the car to my preference and it’s fabulous. The delivery of the new car was on time. Loved the personal touch with the flowers."
2018-10-03,5,Great service everything went smooth and good communication
2018-10-03,4,"Last year the Receptionist took us to the seating area, offered and made us drinks. This time when we checked in at reception she just said ""ok the Service team will see you in a moment"". We were not shown to the waiting area or offered any drinks.

The service team who dealt with me were fine. However, when I used the toilets in the Showroom area, none of the staff acknowledge me with for example a simple ""Good Morning"" or a smile. Being ignored doesn't project a very friendly atmosphere.

Tim Port is always very good in terms of Customer Service."
2018-10-03,4,"Nice clean area in the showroom, my car was ready in the hour as said,Down side coffee machine out of action, the car cleaned and vac out, not the best !"
2018-10-03,3,"Great sales staff, polite service attendants, poor experience booking and generally left feeling unvalued.

Many attempts to call to arrange a service have ended up with me being bounced around between frankly rude service booking agents who don't seem to care (locally - not at a national call centre). I was recently confirmed for a booking, had them call me back to say the part I needed wasn't available and was on back order. I needed to take the car in anyway for a minor repair and surprise, surprise, the part was available. They were too busy to wash the car (again!) so I can only conclude the call the previous day to put me off was purely to try and manage a workload that was too much for the site to manage.

I rarely get the car back clean (last two services, it hasn't even been washed!) and to be honest, if I'm going to spend £50k+ on a car and a service plan I do expect to be made to feel a little bit special, no matter how small I am in the scheme of things... quite honestly, if I'd spent anything with them they should be grateful and respectful... regardl of the amount. In the end, I have complained to the head office... great sales experience and a mediocre (at best!) after sales.

Oh, and google reviews don't seem to work for me via the email link that prompted me to write this - it seems to keep asking me to log in. About as good as the Mercedes me app that keeps telling me my car is unlocked when it isn't.

Not Good Enough"
2018-10-03,5,"I recently purchased a brand new 1 Series from Cooper Teesside. Nick, who assisted me, was amazing! From moment 1, the service he provided was 5*. Nick was informative, knowledgeable and seemed to care about my.choice and was sure to include my family in the decision making. Through out the process, Nick sent me updates on my vehicle and called with information. At hand over, he explained everything and was, as previous, very attentive. Even the after service from Nick has been excellent. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Nick and Cooper Teesside. Thank you for making it so easy and a joy!"
2018-10-03,5,Great service nothing to much for them
2018-10-03,5,"Great communication, slick professional service"
2018-10-03,5,This is the 4th mini I have bought from Cooper Teesside .Excellent car and excellent service .Never felt pushed or pressured by Martin Jones and he listened to exactly what I wanted .Many Thanks. Allison Lancashire
2018-10-03,2,Dropped car off at bmw Cooper Cobham at 8:30am and was told it would be ready to collect at 4pm. Turned up at 4:30pm to collect it and had to sit and wait for an hour while they done the service as it hadn’t even been started when I arrived at 4:30! That’s the last time I will leave the car all day and in future will sit and wait so they do it straight away. Unfortunately it has gone down hill over the last few years and it’s not the first time I’ve had a poor experience there recently and i doubt it will be the last! I’ve also since emailed them about the next service due as it’s only in 3000 miles time which is not right but have yet to get a response!
2018-10-03,5,"Friendly staff, good knowledge with clear explanation of vehicle and financial options. Good handover of new vehicle with everything done so I had nothing to worry about doing just enjoy my new Toyota Auris Hybrid."
2018-10-03,5,"We dealt with Leonni Etchells and I must say that the service she gave us was second to none, a very pleasant and professional young lady who worked hard to find the exact vehicle we were looking for.
If and when I’m in the market for a replacement vehicle I can honestly say that she will be our first contact."
2018-10-03,5,Very good customer service and while you wait area.
2018-10-03,5,Excellent service and MOT - work completed quickly and for the price quoted.
2018-10-03,5,Is very friendly and professional service helpings. I’m happy with any time I bring my car to this place for service
2018-10-03,5,Excellent level of service
2018-10-03,4,Was good service very helpful and quick only reason not 5 is due to the car washer didn't do a good job car was still dirty
2018-10-03,5,"I have used Cooper BMW Durham for servicing and parts plus I've bought two cars in the last two years. On each occasion the experience has been outstanding. I'd recommend to anyone,"
2018-10-03,5,"Smooth transection, even it was distance sale but Leon has describe the vehicle accurately and delivery driver has take out time to explain us full functionality of our new vehicle. Excellent job done by all the staff who was involve in our purchase."
2018-10-03,5,"First class service, have been so well looked after, from the moment I walked through the door after walking out of another company because of the way I was treated. I came to you for a look around, ended up buying a car, and haven’t been disappointed, I would recommend you both for sales and service."
2018-10-03,5,"Having a service plan for my Tiguan R line makes the whole experience worry free. Will certainly use Inchcape Chester Wolkswagon again,thank you"
2018-10-03,2,It would help if people handing car back after MOT are more friendly and welcoming rather than trying to get rid. I've owned a BMW in past and had an amazing customer service experience. S
2018-10-03,5,"Excellent helpful service staff, prepared to go beyond what is expected.
Everything dealt with clearly and exactly as promised.
Particular mention goes to John Whithorn who could not have been more friendly and helpful, thank you."
2018-10-03,2,Far too long waiting for a simple job to replace one cable. All the customers felt the same. Three and half hours!! Not impressed
2018-10-03,2,"I arrived at 11.00am to collect my car and expected to leave around 12.00. However the car wasn’t ready and I was told repeatedly that it would just be a few minutes more. In fact it took 4 hours. The salesman, Harj, knew that the car was not going to be ready on time so why didn’t he ring and reschedule the appointment. During this time, although we were offered coffee, there was no food. If we had been told the truth at the beginning, we could have made other arrangements. When I finally got the car it was obvious that it had not been properly valeted and indeed had to be taken back into the body shop to have scratches removed. The spare key was missing which was only discovered at the last minute. I am still waiting for a replacement. I find this level of preparation and service to be very poor especially as it is supposed to represent Mercedes. I hope my future encounters with the brand to be of a higher quality."
2018-10-03,5,Very happy with the service received. Very punctual and kept me up to date. The walkthrough video of my car was a nice touch and the fact it came back clean even better! Would recommend Inchcape Manchester.
2018-10-02,1,"I feel I have been mis sold Gaurd X cover
The sales advisor did speak to us about it and we confirmed we did not want it.
When I received my fiancial agreement it had been added without me being informed it was not discussed at the handover. When I contacted the sales advisor Range Rover in Chester via email regarding this issue his answers were quite flipant and the issue still has not been resolved"
2018-10-02,1,"I booked my car in for its first service, even though it only had 5300 miles on the clock. I used the dealers Internet Web site, and got quoted £230, but when I got to the garage, I was told it would be £445 because they insisted that I had the pollen filter changed also, How this doubled the price of the service is very puzzling and they went on to say that if I didn't comply with the computer recommendation, they would not reset the service light on the dash, I reluctantly agreed. But why did it give me the option for an oil change service at £230, when it wasn't available! I feel like I have been ripped off, and won't be returning again."
2018-10-02,5,excelent service and very helpful staff
2018-10-02,3,"1. Carbodywork quote was not provided whilst at garage during service inspite of being booked.
2. As service specification defined by key check at desk expected service duration was longer than advised.
3. Due to relative locations of home and Cooper BMW, travelling time between and need to use time effectively I decided to work with my laptop at the garage. This would have been more comfortable if there were hot desks available for customers in this situation. Spare desks for salespersonnel were available and not in use - need I say more!"
2018-10-02,5,seamless service thank you
2018-10-02,4,Michelle was fabulous and extremely helpful. Service was amazing but the only thing that annoyed me was the lady on reception. I visited front desk on return to pick up my car. Engaged in a conversation by asking if everything was ok. Then she continued to ignore me and move across to another woman. Very rude
2018-10-02,5,"Recent experience with Mercedes Nottm very pleased . car collected for service gentleman polite ,car returned full service and hoovered and washed thanks guys 😁
Overall experience excellent"
2018-10-02,4,"The Test drive was excellent and the saleman (Morgan) did a great job in a very relaxed but professional way. The car layout/features/benefits were explained thoroughly in a way that was easy to understand without focussing too much on the technical specification.

The only problems were with the digital 'paperwork' once the decision to buy had been made. I appreciate it was the end of the month and targets need to be met but the admin manager needs to explain the process - most people do not buy a new car every year and will not be familiar with 'documents' or their associated legal requirements.

I would also advise that in 2018 the generic term Ms is the better default title to be used for women customers. That way, regardless of whether in your day-to-day life you use MRS/MISS/MS, the DVLA/CREDIT/INSURANCE documentation is not going to be incorrect and need amending."
2018-10-02,5,Always excellent service from Inchcape Macclesfield
2018-10-02,2,"I booked my service on line for 10am. I noted that I would ‘wait’ and the web site advised it would take about 1 hr 30min. On arrival at 9.50 I became a little worried as one man was complaining why no one had come to take his car from him as he had a young child with him. He sounded very frustrated. Ryan came to meet me and take my car. He went through the paperwork and asked to confirm I had asked for a litre of oil. I had not, and he took it off the bill. He was polite and efficient. He told me it could take 2 to 3 hours. I heard another couple complain that they had no record of them booking a courtesy car. It appeared very disorganised, with poor communication or lack of staff. I decided to go home and received a call to say my car was finished. I am not a mechanic so could not comment on the service and have no complaints. My main issue is 1. the cost £396.80 for an inspection and oil change on an A3 11733 miles. 2. The perceived lack of customer care. They did have a nice digital sign showing all the people who were going to pick up their new car. Maybe the priority is sales not service. I will try to avoid this dealership in future."
2018-10-02,5,Alan Cook did a wonderful job in finding me the perfect car to suit my requirements. He kept in regular contact through the week before I collected it. Nothing was too much trouble and Alan made sure the car was immaculate. Alan is a great asset to Inchcape and I would wholeheartedly recommend him.
2018-10-02,4,"Booked in for a service and was looked after well by the staff. Pleasantly surprised as this was the first time that I had my car serviced at a franchised garage. Prices were reasonable, a video of the underside of my car was sent via text/email, which could surprise many people who know nothing about cars."
2018-10-02,5,"Efficient, Friendly, Pleasant and Polite response and service, where you feel you are valued and listened to as a customer."
2018-10-02,1,"I was overcharged in march for an item which was not used during a service of a 12 month E class. They admitted that they haven't used the item and said they would refund me . I am still waiting. The last communication said they could not refund me from warrington it would have to come from London. Since then they are not responding to my e mails.
I change my car every two years. It is unlikely the next one in January will be a mercedes . My neighbour changed from mercedes to volvo and tells me the volvo garage in warrington is excellent."
2018-10-02,5,excellent service
2018-10-02,1,"Avoid at all costs!
Inchcape West London Volkswagen. Definitely not ‘Completely Satisfied’, not even ‘Slightly Satisfied’.

I have had two cars from this dealership & without exception, every interaction over five years has been disappointing.

The telephone is shabbily answered & the person is always disinterested & poorly trained.

The Sales representatives are probably the best part of this dealership, especially Brett, who is up against it there.

The Service Department is shocking - It is nearly impossible to get a lift anywhere whilst your car is serviced. You have to wait approx 3 weeks for a courtesy car (they’re a car dealership!!!!)
Our car usually comes back with just a cursory wash & again the impression is that they just don’t care what you think.
Added to this, their service is considerably dearer than Qwikfit down the road. (You are led to believe that in a PCP you have to have your service done there).
There is an overwhelming sense at this dealership that you are totally unimportant to them.
They’ve got a great building & that’s really about it - if only everything else was as nice."
2018-10-02,5,"Met on time by engineer, who explained clearly what work needed to be done and how long it would take. I waited in the comfortable reception area.
It was completed early."
2018-10-02,5,"Good communication and services offered - decent price. A real effort being made as well to ensure excellent customer service. Sue Laver dealt with me at Tunbridge Wells Audi and was great. Very friendly, explained everything and a pleasure to deal with."
2018-10-02,1,Terrible service
2018-10-02,5,Fast and efficient service; would use again.
2018-10-02,5,Fast reliable service
2018-10-02,5,"Communication excellent from start to finish
Customer care superb. Denise kept us well informed"
2018-10-02,5,"Very affable, polite, effective and prompt representative, have great experience purchasing my BMW X5 recently, highly recommended."
2018-10-02,5,"From the start of my journey to order a private contract hire Velar , Inchcape York have been first class ! Trying to support me throughout the process , initially with Chris and finally put the deal together with Andrew Ball . It’s a challenging process but the effective & efficient procedure was executed in a professional but friendly manner .
I would whole heartily recommend this dealership and particularly ask for Andrew Ball privat"
2018-10-02,5,"I didn’t intend on purchasing a car as soon as I did. I was weighing up my different options. Stuart wolfendale is the guy who dealt with me and my purchase. Have never bought a car from a dealership before and Stuart was really helpful in guiding me through this. My big concern was offloading my old car to ensure I was able to secure the VW Scirocco I wanted; this is due to other dealerships not offering me anything for my previous car. Stuart was able to offer me a price I had in mind already with extras. From start to finish I was dealt with in a professional manner and this continues with email updates which is nice to have. Deffo recommend as a place to buy, and recommend Stuart as someone to help out someone in future."
2018-10-01,5,"Very professional, friendly and personable staff. Nobody minded me taking my hyper kids and grumpy little pug in the showroom. I didn’t feel pressurised into making decisions, and felt comfortable and confident about buying from this company. Efficient and very quick process. I’m a very happy customer."
2018-10-01,5,An Excellent Experience
2018-10-01,5,"First class service from initial enquiry to collection. Deals are keenly priced, and one's requirements are noted so there's no attempt to sell additional services which are not really necessary, which is quite unusual in my experience. Show room is excellently laid out.

Well worth a visit in my view if one's interested in a BMW."
2018-10-01,1,"Had to park on the main road when dropping off - far to busy. Not ideal for a 50+k X5.
Collection as above, but squeezed into an end back of an overflow car park.
Called for an update at 2:00pm - the service adviser was ""with customers"" and would call me back. No contact for 2 hours, so called again for an update. Same as above. No call back. Headed to the garage at 5. Was eventually called back when sat opposite the service adviser...
Same poor service as always from cooper Teesside, never look forward to visiting and this most recent experience hasn't changed this."
2018-10-01,5,"Sam and Ollie were outstanding across the whole process. From initial meeting, help with specification of the car through to delivery.

Always helpful, enthusiastic and available.

Great service!

Recommended"
2018-10-01,5,"The staff that I had contact with at Coopers BMW Reading, (on the telephones, via e mails and in person), were all very polite, very amiable people, combined with being efficient and extremely helpful. They replied in very quick time to any questions I had regarding my potential purchase. Steve Champion helped me over the phone and made me a personal video of the car I was interested in - he got the sale!. (I live at quite a distance from the Reading branch so bought the car over the phone)
Once I had made a decision, everyone helped to make my purchase day very quick and easy. Lovely coffee on arrival after a fairly long journey and then a very thorough run through all the paperwork and finance, and a fantastic demonstration of all the features of my new car before I drove away. Really excellent customer service. Special shout for Rebecca Mileham and Matt Gilbert in used car sales upstairs, who helped me in my initial contact phase, when I was undecided what I was looking for. I felt very well looked after by all. Thank you."
2018-10-01,5,"Cooper BMW Tunbridge Wells
Excellent service from the staff at Cooper BMW Tunbridge Wells throughout the exchange from one car to another."
2018-10-01,5,A great company to do business with. Everybody was so helpful from start to finish.As we were about to drive away David said any thing you don't understand or you need any help please call in and see us.
2018-10-01,5,Outstanding customer service and experience - I would recommend Inchcape Jaguar Derby to anyone
2018-10-01,5,Very prompt service and courteous staff would definitely recommend without hesitation
2018-10-01,5,"our salesman (Adam) was an expert on the Mini brand & there wasn't anything he didn't know. His sales technique was direct and informative, but not pushy in any way. He clearly made every effort to get us the car and deal we wanted...... reason enough to purchase my wife's new ""Mini Cooper S"" from Cooper Ipswich."
2018-10-01,5,"From placing my order Inchcape have been fantastic, I was loaned a curtesy car at no extra cost and Wayne the sales executive along with the rest of the team have helped in the process of my purchase.

I have no hesitation in recommending them and am sure I will be back for a new car in the future."
2018-10-01,5,"Good and prompt service, with the best price. Collecting the car was a pleasure and all paper work was carried out quickly and efficiently."
2018-10-01,5,"Very professional
Couldnt fault the service, all the staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcome. Provided a hire car and kept me informed of when my car was ready etc. would highly reccomend"
2018-10-01,4,Friendly staff who made the process easy.
2018-10-01,5,"I was very impressed with my experiences dealing with Cooper BMW Reading, all the cars were inside including the used stock. I arrived early for my appointment, I was able to wander round with complementary coffee, with no hassle. The salesman Mark Jeffery was very pleasant and helpful. I bought the car. The transaction was very straightforward. The car was delivered in due course, the delivery driver was very pleasant , the car was beautifully turned out and had a full tank of fuel. Very happy and certainly will go back when I get the next car."
2018-10-01,5,"Recently bought a Mini Cooper from Charlie at Banstead MINI. Charlie was very helpful and understanding of my requirements and helped me into my first brand new MINI, which I am absolutely thrilled with.Instead of having to wait 8 weeks for my perfect car to be made, he managed to find me one within two weeks! Thank you Charlie you were fab!"
2018-10-01,5,"Always a friendly welcome and first class service at this dealership.
They have looked after my Mini superbly. First class.
Would highly recommend."
2018-10-01,1,"Arrived at 9am was made to wait 20 minutes for someone to see me.

Got my car back to find a very poor attempt at a wash and vac , when you pay £209 for a service you may expect better

Not great"
2018-10-01,5,"Parking is a problem, but parking aside the service I received for a software update recall (including car cleaned inside and out) was excellent"
2018-10-01,5,"Really happy with my purchase, got a better deal than any other car supermarket with the reassurance of buying from a BMW main dealer."
2018-10-01,5,Great service the car was picked up at home being on a mobility scheme and delivered back fully serviced and clean inside and out
2018-10-01,5,"I was made welcome from the first call , I was kept updated and all promises were kept , the car was delivered on time , great service ."
2018-10-01,5,"Adam Harrod has gone above and beyond anything I've experienced before when purchasing a new car!
I first contacted him about booking a test drive in a new JCW and when arriving at the dealership I was simply handed the key, given a quick demo of how things work and allowing go off for a couple of hours no issues at all. This was very refreshing to be given a car with no pressure talk of money of deals before even setting foot on it.
After a day of him finding suitable cars and options we came to an agreement and delivery was just a week later. The car was even dropped off at my house to save me head over to collect (which was a great touch!)

The car was then dropped of by a very friendly and helpful member of their team giving me lots of time to go over the car (as this was the first time I'd seen the one I was getting) to check all is ok and ask any further questions.

Overall can't fault the dealership of members of staff I spoke to (a complete contract to a previous experience I'd had with the BMW side of the Coopers dealership a few years previous)

Very happy to recommend them to anyone.
Thanks again Adam (and all at Ipswich Mini)"
2018-10-01,5,"First class ,

No fuss and very professional,"
2018-10-01,5,A very pleasant experience. My 2nd visit within a month as my partner also purchased a car here.
2018-10-01,5,"Cooper BMW Teesside were absolutely fantastic in the purchase of my new car. Jak Bailes was the consummate professional in helping me with the purchase from the specification of the vehicle to purchase options. Sales Manager Ryan Trevelyan was also stand out in the service he provided, nothing was too much for the team.

By far the best customer experience I have had in many years of purchasing vehicles."
2018-10-01,5,Just had my car in for it's 2 year oil change and inspection and can't fault the level of customer service and pricing.

took 45 minutes to get car booked in.
and didn't answer the phone for over an hour.

hopeless."
2018-10-01,5,Ray was very helpful
2018-10-01,3,"Fairly good sales support but some lack of quick responses to my queries.
Slightly disappointed that there was absolutely no room to negotiate the price of the car as I was a cash buyer.
Also a little disappointed that you were not willing to included a couple of rubber floor mats with the car which most dealerships would not hesitate to do, however I am very happy with the car that I have purchased from you."
2018-10-01,5,"GREAT PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH, VERY HELPFUL THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BUYING EXPERIENCE."
2018-10-01,5,"Service Advisor Karen was very helpful in explaining what was happening at all times. She made sure I had the Volkswagen App and the connect which I did, and called to ask whether I wanted my front tyres changing. Smooth process from start to finnish. Recommended"
2018-10-01,5,"Possibly the slickest, smoothest, speediest sale in history … leading to the biggest birthday surprise! Fantastic service from Clare and her team at Tonbridge, who did everything possible to make the process easy and fun. We are so appreciative, love the new car and would highly recommend Mini at Tonbridge. Thank you!"
2018-10-01,2,"Really disappointed that I booked my car on for a service and a fault with the seat stiching and my car was returned with the seat stitching will outstanding and still waiting for a call from the dealer on what the plan is to fix it...

I also asked for support on Mercedes me app which was supposed to be delivered by the person picking up and dropping off my car but they did not know about and had no idea of how to help.."
2018-10-01,5,great customer service by the derby team
2018-10-01,5,"Good service, friendly."
2018-09-30,1,"Awful experience with receptionist to general manager. i had leased 4 brand new cars in the past 8 years through this branch, This time did not work out smoothly. The receptionist not very helpful at all. The new salesman Ajay Chohan was helpful. I was transferred to his general manager who had done the deal personally. The assistant manager Kerry who finished off the paperwork( gap insurance included) and took the deposit. I took Gap insurance and 3 other insurance products as well. I was assured all paid and the services requested included in the plan. The car was collected on 20/09./2018. I was again assured by the salesman and assistant manager on collection day and the car was collected. I've to pay a further refundable deposit of £500 for not having VC5 document. VC5 was handed at the branch on 25/09/2018.

On 27/09/2018 18:31 I had a call from Kerry asking for more money(Gap Insurance) and demanded that I have to pay immediately. Even though they owe me £500.00 (refundable) Technically I did not owe them any money according to my contract with them. How on the earth they left the car without payment.

When the deal was done, gap insurance was included in my monthly payment plan. Now they are saying, that gap insurance can't be included in the monthly payment plan. I needed the gap insurance for peace of mind that I paid the asking money again,, they did not even reduce the monthly payment.

I will not do business with them in the future. Be careful when you are dealing with these people. Especially on the collection day they will try to persuade you to buy more cover plans too.

I do not know the Mercedes Benz smoking policy at work, while the staff was showing the new car in their yard , and was smoking in front of my 13 year old child."
2018-09-30,5,"Excellent,honest and professional highly recommend coopers york"
2018-09-30,5,"Bought car from Mercedes Warrington, calum was very helpful and couldn’t do enough for me, when I picked car up, Calum made sure I knew everything I needed about the car as I had a long drive ahead of me, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Mercedes Warrington and especially Calum as he went out his to make it a first class experience for me."
2018-09-30,5,Fantastic range. Knowledgeable helpful staff. Nothing too much trouble.
2018-09-30,4,"Customer service was excellent, but the cost of a brake fluid change was somewhat steep."
2018-09-30,5,"When you buy a prestigious motor, you expect a prestigious service and as expected this was the case at inch cape Norwich, i would very much like to thank Sam for his tireless efforts to meet the demands of a testing client. Despite his junior status he was very professional and a credit to the company. Thank you."
2018-09-30,4,"Cars are not cheap and even when the service from the staff was great, it is very disappointing to collect your new car with no car mats."
2018-09-30,5,"Got the car we wanted, for the price we wanted. Communication was good and sales techniques were pleasant and not pushy."
2018-09-29,4,It's actually excellent customer service at Cooper BMW Ipswich. Once they finally react to my (many) requests to have my name correctly spelt on correspondence they can have the full five stars!
2018-09-29,4,"It was an A service only but all went well and completed in time stated. Showroom very clean as were the cars on show inside, the only down side to the visit was the lack of cups to have a drink of coffee ( had to use plastic cup as did several other customers at the time )."
2018-09-29,5,"Very easy to do business, friendly staff and excellent service."
2018-09-29,5,"Everything you expect from a main dealer, very personal and accommodating approach. Our insurance was due to expire so Inchcape lent us a vehicle for three days while our new one was prepared.

Excellent service"
2018-09-29,5,"Purchased a used Audi A6 Avant, the car was ready on time and fully valeted / serviced / MOT'd as agreed.
Very pleased with the car and the service and communication received from Stephen Barleycorn who was a pleasure to deal with at every stage of the sales process."
2018-09-29,1,"1. It took 20 minutes on the phone to make the appointment because the central booking system didn't work for Smarts. I was offered an appointment nearly 3 weeks ahead, which wasn't acceptable as my MoT expired in 10 days. I was then found an appointment the day after it expired.
2. When I turned up (at the appointed time) I was kept waiting for half an hour to hand over my keys and sign the form.
3. When I collected the car I was told that it had been washed and vacced, but it hadn't.
4. I was charged for screen wash though the reservoir was full when I dropped the car off."

2018-09-28,5,Great customer service from all staff during my initial enquiry to test drive to chosen vehicle purchase. Made my new car purchase feel extra special and the drive out of the showroom was an unexpected touch.
2018-09-28,1,"Single handedly ruined the last 4 years of my life.

Bought Range Rover sport. Worst mistake of my life. Almost up there with my first marriage.

Catastrophic engine failure 2 years out of warranty, and thought it was funny. No help whatsoever and I’ve even a letter stating that a vehicle at 5 years of age is beyond it’s life expectancy.

Now another 10 grand in debt for a new engine on a car that’s as reliable as an American space shuttle.

Avoid. Buy a German SUV instead."
2018-09-28,5,Very well run and efficient garage. Jess and Andrew were both excellent and provided a great service! I would definitely recommend to anybody. I’m extremely happy with my new car - thank you!!

2018-09-28,5,"Having done my homework on the cars I was interest in and visited each Manufacturer to make preliminary enquiries, I decided on a Mercedes Benz C 300 Cabriolet.
The person who lead me along this process was the same one all the way through. Her name is Hannah Wetherspoon. It's good to see and talk to the same person throughout the process. Always pleasant, smiling and professional.
I have to mention the ""REVEAL"" on seeing my car for the first time, brilliant and made us feel just that little bit special.
The showroom and all the staff we met were lovely."
2018-09-28,5,"All aspects of communication was excellent, from the initial booking in, from the collection of the car from my home and the return to my home. I was completely satisfied with the service that was carried out."
2018-09-28,5,"I received a prompt and professional service throughout my visit to the showroom/garage. I was informed of all likely costs, expected duration of stay, and how I might relax with drinks and access to a business area. I was very impressed with the communication skills of my contact person (Jack) who seemed very knowledgeable and kept me updated on the progress of my car repair. He is certainly a good ambassador for your business!"
2018-09-28,5,Good service experience. I was looked after and kept informed whilst my car was being serviced at Cooper Reading BMW.
2018-09-28,5,"Preston Inchcape.
A fantastic experience from start to finish a big Thank you to everyone involved there with my new car, everything from initial first enquiry to hand over was very well managed and the service was second to none.
A massive Thank you to sales executive Alan Wood who was just amazing, he found and had me in my new car within a couple of days an absolute star! To say I was impressed is well and truly an understatement.
Thanks again Alan and the team at Inchcape."
2018-09-28,3,Originally booked car in on a Saturday as was told by service people they could a diagnostic and gearbox upgrade only to find out after wasting a 25 min drive and a further 25 minute wait that they could not do this as their computers were down as it was weekend and all diagnostic work is done during the week only so further visit was needed this was finally sorted a week later but on both visits I was made to feel inferior due to only owning a 10 year old smart car and not a new Mercedes
2018-09-28,3,"Had car serviced: the service was quick, efficient and I only had to wait just over an hour. But unfortunately had to return the next day as engine had been overfilled and oil was all over engine bay and dripping on my relatively new tarmac drive. Not a happy man! Problem was sorted quickly and hopefully will not repeat. Just have to clean up the oil on my drive now."
2018-09-28,5,Excellent service . I trust Mini with my Car . Email always sent with picture of technical record .
2018-09-28,5,I found all the staff very friendly but particularly the salesman James Richardson who I dealt with the purchase of my new X3. James went out of his way to find the right car for me and took his time to explain the workings of all the technical stuff when I picked it up
2018-09-28,5,Excellent customer service
2018-09-28,5,"Collected my car,driver very polite and on time and delivered it back.serviced with video to show inspection.got vehicle back valeted.brilliant job and very pleased with service."

2018-09-28,5,All as expected. Kept updated and quick booking and turnaround.
2018-09-28,5,I was without a car as my car had been written off at the beginning of August . I had made several attempts to replace it without much success however going to Tonbridge Mini was a different experience. All the staff I met were helpful and attentive and I was able to get my car in the time that I wanted .
2018-09-28,4,"My contact Matt looked after me from start to finish, painless experience and love the car!"
2018-09-28,4,"Servicing side was fine, reception no offer of coffee on arrival or collection.

No big deal, but you ask for comments!"
2018-09-28,5,"As always a very pleasant and professional visit. Service and repairs undertaken without a problem, If it says Inchcape Toyota in the service book you know its been completed correctly"
2018-09-28,5,"I had a great experience when booking my car in with Lexus Derby, Holly Olivia and Joanne are a great asset to the Lexus brand and really show how customer service should be done.
The whole proccess was very quick, informative and completely hassle free.
After the proffesional service I recieved I wont be taking my vehicle to any other garage for the foreseeable future.
Keep up the great work."
2018-09-28,5,"Went into a mass panic when the service light came on knowing I needed the car to travel to the other end of the country and had little time to be without it. Rang Inchcape Bolton and spoke to Dan on reception and explained problem, no issue we arranged for me to drop car off the first thing in the morning and they would do the service while I waited if I wanted. Within minutes received confirmation e-mail upon arrival at the dealership was greeted by name as soon as I walked through the door, they clocked the registration as I drove in and had all the paperwork ready.
Left car with them and shortly afterward received a short video on the safety check being carried out on the vehicle shortly followed by a call from Dan saying car is ready for collection and then another text confirming same.
All I can say is Inchape Bolton did what was needed at extremely short notice with total professionalism and very friendly service and kept me informed throughout, five star service, easy to deal with and very friendly.
If that is typical then they have a loyal customer from now on because you simply can't get better service than what I received.
Thanks again guys and well done."
2018-09-27,5,"Just a really nice place to buy a car, all staff are great, friendly and knowledgeable. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone who is looking to buy a new car, especially the excellent Rob Share who has the patience of a saint!"
2018-09-27,5,"The Cobham branch was brilliant. Found what I wanted, fantastic service and after care and communication."
2018-09-27,5,"What a fantastic dealership.
Staff Jamie and Will were brilliant.
My partner bought me a brand new Mini Cooper with all the specs.
They planned a surprise for me as it was my dream from been a bairn to have a mini one day and my new hubby made it all happen with help from Will and Jamie.
They were very professional and and very helpful with my New hubby Jason.
Thanks Guys we will highly recomend you"
2018-09-27,5,"Following a traffic accident I was looking to replace my car and was not sure what type of car I was looking for . My husband and I visited Coopers Mini of Norwich , we looked around at the cars for sale and then went into the show room to ask for help. We were greeted by a very happy helpful receptionist who said she would get someone to help us, she also asked us if we would like a drink. Within a few minutes we were greeted by a very helpful man called Lee who showed us different models of cars and also arranged a test drive in a couple of them , he also took us out in a convertible model and showed us how the roof system works. After many questions that we asked him and nothing seemed too much trouble we decided that the customers service was fantastic and the patience that was shown he helped me find the car I wanted.
The great customer service continued when I picked up the car which Lee was very happy to show and explain how the media and sat nav systems worked.
I would recommend this company ."
2018-09-27,5,Quick and fast service. Friendly staff
2018-09-27,5,"Excellent service at Cooper York. Friendly and very professional. We’ve travelled the one hour twenty minute trip to buy Minis from Cooper York for around 20 years. There is a BMW/Mini dealership in Teesside (20 minutes away from us) but the level of service, particularly BMW side is very poor compared to Cooper York."
2018-09-27,5,Excellent as usual. The sales executive Mr Mark Beamson was excellent and very helpful when we decided to buy a GLC. Thank you 5*
2018-09-27,5,Many thanks to Alan Wood of Inchcape Landrover Preston. Absolutely fantastic service from first stepping foot in the branch to collecting my car. Alan did everything to ensure it all ran smoothly and would not hesitate to recommend or use again. Thank you Alan.
2018-09-27,4,"Good customer service and car ready when expected.
Glad I had service plan because the cost of service is extortionate."
2018-09-27,5,"Many thanks to Samuel Pullin for the way he conducts himself as a Jaguar representative.
From the time we set foot in the Jaguar show room to the time we left with one of his beautiful cars he was professional in every way.
He was young and enthusiastic which I did not expect to find in a Jaguar showroom.
I’ve never brought a car from a Jaguar dealer before and had a very rigid idea of what I would expect.
And in Samuel we received the exact opposite. A breath of fresh air.
Also a big thank you to his manager Nathan who also conducted himself in the best possible way
They always rang when they said they were going to ring and always emailed to let us know exactly what was going on which in my experience is very rare.
Excellent experience from start to finish and I look forward to buying my next car from them in the future"
2018-09-27,5,The whole experience at Inchcape was very pleasant. Adam the salesman was really nice to deal with and knew the product really well. The environment was friendly and helpful. I would recommend Inchcape to anybody.
2018-09-27,5,"We took our 9 year old Mini Cooper for its MOT yesterday (26 September). We go back to the same garage where we bought the car, every year for MOT and servicing. They were able to fit us in at short notice and fixed a few defects which we didn’t know about in order for the car to pass its MOT. They were polite, welcoming and professional and we would not hesitate to recommend them.

2018-09-27,2,"Queue to drop off car, no aplogy given for the delay, seemed a lot of staff walking around but no enough on the service desks.

Felt that the staff couldn’t care less if they had your business or not.

Car was not given a valet as promised, advised cleaning staff had walked out on loss of contract, but only when I asked why the car had not been cleaned.

Offers I could bring it in later for a valet, but given how long it took to drop car off for service, not a likely option.

Disappointed but not surprised after reading other reviews."
2018-09-27,3,No issues with the work or the technical staff but trying to contact the branch is pretty much impossible. Still waiting for a call back promised by the call centre in Norfolk (yes Norfolk!) for a quote or work or a response to an email. Whilst I was in the branch another customer actually drove to complain in person as he had given trying to contact them by phone.
2018-09-27,1,"I had my car serviced yesterday by Mercedes in Derby (Inchcape UK). I booked to stay in their lounge area, while my car was serviced. When I arrived I found their coffee machine was out of order and the information they had on my car was incorrect. In its self neither worthy of a complaint. What I did find appalling was the way two other separate customers were dealt with while I was there. One had booked for an MOT only to be told he hadn't in a very rude manner (in fact he had and it was their error). The second came to pick up a car. Same very rude manner by another employee, saying it was the customers fault (again it was found to be Mercedes fault as the car was found 20 minutes later. My service went without any hitch but the valet clean was very very poor."
2018-09-27,5,"Seamless experience very efficient start to finish

Thank you"
2018-09-27,5,"Helpful assistant, great service am v grateful"
2018-09-27,5,Excellent staff - communication and service- probably the best I have encountered
2018-09-27,5,"A first class customer experience on all levels, super happy with the service and also quality of the X4, it was spotless on collection and performs perfectly, a first class service indeed.. cheers BMW of Malton."
2018-09-27,5,Top job - I can recommmend Andy Plant who looked after the whole purchase professionally.
2018-09-27,5,"I spotted a Range Rover SVR on Autotrader which I fancied - there were many advertised - and contacted the dealer which happened to be Inchcape in Preston. I am not sure that the first sales person took me seriously and did not respond to an email. I am impatient so I rang up and was connected with Alan Wood in sales who was easy to deal with, clear in his communication and eager to assist me. I have bought in excess of 30 new and second hand cars in the last 20 years and am overly familiar with the dealership sales process so I usually cut to the chase! Alan was great to deal with, he picked me up from the station and was proud of the new site Inchape have developed (rightly so, its vast). So in summary....I liked the dealership facilities but more so I liked the excellent service that Alan provided me with. If I had a business in the north rather than London I would hire him!!"
2018-09-27,5,"Once you can find somewhere to park, the service was excellent."
2018-09-27,5,Great experience witch cooper Bmw in Chelmsford. Ian Beddis was great in sourcing me a car which wasn’t easy. Emma was very helpful alongside Craig in sorting out the finance side and the whole thing went very smoothly. I was impressed that they gave me both a good deal on my old car and the new one. Handover was excellent and very explanatory. I have used cooper before and they always make you feel welcome and treat you with professionalism and respect. great people to deal with!
2018-09-27,1,"An absolute shambles. Just called on my way to pick up my car for the second promised time and have been told it's not yet gone in the workshop but no one thought to let me know.. Have now failed to service my vehicle for 2 consecutive days although they have had the vehicle on site for both of those days. Completely ruined my work timetable for both of those days and have had to cancel appointments. They makes promises they don't keep and even worse fail to inform you of the delays and broken promises.
Avoid at all costs, they are a disgrace."
2018-09-27,5,"I have to start by saying that this sunderland BMW dealership is the best I have ever dealt with in my 40+ years of buying cars, the staff, facilities and the want to help is second to non, The one thing that stood out head and shoulders was the Sales executive Lee Freeman, he genuinely could not have done more, took time to find us the perfect car for our needs, test drives, demonstrations was no hassle at all, he treated us like we were the only people in the world and made the whole 5 star Experiance extra special, we can not thank him and the manager Gregg Cathrae enough for all they did, I think Inchcape/Cooper need this sales exec promoted to management level as if not another company will snap him up as he made the whole car buying experiance as good as it was.

We love our new BMW and it just completes the perfect customer package

Once again thanks and I recommend to anyone looking for a car to ask for Lee Freeman."
2018-09-27,3,"booked service online and got a confirmation email ..
when arriving at mercedes they did not have any details of my booked service ... i had to show them proof of my confirmation details and booking time .. not very happy at the system they use online ... and the time it took was 50% longer than mercedes times .. 1.5hrs instead of 1 hr ...
i waited for car as i had another appointment ( and was late ).."
2018-09-27,5,"I purchased a Landrover Discovery 5 from Inchcape Preston and was looked after extremely well by Alan Wood. He was friendly, personable and sorted any queries that I had. I would recommend him and would be happy to deal with the garage again."
2018-09-27,5,"Very attentive service from the moment we walked into the showroom from Andrew Haynes. Andrew explained the cars pros and cons to us very thoroughly and provided a very detailed handover of the vehicle upon collection.

Would not hesitate is using or recommending Inchcape, Chester."
2018-09-27,5,"Recently purchased a demonstrator Jaguar F Pace from Alan Wood at Inchcape Preston.
His attitude and service were excellent and any minor hicchups were sorted without delay. I would be more than happy to deal with him again."
2018-09-27,5,"Excellant service car picked up on time and returned early as requested,and it had been washed result"
2018-09-27,5,"Had a great experience with cooper Teesside, they picked my X3 up and delivered it after a service and MOT the health check video showed a nail in the rear run flat Pirelli tyre which was very observant as they replaced both rear tyres at a great price, everyone I spoke to were very polite and helpful."
2018-09-27,5,"The sales person was very informative and polite, and in no way pushy."
2018-09-27,5,"Excellent! I would recommend to anyone!
Friendly staff, I've had a nice courtesy car and my car was done in time. Thank you!"
2018-09-27,5,"Buying a car is difficult. Why would you choose one brand over another? The quality of the product of course, but the care and attention shown by the sales team makes the difference. I cannot fault the product and I cannot fault the sales team, or rather the salesman. He treated us as friends and took every care to ensure we were happy with the decision which we made (i.e.) there was no pressure to make that spdecision."
2018-09-27,2,Upon arrival I was greated by lovely lady who made me feel welcome. The dropping of part of experience was okay. I asked for a courtesy car which I did received for the day which also came with rotting apple pieces in the back footwell. ( disgusting) It was when I picked the car up it went abit south. When pulling on to the car park to pick my car I noticed my bonnet was not shut all the way which could of bin dangerous if I was getting on the motorway at high speeds. I asked the mechanic and he didn’t have a answer. I then received my service book along with my copy of my receipt where I had a look over the two. In the service book Some boxes hadn’t been ticked off to say if the work had been carried out or not and one of the box’s What should have been ticked yes haddent. Very sloppy if you ask me!!! When in the car I expected to get in to a clean car as the lady on the phone stated they give you a complimentary velvet. It was so dusty and not clean to a velvet standard you would expect from VW. I did ask the mechanic why it wasn’t all clean and his response was... every customer only gets the outside wash and the carpets hoovered ( very poor)
2018-09-27,5,Very knowledgeable and helpful sales and finance staff. Available alternatives readily presented and speedy action to meet requirements.
2018-09-26,5,"Have recently dealt with Calum at Inchcape Warrington where I purchased a used GLE . He was professional & communicative throughout and made the whole experience easy for myself and my my wife . Would recommend without question
Mr Vernon - Warrington"
2018-09-26,5,Helpful and professional staff with vehicles well presented.
2018-09-26,5,"Great buying experience all the way... leadtime to receive car was longer than originally quoted but professionalism, communication, attentiveness, polite and pleasant to deal with all excellent!"
2018-09-26,5,"Dropped my car off for a service and mot.
Very smooth, staff were welcoming and professional.
Later in the day I received a video going through the progress of what was happening with the car.
Picked my car up later in the day, again very smooth quick procedure. Karl went through everything for me, even backed my car out for me ready for me to drive away, which was greatly appreciated. Also my car was valeted which was lovely.
Would definitely use this dealership again."
2018-09-26,4,"My car had to go in to the VW garage in Oldham due to a fault that had already happened when i bought it (unbeknown to myself). I dealt with John from the workshop and he was absolutely brilliant, sincere and honest. However, there was a few issues with the car sales team around payments and who should be responsible to pay for this. John was able to offer me reassurance and the service he provided was great, he was able to fix my car and the payment issue was resolved. It’s unfortunate that this is only 4* if I was rating my experience with John alone this would definitely be a 5* review. Thanks for all of your help ☺️ Hannah"
2018-09-26,5,First class service as ever from Cooper Reading showing you get what you pay for. Friendly service with good communication.
2018-09-26,5,I just purchased a new Polo and was very satisfied with the service I received.
2018-09-26,5,"I called in to the Preston dealership to test drive ‘on spec’ a Range Rover Sport and my first point of contact was Alan Wood. Despite not making an appointment and the showroom being busy Alan arranged the test drive that day.

From that point onwards Alan Wood has handled everything, keeping me regularly informed, working to my timescale to get the car ready for delivery. On inspection of the car, there were a number of items that needed attention and I trusted Alan and the dealership to attend to these.

Last Saturday I arrived at the dealership to find an immaculately presented vehicle that far exceeded my expectation. The handover took about 90 minutes and, in that time, every aspect of the car and the controls were explained to me.

In over 30 years of buying nearly new to one-year old cars my most recent buying experience has been the best. I have never interacted with a car salesman who has been more professional, dedicated and committed to making sure I was a satisfied customer; it’s been an exceptional buying experience."
2018-09-26,3,Instead of trying to suck up to your clients with have a seat sir or have a coffee Sir. Try and just be polite and efficient some of us are very busy people!
2018-09-26,5,"Went in to view a car for a friend! Ending up chatting with grant and talking to see what deal he could do for me.

We sat down! Looked at the car and a deal was done! Grant is an asset to inchcape and a great sales guy!

Cheers"
2018-09-26,1,"Failed to seek authorisation from leasing company without prompting. Did not return phone calls and service manager, to date, has failed to reply to my complaint email."
2018-09-26,5,very helpful video - car returned washed and valeted - a small complaint was the time taken to see a service rep both on dropping the car off and picking it up
2018-09-26,5,Excellent customer service. Kirsty was brilliant and made the whole process of buying a new car run smoothly.
2018-09-26,5,"Very thorough and called directly when the car had finished the service. When I had to collect the car it was so simple, literally I was given my keys and I went on my way. Recommend it to everyone. I wouldn’t of expected less from BMW."
2018-09-26,5,"We dealt with Hue Evans from the very beginning and we were so pleased with his service. He guided us in whatever we needed advice. Basically, our all experience with Mercedes has been full filling.And we are pleased to have finally gotten the car we want. Thank you."
2018-09-26,5,"Usual Great Service

I have come to expect great levels of service and they didn't disappoint this time.
Nice to be able to sit back and have a coffee as well."
2018-09-26,4,"The service I received at the showroom was 5 star, I have deducted one star because I booked the test drive online through the Mercedes site but when I turned up they had no knowledge of the arrangement??? I do not know who's fault this was but they could not have been more apologetic and my overall experience was excellent, particularly Carwyn Edwards who dealt with my purchase in a manner I was very comfortable with. He was not at all 'pushy' and I felt he wanted to make sure the car was suitable for my needs.

I would certainly recommend anyone to this showroom."
2018-09-26,5,Great Service and very helpful sales staff. Emma is a credit to the sales team.
2018-09-26,1,"Swindon Audi

Terrible customer care. Service work not done properly. Shocking attitude.

Go elsewhere."
2018-09-26,5,Excellent help from Henry and brilliant service. Good to get a video fro VW to show the condition of the car
2018-09-26,5,"Diane on the booking/reception team is excellent, her customer service is exemplary."
2018-09-26,5,"Service was great, Ash was extremely helpful and friendly."
2018-09-26,4,other than quite a long wait on both my initial ordering visit and my new car collection I could not fault the process and in particular the reception staff for their hospitality .
2018-09-26,5,"Anyone thinking of buying a new Mercedes Benz should seriously consider visiting their new car sales department based at Pride Park, Derby.
The first people you meet are the friendly and efficient reception staff. They are courteous and polite and offer immediate refreshments in the form of warm beverages.
An open invitation is extended to look around the show room with access to a varied array of Mercedes cars and vans but also the Smart range.
The receptionist then offers you the chance to consult with a sales executive. There is no pressure here just a friendly request.
I was joined by a sales executive named Damien Howell and his demeanour was one of friendliness and helpfulness.
He questioned me about my requirements and made suggestions based on my needs.
It felt like he was genuinely interested in me and my requirements and after arranging a test drive in two different models I made the decision to purchase a new GLA.
This was ordered but not in the UK so was shipped from Germany.
I was kept informed at all stages on shipping and collected my car a few weeks later where the excellent customer service provided by Damien continued. He spent time and effort on making the collection special and informative and I left the showroom very pleased with my purchase and experience.
I enjoyed dealing with Mercedes Benz Derby and would recommend them if your on the market for a new car."
2018-09-26,3,"The service was very professional. However, I was told when I booked the car in, over the phone, that Mercedes Me would be fitted to the car free of charge. It doesn’t appear to have been done. Can somebody explain why? It took a considerable effort to drop my car off and pick it up again. Thanks"
2018-09-26,5,"Always a great experience dealing with Cooper Chelmsford. Friendly and efficient, their pragmatic approach to customer service sets them apart from their competitors. 10/10"

2018-09-26,5,"Excellent service, very polite and efficient. Car collection was a great asset
Would recommend to anyone."
2018-09-26,5,Recently bought a car from the Mercedes garage in Warrington. Calum Dunbar was really great and professional at his job and we couldn't have been happier. We felt at ease while looking at the various cars and not pushed into anything. He went out of his way to ensure that we had a good deal and went over and beyond what we were expecting.
2018-09-26,5,Excellent customer service from beginning to end. Wish there was not so much emphasis on selling add on insurance cover for things but not a problem.
2018-09-26,1,"This feedback is meant to be constructive. The level of customer service has been very poor. A lot of people looking like they really couldn't be bothered to help me.

The whole process for getting the repairs on my car done (totalling over £1k) took a lot longer than necessary but I can accept that. What was unacceptable was having to wait for over an hour to be seen to when I came to collect my car, whilst others came in after me and were on their way before me (even though my interaction was only to make a payment). The car was not cleaned upon return. There was an engine warning light still present in the car that was not highlighted and took a lot of persuasion before finally it was re-looked at without charge (I had already paid for a diagnostics check). Was also given incorrect information about the cost of a replacement key and when I came back in with the correct documentation I was told it was a higher price and the guy looked at me like I'm an idiot for saying I was quoted a lower price. More time wasted for me. Will avoid using this place again until the CS is improved)."
2018-09-26,5,"My wife’s Mini has only covered 16k despite being 10 years old. Full history with Mini. Warning light on the dash for the engine inn monday. Called Mini at Croydon, booked car in the following day. Health check carried out and the warning light had vanished. No problems detected. No charge levied. Excellent service from Diane Lund who clearly knows how to build relationships based on trust."

2018-09-26,5,"Very helpful service. Everything was explained clearly. WIth so many options when buying a new car, it can be quite daunting! Constructive & helpful advice & tips were also offered all the way through the choosing of my new car. this made it a pleasurable experience"
2018-09-25,5,Excellent service from making the booking to receiving my valeted car back on time
2018-09-25,5,Very satisfied with service we experienced at Cooper York 24/09/18
2018-09-25,5,"Ben was friendly, professional and delivered excellent communication from start to finish. First class service. Many thanks."
2018-09-25,3,"Young salesman was fairly decent at his job and a nice guy overall - but still has plenty to learn though.

Preparation of a number of cars to view on the system as opposed to waiting for long periods of time between the dealer sourcing numerous codes independently each time - took over four hours from arriving to selecting a car shown to us on the system and we only viewed three.

Interpersonal skills could do with a touch up - rolling your eyes at a customer is quite funny in private but probably not whilst talking to their partner in front of them.

Simple point - emails to customer was really really casual - probably didn't know any better though and might potentially require training to enhance levels of professionalism.

Could also do with developing a depth of knowledge on some of the cars the salesman was expecting to sell - there was a few times where subject matter lacked depth or clarify."
2018-09-25,5,"Good experience at Cooper Malton when buying a new BMW. Impressed with the whole service and ease of transaction, with the well informed sales executive making me feel at ease. Good updates provided all the way through the process and impressed with responsiveness. I have bought two cars from this branch now and would trust and recommend their business."
2018-09-25,5,"A very pleasant experience ,arrived without an appointment and was made to feel welcome from the outset, we looked at cars in well presented showroom and a salesman appeared and led us through all purchase options found a car that was exactly the one we were after. The process of purchasing was easy and every aspect of the deal was explained fully . When the handover day arrived the salesperson (Adam) sat with us and went through all controls from Media to Bluetooth ,navigation and all relevant safety and economy settings. Very impressed."
2018-09-25,5,"Nick Hawkins at the Norwich Sales branch looked after me and my wife very well and rate his service exceptional.
Thank you very much in getting us the correct deal to suit our financial budget and we are now enjoying our lovely new car .
I will look forward again when we decide to upgrade our car again in a couple of years time.
Kind regards

2018-09-25,5,Great experience Callum on sales very helpful
2018-09-25,3,"I rate Bens service 5 stars but unfortunately the valet team let him down. The car did not have a full valet/hoover/clean. Only the front mats were hoovered and on further inspection the windscreen had finger prints all over it, back seats/mats/boot not hoovered. This is disappointing and not the first time that the valet has let audi maidstone down. Ben did offer to send the car back in whilst I waited but I did not want to wait any longer with two children in tow.
Coincidently - last time I picked my car up it ‘valet’ was written down on the summary and promised to me but it had not been hoovered or cleaned and although the sales member offered to drive it back around I did not want to stay any longer and left.
I would like a complimentary valet offered if I could bring it in and wait.
As mentioned - Bens service was second to none but unfortunately as a package I rate 3 stars due to the disappointing valet."
2018-09-25,4,"Everything was good except when they cleaned the car, just a rinse, wheels not cleaned, they told me I had curbed the front wheel, when I got home I cleaned it and the mark that they said was a curb, came off with polish, the wheel was not damaged at all, just a mucky wheel."
2018-09-25,5,"Buying a MINI was as easy as any such purchase can get. I had demo rides in two different models, made the decision and was walked through the options available. The price was attractive and the part exchange was surprisingly reasonable. The car was ordered and arrived ahead of schedule and collection was almost immediate. I dealt with and thoroughly recommend Abbie Tamsett at Cooper Colchester Mini"
2018-09-25,5,"Helpful and friendly service.
Nice to deal with a car salesman who wasn't ""pushy"". Very knowledgeable.

Friendly driver who delivered my new Mini and collected my old car."

2018-09-25,5,We were treated with every consideration at all times. Nothing was too much trouble.
2018-09-25,5,"It was a great experience, I had my passenger side air bag changed for free.
The service was excellent, and the follow up was great, I would recommend any one the inch cap service centre in Basingstoke.
All the best to the team."
2018-09-25,2,"Used this dealer for several years and always hope that this years experience will be better than the last. Alas it just gets worse.
Little or no effective communication between service advisor and customer together with service phones not answered after 5.30 and a distinct lack of staff who know what’s going on. When one is paying hundreds of pounds for the experience you have to wonder as to why
you bother."

2018-09-25,5,We were more than happy with the service we received when recently buying a new car from Inchcape in Guildford. Martyn Harvey dealt with us in a patient and knowledgeable way and we would not hesitate to contact him again in the future.

2018-09-25,5,"We always get very good service from Cooper Colchester - we have now owned our Mini for six years, and Chris and Amy have looked after us very well!

Many thanks from two ""Oldies!"""
2018-09-25,4,The car did not arrive back until 17:15 and whilst this is within the timelines given it would have been useful to be given an estimate earlier in the day as I finished work at 16:30.
2018-09-25,5,"Outstanding level of service by all the team, from the call handler to the service gentleman and Carl who dealt with me in store. They kept me updated with progress sent me videos of my car to inform me and provided me with a comfy like for like courtesy car! I would highly recommend purchasing and using AUDI in the future."

I would comment that I find some of your paperwork difficult to understand, confusing"
2018-09-25,1,"If you value customer care, honesty and reliability- don’t use Inchcape VW Twickenham.

Paid £300+ for a service and they returned my car having not completed the service tasks and then expected me to come back on my own time and further cost.

Colin the manager admitted the fault was on their part but was less than interested in doing anything about it."
2018-09-25,5,"Excellent customer service from Phil and Tom .
Many thanks

Terry Walker"
2018-09-25,5,"Excellent customer service. great from start to finish. My car service was completed in very little time, it was all very efficient."
2018-09-25,5,Efficient & reliable service provided
2018-09-25,4,"First time at this dealership-overall impression very good.
I knew that I would wait in the lounge area but was told that the job would take ""about half an hour"". It didn't. It took over an hour. I don't mind but I would prefer to be told ""about an hour"" and if it is shorter, well done them.
However, they have a more down to earth manner which I prefer.
Definitely use them again."
2018-09-25,5,I was told that the work would take two hours. I returned exactly two hours later and as I entered the show room I received a phone call stating the car was ready for collection. Excellent work.
2018-09-25,5,"Fantastic experience, Graham Dean was great from start to finish. Regular updates and a video of the car when on the ramp. This was my second time at Colchester VW and both times the level of service has been great. Keep up the great work."
2018-09-25,5,"Fabulous customer service, extremely knowledgeable, nothing was too much trouble. They made collecting my new car a wonderful experience. Definitely recommend"
2018-09-25,5,"Very polite and efficient staff. All in, a pleasant experience."
2018-09-25,5,Brilliant service covered everything answered all my questions and concerns Grant was a very good sales advisor
2018-09-25,5,"Fantastic experience. We had a choice of 4 SUVs and based on our experience with Inchcape and Martyn, we chose to buy from Jaguar"
2018-09-25,5,Thank you for a really good service. Would recommend to family and friends.
2018-09-24,5,Great service and a very clean car! Reception desk was excellent too - efficient & friendly.
2018-09-24,5,"This is the third Mercedes we have purchased from Inchcape UK Leicester. We find all the staff professional but friendly, helpful and efficient. We have always found that they listen to what you are looking for in your choice of vehicle; ensuring that you test drive the vehicle and talk through what the vehicle has to offer. All the staff make it such a pleasurable experience taking the time to explain not only features of the vehicle also what is the best option for purchasing the vehicle. The service continues; we have always received follow up phone calls to make sure we are happy with our purchase and if there is anything we to know. The service department are equally as professional and attentive and always seem to make the extra effort to ensure customer satisfaction. We cannot recommend Mercedes Inchcape Leicester more highly."
2018-09-24,5,"Great deal, great service and 1st class customer care"
2018-09-24,5,Excellent Service.
2018-09-24,5,"This review relates to help given by Scott Matthews from Inchcape VW Telford. His help in getting a hoist fitted to the car being purchased and co-ordinating all the arrangements, particularly when my wife is disabled and we don't live locally, was exceptional.
Also thanks go to David Pacey, Sales Manager, who particularly helped to resolve a problem with VAT Relief on the adapted vehicle, which required
a total focus on the customer rather than company policy."
2018-09-24,5,"As I am retired, sitting in the lounge for a couple of hours reading is no big deal so this is my preferred way of having a service. All went well with very little interchange necessary between me an the agent. Since the car has only done 4600 miles in its first year I would have been very surprised at a different outcome."
2018-09-24,5,"Great customer service, Mohammed was extremely helpful and accommodating around arranging for the early collection of my car from a service because I had commitments due to it being my birthday. Then, when I had to change plans at short notice he was ever so helpful to rearrange things and allow for a weekend collection instead. There was never a complaint or hint of frustration on his part, and I do appreciate his flexibility and Volkswagen’s support to prioritise my service. Thank you, I’ll definitely be back."
2018-09-24,5,From start to finish we were kept informed by Aysha and when she left her position (4 days before we picked up our new car) she handed over our care to Andy who was just as helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you so much
2018-09-24,4,Tony Kelly was the sales person at Inchcape (Warrington) Mercedes who looked after us when we chose to buy a C200 SE Sport. He was able to locate and source a new vehicle within 7 days. Tony did a very good handover explaining the features of the new car. He also handled the finance and paperwork aspects in a timely and professional manner. A very good and enjoyable overall experience.
2018-09-24,5,The Salesman Ray Davey was very professional and a pleasure to do business with and a credit to the jaguar company.
2018-09-24,4,"recent Audi service (first time) Maidstone Audi

after some confusion around the service due to this being a company car and some debate around service requirements from chap at the desk which went right over my head as I just book it in over the phone. after talking to him he was a nice guy and helped me out with what I needed some oil (not sure about £17 for 2 litres but I'm sure it was imported from Germany and precision engineered!) I was also greeted by a very nice lady at reception and offered a coffee so overall experience was good and when I do require a full service in a few months I hope there will be a little less faffing about between Audi and the company lease company and I can just get it sorted relatively quickly"
2018-09-24,4,"Well organised, good coordination and did the job."
2018-09-24,1,Had to wait ages before anyone was available to take my keys. One person on the service side on a Saturday! Not their fault as it was very busy. Had car for 4 hours for service and MOT but didnt get time to clean car.
2018-09-24,5,"Bought a new Mini last week. All the staff at York were lovely, no pressure or hard sell. Alex was really helpful and I’d definitely recommend the branch"
2018-09-24,3,"My car was in for a manufacturer recall on the steering wheel airbag. I was tole the work would take an hour so arranged to wait while the work was carried out. the car finished do on the hour, my keys were handed back to me in a crowded waiting lounge by a young chap who proceeded to say for all to hear they had carried out a health check on the car and the front wiper blade ware indicator was showing they needed replacing and the cost , then said but they are working fine. Next up the off-side drivers tyre is showing ware to the outside and inside edge, the tyre still has legal tread but needs to be replaced and the wheel alignment checked. All the other tyres are ok. The cost £350. I checked the tyre later to find it was under inflated, something I thought they would have picked up on and most lightly the cause of the ware to the outside edges.
I can’t say I’m dissatisfied with the recall work just not happy with the way the unrequested work was presented to me in such a public manor."
2018-09-24,5,"Having had a bad experience with Vines I chose Cooper Cobham.
Initially I spoke to Connor who got Emma Faluso to call me back to do an order over the phone.
I told Emma the details of the spec and the figures I was working with she was able to do everything I asked of her she would phone when she said she was professional and did everything in her power to get me my mini earlier than the scheduled date .
When collecting the car I dealt with Paul Garner the sales manager and Connor a sales consultant. There was nothing else they could’ve done to make my visit to them and collection of my car easier.
I haven’t driven for 17 months so Connor kindly took me out in my car and made sure I was happy with it . another finishing touch when I arrived at the showroom my car had a poster in the window stating it was waiting my collection that was the icing on the cake . I know now that I will not go anywhere else other than Cooper Cobham and would recommend them to anybody . once again thank you Emma Paul and Connor for everything you did ."
2018-09-24,4,Inchscape Guildford were very helpful and a friendly team. Who took time to explain about the car we wanted and how it all works.
2018-09-24,5,Very good service friendly and helpful
2018-09-24,5,The whole process was dealt with professionally and efficiently
2018-09-24,5,Great service as always
2018-09-24,5,Great service
2018-09-24,5,"All went very well during our new car purchase negotiations, pleasant people to deal with, all queries answered, a useful test drive, a good price agreed, finally the car delivered on time and in absolutely tip-top condition. Very pleased with all aspects of the car. Thoroughly recommended !"
2018-09-24,1,"Mercedes Nottingham shameful dealer, damaged car they knew about and then denied.
I don’t know where to start they are so bad.
I saw an SLC advertised, looked good, everything I wanted, even 1 owner! There is the first lie. It was, I subsequently found out, an ex-rental. I even asked when viewing it and was told it was a “management car from Milton Keynes”!
It drove ok so I decided to buy it.
3 weeks later I took it to my local Mercedes garage (Harrogate) to have the Satnav updated. They informed me that it had substantial damage under the front of the car.
Indeed it had: Broken splitter and a significant amount of scraping under the front skirt.
I asked Mercedes Nottingham about this and their immediate reply (with an accompanying very low res picture of the car) was that it was Mercedes Harrogate’s fault.
They said that they could provide “our VHC from our workshop”. When I asked for this they sent only the written report which reported no damage to the vehicle. As it turns out this was a work of fiction. It did however refer to an “nsf wheel slightly buckled”. Which got me thinking along with brand new tyres on the front (after only 10000 miles!) what has happened to this car.
They said that they had no more pictures or reports to show me and continued to blame Harrogate Mercedes. They failed to explain why the car had 2 new front tyres when the original rears still had life in them saying that “they must have worn out first!”
I had downloaded the original Auto trader pictures of the car and upon closer inspection it showed the front splitter to be broken already when they advertised the car!!
I sent them the original pictures from their advert and they eventually agreed that they were wrong and it was damaged before I bought it.
To cut a long story short they offered to repair it in Nottingham. After their less than convincing display of expertise and integrity I elected for full refund. This car had obviously been heavily curbed at some point with significant damage to the underside. I can’t believe their claim that they did not spot this on a ramp when carrying out Mercedes’s “meticulous checks”. I would expect much more from an Approved dealer.
Update.
This car as of 19/09/2018 is back on sale at the same dealer with the same damage!!!"
2018-09-24,3,"Knowing I wanted to buy an Audi A1, I went to my local Audi garage (Inchcape Macclesfield) and requested a test drive. After nearly a month of being passed from one rep to the next; cancelled bookings, or just simply being forgotten about, I was arranged a test drive with David Done.
David was easily the best part of a shoddy experience. Straightforward and to the point, he gave me a great deal on a high spec A1."
2018-09-24,2,"Despite my husband's work colleagues, my colleagues at the NHS and our family's advice not to go to Mercedes-Benz Nottingham because of their very poor customer service and bad after sale care we decided to go to the branch for the convenience. Sadly, that was by far the worst experience that my husband and I have ever had buying any car. My family came to the Mercedes-Benz Nottingham on the 08/08/18 and immediately spotted an A Class which we immediately paid a deposit to secure it and take if off the market for the next 7 days which Pete Ward (a very lovely sale assistant) advised us to do. As we had other engagement that day, we had no opportunity further assess the vehicle or even take it out for a drive. Nevertheless, Pete booked a test drive for us for the next day 09/08/18 and advised his colleague (Lee) will look after us. On arrival on the Sunday afternoon with our 1 year daughter, we had to wait almost another 20 minutes before we were eventually seen by Lee. On meeting Lee, it felt like it was an immediate judgement on our character (so why are we here? Why do we want to test drive the vehicle? Are we paying for the vehicle today? How are we intending to pay for it?) and all these questions were raised even before test driving the car. My husband was already agitated because of the long wait with our baby and he also felt we were being interrogated, and being put under tremendous pressure to make a decision that afternoon or leave the showroom as he had serious potential customers waiting for the same car. we only came to test drive drive the car before we made our decision the following week as arranged with Pete Ward. Besides, the vehicle he claimed these customers saw online seemed false because as we were informed that immediately the deposit was paid, the vehicle would be taken off the market and online for the next 7 days. It took us almost an hour to eventually test drive the car. Lee took away the excitement we initial had when Pete attended to us however, Nathan ( the sales manager) partially restored our confidence again when he came to speak to us after the test drive and on the day of the purchase as my husband is also looking to purchase his car for his 40th. We informed Nathan we are looking to buy the vehicle but we will make the decision as we agreed with Pete Ward and will only conclude the sale with Pete as we wanted no further dealings with Lee. We also encountered another shocking dissatisfaction after the vehicle was bought and given the 7 days complimentary insurance was given. We shopped around and found a quote cheaper than what the mercedes insurance had offered which also covered everything Mercedes had offered. I called to ask Mercedes insurance to match our quote if they could. The gentleman advised he was unable to match it and I informed him I couldn't justify why I should pay an extra over £700 to their insurance which the gentleman couldn't justify also also other than advise me that we will get the best service if I went with them. I politely declined their offer and informed the gentleman I will pursue my cheaper quote instead. I thanked him for his time but just before I hung up as he must have thought I had hung up the phone already I overheard him telling his colleagues ""what a waste of time"" before he finally hung up. I immediately called back and asked to speak to his manager but spoke to Dexter who apologised on his behalf and offered to extend the 7 days complimentary insurance by another 7 days whilst they investigated the complaint further. I have not had the best experience for buying a vehicle from the branch and now this hence, my hesitation to buy a service plan with the branch. I feel this will only continue. I was driving a Volvo V40 as a company car but decided to get a personal car with Mercedes as I thought Mercedes will only match or supersede Volvo's customer service because of what the brand stands for but never in my life have I been treated with such back to back contempt in my life."
2018-09-24,4,"Everything associated with my service was great; but I was not too impressed with the post service clean, the exterior clean was very good but the interior clean was as if it had been rushed and there was still a lot of mess inside the car."
2018-09-23,1,"I was no impressed at all with the service I received. I went in Cooper Bmw reading having received a letter of a recall from bmw regarding a smell of smoke from my AC. It took a week to get car back but lucky enough Bmw offered me a hired car. When I received my car the engineer didn’t tell me they did nothing to the car or they were missing some parts he just told me my car was ready.
Just after one day on a very sunny day I tried to use my AC to cool down the temperatures when am driving, to my surprise the AC were not working anymore. I called cooper reading and one lady tried to check for my record she couldn’t see have any trace of my car being given to me back. She asked me if I filled in any paperwork before taking the car I told her no. She had to dig deep and found out that they had parts to install in may car but out of stock at the time they had my car all this was news to me.
I was given another appointment to fix the problem, I met with another engineer who asked me what happened. On explaining myself as the story above he didn’t wait for me to finish and used words which knocked my confidence. He said “Ok I am not saying I dnt believe you” . In my understanding he turned my frustrations into fabrication “. Took keys off me and promised to call later in the day which he did.
First things first I wanted to see if my AC is back to working order. It’s was blowing air like it was initially before the recall. Asked the engineer about the previous problem why my car was recalled (smell of smoke) and whether the parts which they didn’t have on my first visit. He told me they installed the parts, and then tells me the smoke could be because you haven’t had service for long time. Do you should book an appointment for a service which will cost me £100+ Then I was think he said they installed the parts which were meant to rectify the problem then why do u want me to fix the problem again. And to make matters worse he thinks I dnt reason he’s asking me to rate him highly when I receive the email.!!!!
As if my problems were not enough, days later on a very cold rainy day I put my heater which took for ever to heat up and making matters worse the smell of smoke resurfaced. And on a sunny hot day tried the AC it is not getting cool as it used to do takes forever to get that.
Am asking myself why did I have to taken in my car because it was only made worse."
2018-09-23,5,"No hassle straight forward service., Busy on day of purchase but still dealt with professionally and efficiently."
2018-09-23,5,Always make you feel comfortable and never seem to treat anyone different based on looks or age. Very attentative to the customers needs e.g seating area with drinks and tv. Very good experience every time we attend.
2018-09-23,5,"Booked car in for an investigation into rattle on suspension ( pothole damage! ) technician came with me for test drive to verify the fault, left car with inchape and was provided with courtesy car for the day. Was kept informed of progress in the day and of the action required and cost before work was carried out. Video of the inspection was very good. Service provided by all staff was prompt and friendly, cannot fault!"
2018-09-23,5,I received a very professional service from George Cousins at Inchcape Southampton when buying my nearly new Jaguar E Pace. He fully understood my requirements from the outset and worked very hard to meet my aspirations both in the type of vehicle and financial package.
2018-09-23,5,"I had a really good experience with cooper cobham and my sales agent Marvin Mills. He made my journey of swapping my bmw x6 to a brand new bmw 530d ever so smoothly. He was very helpful, accommodating and gave me alot of options to explore and cater my needs according to my budget. I would highly recommend cooper cobham and this is my second car from them... Will hopefully come back in 3 yrs to get dream car with the same experience I had now."
2018-09-23,1,"I ordered a new car months ago. Mercedes Liverpool knew it wouldn’t be delivered due to new emissions registration changes. I had to call them to find out any information. Had real difficulty getting through as they never answer their phone (over last three weeks anyway), they then tried to ‘up-sell’ me by a car costing me nearly 33% more per month, then they’ve asked me to deal with extending my existing car lease as they know they’ll not be able to deliver - wasting more of my time (several hours back and forth to Lexus and then back to Liverpool Mercedes trying to inform them - but then they don’t answer their phone or return messages or calls promptly). They haven’t even offered any form of ex-gratia payment or goodwill offering for the amount of time and trouble I’ve spent dealing with their mess!! Then they put all the blame on the emissions changes - even though they knew these were coming and had plenty of time to manage this issue! Very uncaring staff, don’t seem to be bothered - certainly the impression they’ve presented to me. Poor, poor customer experience!! Poor show Inchcape and Mercedes!!"
2018-09-23,5,"Coopers BMW Chelmsford, Dealt with Ian in used car section. We received excellent service, very nice person to deal with."
2018-09-23,5,Great service and value
2018-09-23,5,"The company came highly recommended and I was not disappointed. They are extremely helpful, informative and efficient. It was a pleasure to do business with this company and I would not hesitate to recommend it."
2018-09-23,5,"Great experience at the Mercedes-Benz Oxford. Very professional and knowledgable staff. The car was brought in for a parking sensor fault and it was diagnosed accurately.
A reasonable quote for repair also suggested and a wash was done too.
One of the best Mercedes centres and I highly recommend it."
2018-09-22,5,Phil & the team have been great and I’ve had a very pleasurable experience buying my new X2.
2018-09-22,2,On arrival waited 30 minutes for somebody to see me. Gave up and left car keys with reception. Charged for service which should have been free as agreed when purchasing car. Had to return home to get documentation to prove and then received refund ! Advised tyre needed replacing as it had a nail in it . Took car to Quick Fit as BMW did not have tyre and within 10 seconds they discovered there was no nail but a little stone ! no new tyre required ! Received no apology for any of the above. Have now purchased 3 new cars from this garage. Unlikely to do it again. Mike King
2018-09-22,2,"I had to call 4 times to check if ready to no avail. Phone just ringing out at reception ? Eventually went to Mercedes with a lift and supposedly ready. Was pouring down with rain and looked OK but in the morning found that the car hadn't been cleaned properly and the inside certainly had been touched. Very poor service for nearly £500 service. Disappointed. I THOUGHT Mercedes WAS one of the best!
Pamela Warburton"
2018-09-22,5,"Fantastic service, great staff. From the moment my car was collected i was kept informed. Service plan a great option."
2018-09-22,5,I only trust Banstead mini they were accommodating with me needing to drop the car off before opening but gave me the impression they weren’t happy about it. Overall I’m happy but just a few things when I missed a call it took 2.5 hours for my rep to call me back which meant I was late picking the car up. Drop off opening times should be looked as other garages I’ve used you can drop off early but like I said really good garage.
2018-09-21,4,"Really enjoyed picking up my new car. The staff were very helpful, and the bottle of champagne was a lovely surprise."
2018-09-21,5,"Quick, polite and friendly. I was offered refreshments a number of times even though I had only booked in for an MOT. Even so I got a mini valet and left in less than an hour and a half."
2018-09-21,5,Don’t normally like dealing with car salesman from past experiences however I would certainly make an exception for VW Manchester salesman Mr Rick Blackledge. He was hard working and professional. He found me exactly what I wanted and was within my budget. I could not be happier with my brand New UP. I have always bought nearly new in the past so this was my first Brand New Car. He made my experience very enjoyable and stress free. Thanks again
2018-09-21,5,The car had its annual service and MOT. Work performed well and was ready for the required time. no hesitation in taking it back next year...
2018-09-21,5,"I can’t sing the staff at this dealerships praises enough - they are simply fantastic! Their customer service skills are brilliant, they are not pushy with you, explain everything and instantly make you feel at ease. I was looking for any new car as my old Nissan Micra was dying a slow death (RIP Bubbles). We made the decision to get the new car with Toyota mainly due to Cameron’s honest and state the facts salesman’s approach (all the other car dealerships sprouted a lot of Delboy jazz). Cameron has gone above and beyond to help me with any queries etc., Cameron definitely deserves a promotion and a lot more! I brought a lovely new Toyota Yaris (no nickname yet) through finance, everything was explained to me from beginning to end as I was completely new to this. There was a small blip when I went to collect the new car as the DVLA website went down, but I have to stress this wasn’t Toyotas fault. Even though it wasn’t their fault - they still gave me flowers to apologise and a full tank of petrol! I want to say thank you to everyone at this dealership but especially Cameron, Sherif and Simon!"
2018-09-21,1,"My car was picked up for a service and was supposed to be delivered back. Having called to check the status they advised it was out for delivery, just chased them to find out where my car is? Been told that it’s still at BMW Cobham and they will deliver it back in the morning. I raised why was I told it was on its way and was advised that they don’t know why I was told that. Really poor service won’t be using them again."
2018-09-21,5,"I was dealt with by a very informative, caring and attentive sales person, Mr Christopher Belch. Mr Belch couldn`t have been more helpful. He had a wealth of knowledge about the vehicle and was not pushy.
The Mercedes is everything to be wished for. Class, style comfort, economy and comfort."
2018-09-21,2,"I'm upset that my car wasn't valeted or cleaned during a major service, especially as the last words said to me before I left the car at 8am were 'your car will be valeted and cleaned'.My car wasn't ready until 6.30pm and when I asked why it hadn't been done, I was told to 'bring it back' tomorrow! As this would take about 2.5 hours out of my day, I declined. As the fault is with the garage, I feel that they should collect the car and return it cleaned and valeted. I sent an email to this effect which came back with an automated reply that I would get a response within 2 hours - 36 hours later I am still waiting."
2018-09-21,5,"Very impressed with the service I received from Cooper Croydon when my MINI was there for an MOT. The service adviser, Mica, was very friendly and helpful. Have visited another Cooper dealership and the service was nothing like as good. Will use Cooper Croydon in future."
2018-09-21,5,"Excellent service, especially when I brought my dog in (upon staff request!) She was given treats, water and lots of attention. I was also offered a pet cage for her for the courtesy car. Couldn’t have asked for better customer service!"
2018-09-21,5,"Whatever I need, whenever I ring, there is always a cheeful, helpful voice on the end of the phone. My car is collected and returned for MOT and service and the same people come for it as have been coming since the car required MOT, more than 6 years now. This says a lot about the workforce and their conditions. My car comes back valeted and purring. I trust their recommendations and eace of mind knowing the car is well looked after."
2018-09-21,5,"Coopers collected my BMW car from home (free of charge) and carried out the required MOT service/brake fluid change. They then returned my car in a very clean condition.
I was informed of the result of the MOT via a video/email and was given information re near future service requirements.
I was also contacted by phone by one of the staff who explaind outcoms and recommendations.
An excellent service all round."
2018-09-21,5,"Excellent service from Inchcape, Andrew personally delivered the car to London. Couldn't ask for more."
2018-09-21,5,"Px for my car on one of their evoques was smooth and easy and was given a fair deal , the car was as described and am very happy... thanks to Danny and Lilly for an excellent service ."
2018-09-21,5,"Inchcape gave a good trade in price for my SUV. Sales executive Clive did a sterling job when I went to look at the F Pace, so much so that I ordered the Jag and stopped my search for a new SUV. Inchape were very flexible with their finance options and were able to establish a deal that suited me. Even after the delivery (which was a couple of weeks earlier than expected, and Clive comprehensively did the handover) Clive followed up with with several calls to ensure I was happy. I have no hesitation in recommending Clive and Inchcape Derby and I am sure I will return in the future."
2018-09-21,1,My car was not delivered back to me between 3-6pm as agreed. I didn't get a phone call to tell me it was being kept in overnight. This resulted in me having to cancel two meetings the following morning.
2018-09-20,5,"Great service customer/ they were really helpful from manger to sale services they explained and answered all my questions.
Thank you"
2018-09-20,4,"Charlie is professional and efficient. A gentlemen who was working outside helped me with my child when I was struggling to move the baby seat into my small lease car, very thoughtful of him, a nice example of good customer service"
2018-09-20,5,Very good service all round. Thank you George.
2018-09-20,1,I will not even go into it. But take my word this is not only the worst car dealership ever but I would say the worst servcice I have seen from anywhere. This place is an utter joke.
2018-09-20,5,"Quite simply excellent! Everything from dropping off the car for its service, the courtesy, the communication of extra work to be carried out. Great customer service and will be back again... most probably to buy a new car from them!"
2018-09-20,5,"Adam - The Service Manager was so fantastic. His customer service was excellent. What I like about his service was that he listened to my frustration. I was so happy when he told me that he can fix my car the following day though the other woman said that they are fully booked for the whole week. Adam went extra mile and that made me so happy and so pleased with his service. He handled the whole situation in a very profesional manner.

Thank you Adam and of course, Nathan too...Mrs Pips Fernandez"
2018-09-20,4,Laura was very efficient and concise. The cost was more than I was expecting overall but I feel a good job was done. A decent experience and a really well kept dealership.
2018-09-20,1,"I got a used Volkswagen car from Inchcape Telford. They gave all good promise to get the car fix before pick up but they did not. They also gave only one key with the promise to get all sorted within a week. I kept chasing for 2 week as they did not do anything. I decided to return the car for refund. They return the Mercedes I used as part exchange but they lost one of the keys. I told them to replace my lock as replacing the key is not safe enough as anyone who has the lost key can still gain access to my car with the piece of iron key attached to the smart key. they refused as they only want to pay for key replacement. They also did not return my Mercedes until 16 days after I have returned the Volkswagen to them. I incurred over 560 pounds in cost for car rental which they refuse to pay.
To make the whole case worse Volkswagen Finance ''mistakingly'' left a default record on my credit record despite the fact they are aware that the car is returned and I was in contact with them. The devastating thing is that despite contacting them to rectify the mistake, they sent me email confirmation of the rectification but nothing has reflected after 1 month."
2018-09-20,5,"Excellent service ethic. I was really impressed at my first visit to Tetbury Audi a month or so ago and this visit only re-confirmed my impressions.
Excellent. And my 9 year old car was returned looking like new - can't be bad."
2018-09-20,5,"Always receive good service at Cooper Teesside. Very polite, courteous staff."

2018-09-20,5,"Had my Mini picked up for service and returned the same day, even had a video of the service in action sent to me. My car was even cleaned and valeted before return, I cannot fault the service in anyway."
2018-09-20,2,"Very poor customer service The way they talk to you you think you owe them something you try to talk to somebody they always busy or if you leave the message they will never get back to you , They really need to do something about

2018-09-20,5,"This is the second time within a few months that I’ve had dealings with Inchcape Jaguar Derby, firstly with my husband and now independently. Everyone is so friendly, polite but still professional. I must particularly mention the lovely lady, Kim Stuteley who on both occasions has been a gem. This time she has been so helpful, thoughtful and caring. She has made what has been a difficult time for me so much easier.
Full marks."
2018-09-20,5,"Every element of the experience, from the minute i first walked through the door, all the way to picking up my keys was exactly as i had expected from such a reputable dealership.
The signing of the documentation was well handled with minimum effort and the sales person was always in communication."
2018-09-20,5,Efficient and helpful.
2018-09-20,5,First class service.
2018-09-20,5,I would prefer to still have the old style service log book though.
2018-09-20,4,Excellent service from the service desk (Lucy) but appallingly difficult to park.
2018-09-20,5,"Staff couldn’t have done more to help us through buying a car, great thanks to Paul who was helpful & knowledgable in all our questions & quiries. Prestige car & prestige service."
2018-09-20,1,"My Experience with this dealership is totally unacceptable Inchape VW Colchester. This egregious, incompetent service is not to be trusted. I would advise anyone using the Inchcape Volkswagen dealership to approach with extreme caution and skepticism.

On Saturday the 15th September, we made an inquiry with the Inchape VW Colchester dealership with regards to a used vehicle. We were advised that the vehicle was available and an email confirmation was received on the Saturday with a full technical specification from a rep called Andy. We were also advised that the car could be viewed on the Sunday. On the Sunday morning we began our 275-mile journey to the Inchcape Volkswagen dealership Colchester. En route, we called the dealership to confirm that the car is still available, which it was.

After driving approximately 5 hours, we arrived at the dealership only to be told this was a system error and the car is not available. We were made to wait as we got passed on to different sales personnel, presumably as the car was no longer available. We were called into Paul Stocks' Office who advised me that the car was never available, and that it wasn't on site for over 3 weeks. We were given unsatisfactory compensation, with just approximately £40 in petrol.

I was advised that I would receive a phone call from himself, or his sales director David Gray, on the Monday, I waited for the call or email as both contact details were provided, which Paul Stocks wrote in his personal day-to-day book. After waiting over 4 days, I decided today to call Paul. I was given a very vague answer as to why he never called and he attempted to blame it on misunderstanding between him and his sales director.

I was told I would be compensated for the full journey, as I rightly should be, and this was never mentioned during my conversation with Paul. This shows that Paul never had any intention of compensating me and I find that very annoying. I think this says everything you need to know about this dealership."
2018-09-20,5,"I have had great service at Mercedes Llandudno especially from Ben Stanley the sale executive who has been great. I could not recommend Ben highly enough and if you are going to buy a new car then go to Mercedes Llandudno

2018-09-20,5,SIMON WAS THE BEST SALES PERSON I HAVE EVER HAD. HE WASD A PLEASURE. SO CARING AND HONEST. AND EXTREAMLY HELPFUL. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE TO DEAL WITH SIMON IN THE FUTURE
2018-09-20,2,Took my car in for second service at Cooper BMW York. Rang up to book service in and nobody could tell me what was needed and what it would cost me. I would say a price quote is a must due to the fact this service just cost me nearly £500 and according to the service reception should have been nearly £600!! How can you budget budget for a service when they can’t tell you the cost up front? Service took over half an hour longer than stated which isn’t the end of the world but when the rest of the customer service has been poor it all adds up. Got the car on PCP from Cooper York and I am seriously considering not getting another BMW. Customer service is poor and everything costs a small fortune to have done.
2018-09-19,5,"Superb service from Inchcape Audi at Macclesfield.

Adrian looked after us so well, and gave us a great deal on our (nearly) new Audi A3.

We are thrilled with the car, and will definitely go back to Adrian when the time comes for a replacement.

2018-09-19,5,"Efficient, excellent customer care friendly staff, I will definitely consider buying my next car with Inchcape
Thanks Guys"
2018-09-19,5,Very helpfull pleasant staff. Always willing to find answers to questions and helpfull to non tech savvy customers. John Hughes our sales executive was very helpfull
2018-09-19,4,"I had a service which took 1 hour, the customer service and the location was great. However I asked for my car to be washed and it wasn’t done very well and the windows were all smeary so I couldn’t see out of them"
2018-09-19,5,"Peter the service advisor at Swindon Audi has been exceptional, he has communicated with us throughout our emission problems which we initially escalated through Audi UK . We look forward to a successful solution thank you Peter"
2018-09-19,5,"Very easy to deal with, all in all a pleasant experience"
2018-09-19,4,Prompt efficient service and car returned cleaned. One warranty issue I had though not cleared to my satisfaction with the engineer pointing out I would need to pay for a replacement part then they would send the old item back to Mercedes to get them to check it out. If found faulty then they would reimburse. Not sure the engineer had looked at the fault closely enough as I with limited technical experience can see there is an issue. Left unresolved and not to my satisfaction.
2018-09-19,5,"Very efficient. Informed me about things that may need replacing before next service, tyres etc."
2018-09-19,5,"Car was collected from home, serviced and returned to me. I was kept informed of progress throughout the day and received a brief video of the cars safety check from the mechanic on the day.
Excellent service from start to finish and all staff I dealt with were very courteous and professional."
2018-09-19,5,The staff are polite professional with great customer service. I was very pleased
2018-09-19,5,"I’ve just purchased a Jaguar epace and the whole experience from beginning to end was fantastic ! I initially when in on a Sunday and even though there was no new car sales available I was still able to put my car together and purchased it !

From the. My experience was then passed on to Martin at derby Inchcape who kept me informed every couple of weeks they even managed to get my car a month early !

When I picked my car up they had it ready to reveal inside the showroom. The hand Uber was seemless and there even took car of changing my private plate over there and then. Martin then took the time to go over all of the cars function - which it has many if even parking it’s self !!

For the final touch I was given free key rings which was a very nice gesture with a thank you for Choosing Jaguar .

All in all a great experience which would not have been the same if the level of service had not been so fabulous ! Thanks Martin !"
2018-09-19,5,Excellent sales service
2018-09-19,2,Having waited for an extra 2 hours for my mot and service last year I made a point of telling the staff that I didn’t want to repeat this experience and needed to leave at a certain time (to pick my daughter up from school). I’d left 3 hours for the mot and service and was told this was more than ample time. I’d specifically booked the car in for a certain time so I knew I could get back in time for my daughter. I returned at the stated time to be told the car wasn’t finished. I then waited an extra 2 hours for my car to be complete. I wasn’t given a call before I returned to pick up my car to tell me there was a delay. I had to make alternative arrangements to collect my daughter from school and take her to her after school activity. The staff apologised for the delay when he realised I hadn’t left at the expected time but couldn’t give me an explanation for the delay.
2018-09-19,5,"I can thoroughly recommend the service I received from Cooper Thames Ditton BMW.
When I say it was first rate this is not an idle statement it's exactly the level of support I received from the team.
Nothing was too much trouble, I was informed about the progress of the sale all the way through to completion. All questions answered!
I would be more than happy to recommend Cooper Thames Ditton BMW to anyone and would have no doubt about conducting repeat business with them. Excellent!"
2018-09-19,3,"Overall, a failure to add the extra ""polish"" expected of Mercedes-Benz.
No video of car - though on service sheet as heaving been done. Reason when asked next day: ""technical problem"" - with a camera?
Valet ignored boot - did not see a vacuum cleaner.
Just not up to standard expected."
2018-09-19,5,Very professional and helpful
2018-09-19,3,"I do not understand why they had to have my car for the whole day for it's first service, which was an oil change. Arrived 1/2 hour early and was told that my car was not washed and I could wait. No thanks I would much rather just get away. Many manufacturer can give 2 hour time slots for a service which would be ideal. Picked up car all my settings gone, Bluetooth And seat memory. Please don't offer a car clean if it involves waiting all day. 5 o'clock seemed the time for most collections."
2018-09-19,5,Great service
2018-09-19,5,Unlike previous visits all went well. I was greeted immediately and my service booked in promptly. The car was ready sooner than expected and I was very happy all round.
2018-09-19,5,Ray was exceptionally helpful in purchasing my new I-pace. Thank you for making the experience easy and pleasurable. Thank you!

2018-09-19,5,"This is my second Mercedes from Inchcape UK (Oxford) both cars were bought with a service plan. I have not been disappointed, the Service Department is well run with excellent customer service as you would expect with a premium car dealership. I would have liked to keep the courtesy car they provided and although I may move away from Mercedes for the next car Inchcape Oxford will be a hard act to follow."
2018-09-18,4,Straightforward Service B for my car - no problems. Courtesy car of decent quality provided all good.
2018-09-18,5,"Good service, exceeded expectation!
Justine understood the problems I had with the ACC straight away and was very helpful in getting it fixed.
Will recommend."
2018-09-18,5,"Warm welcome upon arrival.
On time, efficient booking in that was discussed by the advisor in the right level of detail for the service of my vehicle.
The courtesy car was very clean, had fuel and the controls were discussed before I left to ensure I was happy before leaving. The courtesy car I was given was a c class coupe cabriolet. The garage contacted me regularly throughout the day to inform me of progress and the car service was finished on time as described. Fantastic service by all the staff"
2018-09-18,5,"Excellent staff.
Great experience."

2018-09-18,5,Great service as always
2018-09-18,5,I have to be honest and say this was my first experience of a Mercedes service and I could not fault any part of it.
2018-09-18,1,"In August my car indicated it needed a service which was handy as the MOT was due. We booked it in but unfortunately there was no courtesy car available. We live some distance from the Garage but my husband decided to get the bus into Chelmsford and return at the allotted time. Unfortunately, the completion time slipped from 12.00, to 13.00, to 15.00.
There is only so much coffee one can drink. However, the paperwork indicated the MOT and service had been completed. A couple of days later, I went to use the car and it indicated it needed a service!! We phoned and were told if it only comes on when you start the car, that is nothing to worry about. We explained that this had never been the case before so were told to “pop in when passing.” As it happened we were going on holiday so it was today that we went, only to be told it did indeed need other things serviced. We were asked if we would like to book it in. I don’t think so!!"
2018-09-18,5,My experience has always been good
2018-09-18,5,After a bit of a shaky start I was very impressed with Thomas' professionalism and knowledge. I was made to feel welcome and comfortable. Even though I was not buying a brand new car Thomas spent a lot of time explaining the options and availability of various used models. The whole purchase process was very straight forward and the overall experience exceeded my expectations.
2018-09-18,5,"Great service, friendly, helpful and knowledgable staff members"
2018-09-18,5,Just excellent customer care service and they even cleaned and vacuum cleaned my car.
2018-09-18,3,"No body on reception,eventually I was guided to a waiting area.I had been in the building almost 15minutes before my appointment commenced.
I was then told my hire car wasn’t ready due to needed a clean(this was 10.15am)
I was unable to take the car as I had forgot my driving licence,although if I had been aware of the delay I may have spent a little more time looking for it.
I was told my car would be ready by 3.30..I would receive a call,especially as i had now to gain a lift.
No call after 3.40pm,so I called,my car was being cleaned.
Another call before 5pm to say my car was ready.
I collected my car,this transaction was smooth & professional"
2018-09-18,5,"Mini obviously care about the customer experience. I was made to feel special and there were no processes that were handled badly, even when there was a small glitch with some paperwork. I would definitely recommend Mini in Thames Ditton to anyone."
2018-09-18,4,Quick efficient service
2018-09-18,5,Simply superb service from Guildford Lexus only one problem had to make own coffee for wife and myself.
2018-09-18,5,"Fantastic, car was picked up and dropped off, valeted and serviced, all covered with a service plan I purchased. Even sent a video of the service to highlight what they had checked, 5*!"
2018-09-18,5,Very helpfull quick to help
2018-09-18,5,"I couldn’t ask for more. Friendly, professional staff, a video from the mechanic showing tyres, exhaust and brakes explaining points to consider in the future and even a hot chocolate while we completed the paperwork. My car was returned clean and shiny. Excellent.
Well done to all."
2018-09-18,5,Great customer service.
2018-09-18,5,"Cannot fault the service at Mini Tonbridge. We are very happy with our car and the service was friendly, positive and efficient. All of our questions were answered and nothing was too much trouble."
2018-09-18,5,They’re the best in keeping records and updates
2018-09-18,5,"I recently bought a used Polo from Inchcape VW Cheltenham and couldn't be happier with the service.
I was looked after from their Sales Executive Mahmoud Ghrab from looking at the vehicle all the way to driving away; Mahmoud was professional, friendly but mostly interested in what I wanted rather than the cliche 'hard sell' .
I had looked at a Polo in the Gloucester VW dealership however I didn't receive any form of customer service so went to Cheltenham and definitely glad I made that choice.
Mahmoud's knowledge of the car was fantastic, helping me through all of the cars systems and making sure I was comfortable with the car before doing a deal.

I would like to thank Mahmoud for his professionalism and customer service and would most definitely recommend Mahmoud, his team and the brand."
2018-09-18,1,"Poor product knowledge, deadlines not met, follow up non existent"

2018-09-17,5,"I have just purchased the jaguar xe R Sport and experienced the best customer service i have received in a long time. Ryan was professional, knowledgeable and very personable. We thoroughly enjoyed our visits to choose and purchase our car. I would have no hesitation in recommending both Ryan and inchcape to family and friends."
2018-09-17,5,"Great Service!
Just had my 3 series tourer in at Coopers Durham to replace a part under warranty.
No hassle at all, once a technician viewed the car, wheels were put in motion so to speak. Slot arranged for a few days later. Part replaced and vehicle returned clean,tidy and spotless.
Absolutely superb. Staff were great,friendly and explained everything.
Would have no hesitation in recommending Coppers."
2018-09-17,5,Both Rob and Adam were exceptional. Very professional and knowledgeable
2018-09-17,5,"From start to finish, I can find absolutely no faults with the service provided by Inchcape Mini. I dealt with a number of people there and was kept constantly updated on the progress of my search for a Mini. Once I received my Mini, they sat with me to explain every detail & control - I felt totally at ease & very grateful for their time. I would have absolutely no issues with using this dealership in future & recommending them, they are all absolutely fantastic."
2018-09-17,5,"Excellent service from start to finish. Competitive cost compared to others and with more to offer such as the ""vehicles health assessment"" backed up with video evidence. Would definitely recommend."

2018-09-17,4,All service issues dealt with professionally.
2018-09-17,5,"Arie and Daniel were a great help when it came to purchasing my new car.
They went above and beyond to make sure things went smoothly, I can’t thank them enough."
2018-09-17,4,"Inchcape provided the easiest purchasing/leasing experience I have had. No negotiating, from looking around on the internet I knew what I was prepared to pay and they immediately came up with a figure that matched it. A lot less adversarial. The only drawback (that cost them the 5th star) was mercedes finance who seemed to be totally unable to deal with somebody returning a car to a dealer after a lease and promised to ring me but didn't despite inundating me with loads of identical texts."
2018-09-17,5,Great service from start to finish. Highly recommended.Thank you
2018-09-17,5,"A great experience all round - from a swiftly organised test drive right up to collecting our new vehicle (and all the bits in between).
Nothing was too much trouble and everything went without a hitch.
Every team member we encountered were friendly and professional.
I would highly recommend this dealership and Steve in particular.
Looking forward to seeing the new showroom too!"
2018-09-17,5,Process of buying a new car was very professional from start to finish. Thanks Oliver.

Catherine"
2018-09-17,4,"Took car to cooper Croydon ,Good overall service ,happy with quality of work however long waiting times to see someone on the service desk. Didn’t get offered a courtesy car first time but when had to re-arrange for car to go in again was offered this time. Wasn’t offered hot drinks or water while sitting there waiting unlike when Iv been Tadworth they have."
2018-09-17,5,Excellent customer service. Friendly and very professional staff
2018-09-17,5,"All went very well, with no outstanding issues."

2018-09-17,5,Martyn took time to explain everything and made the whole proceedure enjoyable
2018-09-17,5,"Had to go outside Cumbria to get best value for a deal on a new BMW. Tried local Carlisle dealer and one at Preston, but these guys blew them out of water by a long margin, deal wise.

Service was good as would expect from a main dealership for the brand, but price wise in another league. May just be my good-luck but worth a punt out of your local dealership area."
2018-09-17,4,Kev was great selling me my used BMW pleasure doing business
2018-09-17,5,"Brought my car in for an MOT. Explained the service light had come on since I booked the MOT. Both MOT and service were done while I waited, about two hours in total. Thank you."
2018-09-17,5,"Very helpful, knowledgeable and non pressurising staff (Suvadeep). Knew all about the car and finance deals."
2018-09-17,5,On time and as promised
2018-09-17,3,"Waited too long in reception, no courtesy car available however did get a lift back
Again waited too long when I arrived to collect it.
The video received is a bit of a gimmick.
The report showed the wrong next service date.
Hence the average score"
2018-09-17,3,"What has happened to BMW - Thames Ditton?
Poor customer service which you would not expect from a BMW.
Too many service bookings for the number of mechanics you have to carry out the service.
Telephone takes a long time to answer and not a good decision to have your service calls now being answered and dealt with in Norwich - not sure what the thinking is behind this.
If BMW want to be seen as a premier/prestige car dealer then they seriously need to improve their Customer care! Staff are all very pleasant - just need more of them to deal with the level of work."
2018-09-17,5,Helpful from start to finish
2018-09-17,5,very quick and polite servu e from staff and very hekpful
2018-09-17,5,"Fast efficient car service, with a magnificent staff completely focused on the customer. Well done Inchcape for attracting great people to your organisation."
2018-09-16,2,"i booked a car service 10/08/2018 for 13/09/2018 online and had confirmation of the booking with a reference number to attend Mercedes of Liverpool. When I arrived at the branch on the 13/09/2018 i was told by the receptionist that my booking was not on the list and that they had no record of my booking and was asked to take a seat whilst she called through to the service department after about 15mins a gentleman arrived and said he had come regarding my service and could i give him my milage so he could do the service and work out a costing for it .I explained that my service was booked on line and that i had confirmation of this and also that i pay for my service on a payment plan . He asked to see the confirmation and on reading the email .He returned to the service dept and returned a short time later and said that it wasn't on their records and didn't know why but he would get the service sorted out.
After a few hours later i received a phone call to inform me that my service was complete and my vehicle was ready for collection. I returned to the branch ,the same gentleman informed me of the results of the service and that my vehicle was ready outside . He handed me my keys and left me and returned to the service dept . He didn't escort me to my vehicle or offer to show me where my vehicle was parked.. I left the building and discovered my vehicle blocked in by another vehicle . I had washed and polished my vehicle the day before but found that after the service it had water marks over the windows /windscreen and chrome work also adblue additive spillage marks running down the paint work from the petrol cap . I returned to the showroom to complain and the same gentleman returned and i explained my disappointment in the way my vehicle was left . He replied that the vehicle isn't valeted only washed and if I had told him earlier that i had cleaned and polished my vehicle he wouldn't have bothered washing it .That's not the point i replied its the state the vehicle has been left in after the service . The gentleman got in my vehicle and drove off at a fast speed sounding the horn into the garage to clean up my vehicle . He returned my vehicle after a short time and i left the branch.
I must say that all was not bad a gentleman who moves customer vehicles and finds parking spaces for customers was very helpful and courteous .
I have had several Mercedes vehicles and have always had my services carried out at this branch but this is the first time I ever had such a poor standard"
2018-09-16,4,The greeting was always welcome and the vehicle handed over in top condition. Follow up communication was poor which needs significant improvement required me to make 3 calls to get hold of my sales person and the receptionist was rude with her remarks of don’t complain to me i passed on your message.
2018-09-16,5,"I used VW's online booking form to arrange for my polo to have a diagnostic check in Exeter after the engine mgt system light started coming on. I was fully expecting to have to pay for this but upon collection of the car, they explained that the fault had been linked to the recent 'cheat mechanism' fix. The repairs were therefore under warranty so I had nothing to pay. In addition, they undertook a health check on the car, sent me a video and cleaned the car inside and out. I don't normally have much to do with main dealers but was thoroughly impressed with the work undertaken on this visit. I was particularly impressed with Jack who took the time to explain everything and clearly took ownership of ensuring everything was resolved successfully. Top work!"
2018-09-16,5,"Inchcape Toyota Nottm

From the moment I drove into the dealership car park where I was met by the manager who directed me to the reception area to when I collected my car, the service was amazing.

The hosts went over and above their duty to make me feel welcome, Charlie who sorted out my paperwork was very knowledgable and respectful.

Finally the technician, Martin, was amazing. For weeks I’ve had a tyre noise a local garage could not fix it with two visits but one visit to Inchcape and it’s sorted. What a relief! Thank you.

I felt that every person I saw had a role to play and were part of a team. Well done."
2018-09-16,5,"The staff at Inchcape are always very friendly and helpful. This time it was Daniel Cooper, Service Advisor. Service carried out by Ryan Deakin.
The car was ready for when I requested, washed and vacuumed.
Thanks."
2018-09-16,5,Excellent service and first class advice
2018-09-16,3,Service was good. But the water wash they did after the service was awful. Usually it is good
2018-09-15,1,"If I could score zero stars, I would.

My Discovery Sport has been nothing but trouble from the day I bought it.

The latest aggravation occurred today, I drove to Cambridge and on the way the “no engine restart in 515 miles incorrect diesel exhaust fluid detected” warning light flashed up.
The diesel exhaust tank was drained and refilled by hunters in the Spring and more ad blue was added to the tank when the car was serviced by hunters in June.
Previously I had filled the tank myself only to be told that the ad blue I’d bought at an ESSO garage was the “wrong” grade.
Not quite sure why I’m now getting the same warning lamp, after Hunters filled the ad blue themselves with the “correct” ad blue. Unless of course, there’s a fault on the car like I suggested 6 months ago? But of course Hunters will string this out until the car is no longer in warranty?
Land Rover assist are no better. I was expected to wait 6-8 hours in Cambridge for a technician to look at my car.
Instead I drove it back on tenterhooks and Land Rover assist are coming out tomorrow. It will need to go back in to be re-set. Once this is done, I’ll sell it. And I will never ever buy a Land Rover again. Shame on you Hunters for the utter incompetence in your product and worse, your dreadful attitude towards your customers."
2018-09-15,4,Easy and quick experience. Thanks
2018-09-15,5,Great customer service and technician explained service and advisory via video email.
2018-09-15,5,"Outstanding Customer Services at the Cooper Norwich branch, so pleased with our recent vehicle purchase. We were served by Scott Joy who we can’t recommend highly enough, he had great product knowledge, offered us exceptional customer service therefore wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to family and friends. Liz and John"
2018-09-15,5,"At first I was a bit put out by the price of the service for my car but honestly, by the end of the process I felt the price was definitely value for money. I had a great experience, from booking it in, to a courtesy call pre service and then Chris Welch at VW Stockport looked after me and my car on the day. He was so helpful, personable and kept me updated. I even got a video of my car being checked over so there was completely transparency. Really pleased."
2018-09-15,5,"I can honestly say that my experience with Derby Mercedes was an extremely happy one.
Although my car I bought was 6 years old I had never had such a lovely car before.
So this was a very special day for me.
I returned home 300 miles with my lovely 6 year old convertible.
I have had it one week and it's like a new car I wish I had been able to buy 1 years ago I am so very happy thank you to Derby for your help and professionalism kindness and generosity, I love my little cap you gave me as an extra.
I think the salesman was called Oli. A lovely professional young salesman thank you.
Kind regards, Carla Shaw."
2018-09-15,5,Always thinking of me as a customer and what suits me and will be best including costs. Nothing is too much trouble and customer service is absolutely great.
2018-09-15,5,Very helpful and excellent service.
2018-09-14,4,Effective and efficient friendly service
2018-09-14,5,"My vehicle failed it’s MOT. I was stranded in Reading and my husband was in hospital. Mini Cooper Reading loaned me a car overnight so I could get home. The next morning they fitted a new alloy wheel, re tested my car all before 12 noon so I could take my husband home from the hospital following his discharge. AMAZING service!"
2018-09-14,1,"Cooper BMW at Croydon.
Had car collected from work expecting to get the car back that afternoon.
No communication from them until I contacted them at half past five to find out that one of the tasks to be carried out was a diagnostic test that can take over 24hours so had to get a lift home with a promise of a call 1st thing in the morning. Come 5 o'clock no communication from them until I rang them only to find that they where delivering my car to my home address and not my work!"
2018-09-14,4,All went smoothly thanks all good.
2018-09-14,5,Excellent service again from Mercedes Benz in Derby. Second time I have taken my car in under warranty and the staff have been welcoming and efficient on both occasions.
2018-09-14,5,"My vehicle was booked in for a MOT, I opted to wait. Results explained and I was on my way."
2018-09-14,5,"Welcoming clean environment, very professional in every way. Would highly recommend."
2018-09-14,4,"Very good service however tried to sell me new pads and discs when it wasn’t even an advisory on the mot.
I have to say excellent overall service otherwise"
2018-09-14,5,Great customer service. Simon was very helpful and friendly.
2018-09-14,4,"So far so good at Inchcape VW Cheltenham. I have ordered a new T-roc with them and they have offered me an excellent, professional and personal service. I live in Gloucester which has a VW dealership, which never replied to me so tried Inchcape. Glad I did! I have also been kept up to date with the delays new VW's are currently experiencing, with no nasty surprises."
2018-09-14,5,"I recently purchased a 2017 VW Polo from Inchcape in Cheltenham. I'm always a bit dubious about going to a dealership because 9 times out of 10 the sales guys are going to try and flog you alot of rubbish that you don't want or necessarily need, especially as a woman going in alone.
On this occasion the sale was handled by Mahmoud Ghrab and I came away refreshingly surprised by how well he handled everything. Mahmoud is professional, friendly without being OTT, cheesy or pushy and clearly has excellent product knowledge. I had actually fallen in love with the GTI which was way more expensive to both buy and run. Mahmoud went through my requirements with me and whereas somebody else might have just said, yes, buy it! It's only a few thousand more!! - Mahmoud was actually highly professional, went through the pros and cons and eventually I came away with something that better fitted my needs. I could be naive and maybe the profit margin was better and he got a better commission, who knows....but i liked the fact that he talked everything through with me and actually, the car i bought was perfect. I would recommend dealing with Mahmoud 110% to friends and family and as a brand, you can't fault VW for their products."
2018-09-14,5,"Fantastic! Exceeded expectations. For Toyota to offer a free recall on a 15 year old car is amazing. The car runs as new. Your visual inspection was thorough and confirmed what we already knew, that the car was in perfect working order.

The valeting was not expected and was very welcome.

A big thank you"
2018-09-14,5,"Excellent service, made booking following a prompt phone response.
On day of booking was attended to immediately, and notified/agreed items for servicing (brake pads/discs). The service took 50% longer than initially indicated due additional items required (discs), however this was acceptable to me.
Clear summary of work done, and as my car was just outside warranty these brake items attracted a very significant discount (40%) on the Jaguar 3+ offering. I suggest that Inchcape advertise this more widely to attract Jaguar customers outside warranty. The discounted price was very competitive with non Jaguar service shops."
2018-09-14,5,"Booked my car in for 1st service as soon as the service indicator came on. Received a call from Sarah as a reminder 3 days beforehand and to discuss collection form my workplace. Received a text reminder the day before. Car collected from work at the time stated and this was a very easy process. Received email and text about the Audi car cam and then a call from Sarah in the service team which I missed. I called back and spoke to a colleague to discuss the service and make payment. Car returned cleaned and vacuumed.

All in all simple, easy, polite, knowledgeable and value for money."
2018-09-14,5,"Fast, friendly service"
2018-09-14,5,Check in and out for my car service were completed with polished administration efficiency and the car was returned in immaculate condition.
2018-09-14,3,Ultimately a good service was provided but the collection process was organised with very late communication and initially a lack of awareness that a collection was required.
2018-09-14,5,"Extremely satisfied with my annual service and MOT. Friendly, Helpful , knowledgeable staff. All good."
2018-09-14,5,"Very helpful , easy to explain everything
Can’t fault the service .
Thank you"
2018-09-14,5,"Excellent from start to finish. No “your car needs a new engine” rubbish. An honest main dealer. Hassle free full service and MOT. I needed a new wheel nut to pass the MOT. For the sake of £5 they made the decision to simply fit one, pass it, and give me the good news. No they’re not the cheapest, but I’m a firm believer in you get what you pay for.
Thanks guys."
2018-09-14,5,"Coopers Mini Croydon Sales experience
The best sale experience I’ve ever had. I purchased a used Mini Countryman from a lovely lady called Lefko at Coopers Croydon what a fantastic service she provided no pressure sale, excellent test drive, smooth purchase and collection of my new car. The car was ready on time with everything promised all the paperwork ready a very professional and relaxed experience. I would highly recommend Lefko and Coopers Mini Croydon."
2018-09-14,5,"Jason who was our Sales Executive was very polite and gave us all of the correct information before we arrived.

A smooth experience!!!"
2018-09-14,5,New 320i m sport Tourer checked for exhaust fumes in cabin. Car was taken in at 8:30 am and returned to me by 11:00 am. All ok
2018-09-14,5,Had my older BMW in for some work. Waited 10 minutes at the start of the day for the adviser and ended up with the supervisor. The work was carried out correctly and was ready in time. Car was clean and even inside windows cleaned. Shame there was nobody around again from the service department or reception to talk to pay for the work...
2018-09-14,5,"Great service from Chris Martin at Inchcape VW Stockport, nothing was too much trouble and made my experience of buying a car easy.
The manual was missing but Chris immediatley sorted it and took ownership of the problem so I was reassurred it will be replaced.
Having one point of contact during sale made it so easy.
Thanks to Chris ..."
2018-09-13,3,"Booked service, waited far to long to be seen both dropping up and picking up. Walked back in to ask another question and waited another hour"
2018-09-13,5,Excellent service!
2018-09-13,5,Thank you to Julie and Stephen in your help purchasing my new BMW
2018-09-13,5,"From the moment of booking the car in, Abbie in service was very professional, escorting me to the loan car, & keeping in contact during the day advising updates.
This dealership is just pure perfection & professionalism, everybody in the dealership looked sharp.
I even got a video to show some defects with my car.
To many people talk down main dealers, but not this one.
I will use them with out a thought for my servicing needs.
Well done Abbie & the team."
2018-09-13,5,Excellent service from Coopers in reading Would fully recommend
2018-09-13,3,"Friendly staff to make the service booking however there was some considerable wait for a slot where either a curtesy car or collection option was free. Something this dealership needs to address as they have recently moved some way out of town so are not that accessible.
The cost of service is extremely high compared to BMW, it’s hard to justify this and I feel the new process of recording service history online, while being more resilient to fraud, has been done to stop third party servicing- attempting to remove choices from the customer.
The collection service wasn’t well communicated, I had to phone up to ch check when they would collect the car (ended up past the 11:30hrs latest time).
The curtesy ‘Bronze wash and vac’ was more chipboard quality. Audi do a far better job. I’d suggest you either stop doing it or do a better job.
The short video to show the health check of the car covered the tyres well giving useful advice, then mentioned the brakes and that was all - hardly a heath check so I’m glad they aren’t my doctor.
The invoice commented on the infotainment system problem I’d advised (yes it’s an F Pace.....) saying a software upgrade was required and this may take more time. I don’t know if I have to book it in again so guess I’ll have to phone them again.
Have to trust the service was completed correctly but guess that’s what I’m paying for. Love the car still!"
2018-09-13,5,"Exceptional Customer Service
Excellent experience from start to finish, friendly, experienced people. Provides you with the confidence to let them get on with it! A pleasurable no stress experience, with courtesy shown by all staff.
I will be recommending Inchcape to my friends, colleagues and family."
2018-09-13,5,"Always a pleasant experience however , on this occasion following an MOT and full service my car was not washed as promised as it normally has been in the past . Not essential , but a nice touch I think you will agree ."
2018-09-13,5,Excellent services
2018-09-13,4,Seemed to be a bit rushed through and not enough time given to explain any issues I had with the car
2018-09-13,5,"It was a pleasure to deal with Tim Green and his colleagues and I drove away from Cooper York a very happy customer confident I had made the right purchasing decision .
Criticism is limited to the amount of paperwork accompanying vehicle collection . Tim was very efficient but Cooper's should reduce the volume of paperwork to make the occasion even more enjoyable ."
2018-09-13,5,Very happy no complaints
2018-09-13,5,It very helpful and with excellent job
2018-09-13,5,Everything explained and done as expected. Comfortable environment when waiting for service to be done.
2018-09-13,1,"Arrival:

1. I booked my appointment online for 8am - and the estimated time for the service was 2hrs 6mins, with a price of £458.

2. I left in good time to ensure I arrived on time, knowing that there are roadworks in the area and didn't want to miss my slot.

3. I arrived at 7:52 to find the doors still locked so went and sat in my car until 8am

4. When my 'greeter' came to see me we went through the details, I had a recall letter, an issue with collision plus message and apparently you had another recall - so estimated 2hrs 30mins. They would get straight on it when the workshop opened at 8:30!



Why have I booked in for 8am when you don't start work until 8:30am?



Lounge:

5. Your complimentary Wifi entails me going through a laborious sign up process with Sky - to find it then does not work! So I connect via my iphone personal hotspot.

6. I had 2 x coffees, the standard of which was passable - but i suppose they were 'free'. You could do with investing in a much better drinks machine.



Return:

7. At 11:13, your 'greeter' came over and said the car was just with valeting and would be available soon. We went through the bill - it had come down to £446 (result!)

8. I then waited until 11:35 for the key to come back, we walked out to my 'clean' car.

9. I opened my boot, it had not been vacuumed. The rim around the bottom of the rear windscreen was still filthy.

10. I got in the car, it had been vacuumed. The dash was still dusty, none of the trim had been wiped down. I expect to drive away with my car performing and looking like the day I first got it. Mechanically it may be perfect - but if your trying to exceed my expectations you missed by a mile!

11. Whilst I was taking this in, another customer then arrived and blocked me in. So I had to walk back into the showroom and ask him to move as he had just blocked me in. We both agreed, the parking arrangements are ridiculous, there are not enough spaces for customers.



I left from my annual service 3hrs 43mins after arriving feeling 'mugged'. I was under the impression that Mercedes was at the premium end of the market - the price certainly reflects this 'aspiration' - the experience I got was far from it.



Note: Your personnel were pleasant all the way through. This is not a personnel issue, this is a process/business issue."
2018-09-13,2,"Disappointed customer
I came in after 2 recalls were made on my vehicle. I was informed the appointment would last 1 hour so brought my 9 month old Don with me to wait. Nearly 3 hours later my car was finally ready. Had I known it would take this long I would have asked someone to either pick up the car or simply organise childcare rather than trying to manage a baby in a dealership for that long."
2018-09-13,5,Very customer focused and professional
2018-09-13,5,First time at Volkswagen Stockport. Great experience from start to finish. James was excellent and the mechanic made a video of the underneath of the car explaining as he went. Constant updates on the progress of the car.
2018-09-13,5,"Great service booking made promptly ready on time friendly service from Mark and team
Only one thing stop using traffic film remover on service wash very crossive and makes door rubbers go white
Other than that fantastic service"
2018-09-13,2,"Only dropped in for a recall. It took nearly 2 hours rather than 40mins, car wasn't very well cleaned and the wifi is awful. Cant even use normal signal because the roof seems to block it!

Nice coffee though."
2018-09-13,1,"Poor - little transparency of prices. I went to book my car in for a service with Mini Cooper Surbiton, the key fob was read and I was advised a brake fluid service was required at a cost of £90. A few days later I rang to check and was advised it would cost £70. I then checked on line and saw the price was £57! Rang Mini and told that £57 would be the price I would be charged. Took car in for the service and was advised price would be £70, queried this and they agreed to the online price of £57. Left my car for this service. I was then contacted to say more work was required - oil change, spark plugs and microfilter service etc, so the total would be £350! How come within 2 weeks of booking the service, all this additional work was required? It is very concerning that a large organisation appears to be so lax with their pricing structure and why was I quoted 3 different prices for the same service?"
2018-09-13,5,Completely satisfied with the all round efficiency and service provided by the Pall Mall service team. Great of technology to keep you informed about what has been done and authorisation of work to be done.
2018-09-13,5,Nick Jimson couldn't do enough to make sure I was happy with my new car. I purchased an M-Sport and was overjoyed with the car and how special the purchase process felt.
2018-09-12,1,"I had to say I had the worst ever customer service! Absolutely unhelpful! Especially the manager who explained to me the service job they did on my car, he didn't even had an idea what was done but just know how much to charge me. Attitude was poor, arrogant and unsupportive. Any negative word would just apply to him. That's just my personal experience hence wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Personally I wouldn't go there again despite I have been using them for serve for many years! Enough is enough. Please check out reviews from others as well"
2018-09-12,5,"I’m pleased with my car and believe that BMW have an interest in keeping it well maintained. It’s quite expensive though, cost £850 more or less for a service. They did find an expensive fault which they have offered to do and cover the cost so fair play. I trust them and am pleased with the service"
2018-09-12,4,The staff are very efficient and helpful. The only problem I have is that nobody contacted me regarding extending my warrantee; I brought this up when telephoning but the response was that BMW always contact the customer regarding extending the warrantee when it is near to running out - they did not contact me. I was also not aware that breakdown cover is included in the warrantee and paid another company for cover for the whole period which I am quite annoyed about.
2018-09-12,5,great service I will definitely go back to get my next car
2018-09-12,5,"Peter was very good during the sale, while i was waiting for the car to arrive and collecting the car."
2018-09-12,1,"I had my c class in for a warranty repair last week. Came back late, had the car three days, didnt return calls, scratches on the bonnet, bad valet clean missed behind the wing mirrors, in the gaps of the seat etc. totally useless

Absolute shower of shít

Go to BMW or Audi next time instead of this incompetant company!"
2018-09-12,5,"Great Easy Simple Service , Thoroughly Recommend !"
2018-09-12,5,"Recently purchased new vehicle on PCP Quick turnaround to handover very good customer care, and good deal. Would definitely recommend for BMW Ownership in this area."
2018-09-12,5,"From the moment, I walked into Liverpool Mercedes, I received great customer service. Lee Philips took time to understand what I needed from my next car and to help me select the perfect car to match my requirements. Throughout the purchase and collection and even now, I have received outstanding customer service and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them."
2018-09-12,5,Everything went to plan and the communication from the garage was excellent. The service was completed well ahead of schedule and I was able to collect the vehicle much earlier. The complementary clean was also most welcome.
2018-09-12,2,"As arranged over the phone took my car in for an MOT at 10 am. Told to take a seat and someone would be with me shortly. After 30 mins. no one had come. I asked at reception and Service and was then told that I wasn't due to be seen for some time. Managed to speak to the Service personnel who let me sign the paperwork and was told that the MOT would not be carried out until early afternoon!! Why had I been told to be there at 10 am? I later learned that this is just a ""drop off"" time and if I want it done at a specified time I have to book a ""while you wait"" fast track appointment. Why was I not informed of this when booking the car in. Arrived back at BMW at 3.30pm having wasted the time in Kingston to be told the MOT had still not been carried out but would be done in the next hour and a half - unbelievable. Finally done and left the garage at 5pm!! What an absolute dreadful day. Also the waiting area has been moved and put behind a wall out of sight of the service personnel. It was as if it had been hidden away and preference given to car sales. Very uncomfortable feeling just staring at cars and listening to people discussing purchases. Having been a customer of Cooper Thames Ditton for over 20 years this has been my worst experience in all that time. Things are obviously changing at Coopers. I will however give a gold star to the parts department who are always very friendly and helpful."
2018-09-12,5,We were well looked after and given clear information by a knowledgeable and friendly staff. Chris M was especially helpful. Communication was excellent promises kept.
2018-09-12,5,Great service from all the staff. Kept updated on the delivery of my car and a smooth sale.
2018-09-12,1,I would not have awarded any stars if this was allowed. Abysmal service at Cooper Cobham. Car was booked for service and new brake pads. Brake pads not replaced as they did not have the lock to take the wheels off. No one rang me to say the car was ready so it had been ready 3 hours when I called. I had to take the car back the following week for the brake pads. Despite arranging this I was not on the service list. I was told the brake pads would take an hour. It was not ready after nearly 2 hours. Totally unacceptable level of service
2018-09-12,1,"Took my nearly two year old Discovery Sport in for its first service and they did the complementary Visual Health Check.They ""amber"" highlighted the Discs/drums section reporting that the front discs were slightly scored and the rear discs slightly corroded. There was a fitted price of £291.53 quoted. I contacted them to explain that the car was under warranty which was obvious. I pointed out that the rear discs had been replaced the previous July for corrosion and that I expected these issues to be fixed also under warranty. I was told they couldn't authorise that and I should contact Landrover direct. I stated that I shouldn't have to do that under the Sale of Goods Act my contract is with Hunters. Anyway, after much discussion I reluctantly did contact Landrover and after several phone calls Landrover advised me there was nothing wrong with the brakes. Hunters though out were very uncaring and insular. But my question to them which has never been answered is why did they give me the impression that there was something wrong with the brakes which could be fixed for £291.53 when the manufacturer found no fault. Is that not fraud!
Incidentally, I have been waiting since June for a test drive in a petrol powered Discovery Sport and despite actually turning up for a test was told there wasn't one available. I have been a customer since 2002 and have bought seven new Landrovers from them, If service doesn't improve this one will probably be my last!"
2018-09-11,5,Brilliant service from ordering the car to its delivery. Thank you Jonathan and the rest of the team at BMW Malton
2018-09-11,5,Brilliant service as usual - Stuart Johnson head of servicing came and said hello introduced himself and his team made me feel very relaxed thanks all xx
2018-09-11,5,Great customer service from Ben - good that our car was looked after by a professional company. Many thanks!
2018-09-11,5,Thank you for a Polite caring professional service. Well done
2018-09-11,4,"Excellent service from Harry, so friendly and helpful and no pressure. Look forward to long association."
2018-09-11,5,"Excellent buying experience! Extremely happy, new A class in fantastic."
2018-09-11,5,"Servicing for a Mercedes is expensive. Part of me wanted to pay about half as much and get it done elsewhere . In the end I bit the bullet and paid up. It hurt but I did it.
The staff are generally pleasant. Coffee and newspapers were welcome as I waited.
In the end I was pleased that the service had been done by a main agent.....despite the cost."
2018-09-11,4,Had good experience buying approved used car.
2018-09-11,5,First class service from the ladies on reception though to Emma who delt with me at the service desk extremely pleased
2018-09-11,5,Work carried out to high standard. No delays and excellent communication
2018-09-11,3,"Good:
They carried out an unplanned MOT test on my car when I requested one an hour or so after delivery for a service.
Bad:
1. Upon delivery, I had to wait for around 10 mins to be seen by the service dept.
2. I didn't receive a call back when I asked for a progress update.
3. Upon collection, I had to wait for around 20 mins to be seen by the service dept."
2018-09-11,5,Great service as always onto my 4th car from these folk now
2018-09-11,3,"Service was standard, not very friendly staff.
Not great when I'm looking for a new car next year."
2018-09-11,5,Very professional company to deal with
2018-09-11,5,Excellent service throughout.
2018-09-11,5,"Friendly courteous and professional comes to mind.
Very helpful in my choices of specifications needed for my F Pace R Sport and a big thank you to Ella in sales love the end result."
2018-09-11,4,"Hi
Good service, administration effortless, attention to detail should be improved though, overall a good experience."
2018-09-11,5,"Extremely helpful from the minute I walked in to collecting my car later on, very professional & courteous service which I will certainly use again."
2018-09-11,5,"Staff were very welcoming, efficient and polite. I was sent a video of the checks on my car which I found very interesting. An enjoyable experience"
2018-09-11,5,"Took my car into Mercedes at Cheshire Oaks for a service B and an MOT, I was really pleased when I got a video of what they where doing. Also not long after I had a call to say they had found a turbo seal split and also the drive belt was showing it’s age, 13 years. That also needed changing before it broke. Now the car runs like new and it starts a lot better.
I am very happy with the service they provided."
2018-09-11,2,"Having had an email from Mercedes at Cheshire Oaks asking for a review, here it is.
This all stemmmed from this Dealership failing to deal with a safety recall 3 months after they cancelled an appointment to rectify the fault.
It’s only happening because I wrote a Trust Pilot review about that experience.
Yes they invited me to repeat exactly what I’d said in the review via a web link to them, which I did, and yes I got a phone call from Cheshire Oaks saying......wait for it......”sorry” and yes the car has since been taken in, fault rectified and returned to me with the car hoovered inside and washed on the outside. So the matter has been resolved.
But am I expected to review the “sorry”, the car wash and hoovered interior and the safety recall issue resolved without pointing out the blatantly obvious comment that none of this would have happened if I hadn’t written a bad review in the first place?
So 2 stars reflect a poor experience of Inchcape which is backed up by a previous hideous experience of the dealership at Liverpool but balanced by a very positive review of the Warrington dealership.
Conclusion - Go to Warrington or Llandudno or find another Mercedes dealership outside of Inchcape. On balance if I had a choice I wouldn’t step foot in an Inchcape dealership again but that’s very very difficult when there are warranties etc to deal with."
2018-09-11,4,"Black Audi A3
Thank you for fixing my car on Saturday I received great service from Inchcape UK and will be happy to use them again.

2018-09-11,5,"An excellent service. Jay listened to our requirements for a new vehicle and suggested various models. Details of the model we chose were explained to us in detail and questions were answered clearly and professionally.
We were kept up to date with the progress of our order, and Jay went to great lengths to assure us that changes could be made if we wanted them. We never felt pressured to take any extras, those we chose were demonstrated clearly giving us the opportunity to see what we were buying eg the car protection kit.
Jay was more that willing to spend a long time with me explaining the features of the car, and was very patient, going over details when necessary.
He has followed up on the sale with a courtesy call to see how things and going which was a nice touch."
2018-09-11,5,Friendly professional service
2018-09-11,5,"I had intermediate serves for my Lexus IS250 yesterday. The car was picked from my housesat 9.20am, inspection videos sent to me by email and the car once serviced was delivered to my house by 2.50pm.

Great service in my opinion."
2018-09-11,4,"Service - booking in dropping off and picking up car, was very good and well handled by the various staff members. Will use them again"
2018-09-11,5,THE SERVICE AND AFTER SERVICE WE RECIEVED FROM SYDNEY DYKES WAS SECOND TO NONE.REALLY PLEASED WITH ARE MINI AND WOULD RECOMMEND COOPER SUNDERLAND TO ANYONE WISHING TO PURCHASE A MINI.YOU SHOULD ASK FOR SYDNEY DYKES.
2018-09-10,1,"Awful. I ordered a 3 door automatic car and a 5 door manual was delivered. Mistakes happen, but you judge people on how they put their mistakes right. I have waited 2 1/2 weeks for a refund and despite promises & excuses funds have not arrived. This has been escalated to BMW UK.
I would avoid at all cost in case something goes wrong. There are plenty of other BMW dealers out there who I am sure would care more about their customers."
2018-09-10,5,Really happy with our new Mercedes GLA. Staff were extremely friendly and informative with special thanks to our sales man Kal.
2018-09-10,5,"Booked my car in for a service, staff were friendly, all done in under two hours."
2018-09-10,4,Very good service and we love our new mini clubman. Will be back to perches a new one in the future.
2018-09-10,5,Just bought my first jaguar from Inchcape in Preston massive thanks to Katie who made me and my family feel welcome and made the whole experience of buying a new car a happy one. I would highly recommend this dealership for the quality of customer service I have received and was not made to feel like I was made to feel when buying from the last dealership I purchased a new car from. The service and not much so difference is price I wouldnt look back. Highly recommended and great car throughout.
2018-09-10,5,Excellent customer service - very impressed with the one hour service whilst you wait (and the vehicle was vacuumed and washed within that timeframe too). 10/10 Warrington Mercedes - Well done!
2018-09-10,5,"Friendly dealership, about as stress free as you can get when buying a car.

Jason was very helpful and we are happy with our new car !"
2018-09-10,5,Matt & Tony were both a pleasure to deal with. Really quick easy process. I am very happy with my vehicle and would definitely recommend Inchcape UK. Thanks again for all your help.
2018-09-10,5,From start to finish the service I received from Stuart at Mercedes Southport was excellent. Thanks so much and I love my new car
2018-09-10,2,"I was quoted £209 for my service which I had budgeted my month for. When I arrived they informed me that the service will actually cost £430 which has caused me great difficulty. I then mentioned that my fan system keep cutting out but was infomred that this would cost me an additional £99 if they opened it up and found it wasn't to do with a part covered by my warrrenty, thats not including the cost of the labor and replacement part."
2018-09-10,5,"HI
great service as always .. thank you for all the professional help"
2018-09-10,5,"From start to finish I experienced great customer service from Cheryl, she's patient and helpful and answered the numerous questions I had throughout the whole process. From test drive to exchange I can't complain everyone I came across in the dealership were all great and really down to earth which made me feel really comfortable. I hope the fab service continues with the aftercare of my purchase."
2018-09-10,4,Great customer service.
2018-09-10,5,My criteria was listened to and the car was matched to suit my needs with pleasant and efficient service.
2018-09-10,5,"The overall experience was fantastic. Anything is possible approach. We felt like a customer should feel, important and we’re looked after extremely well by Jason. Jason was very knowledgeable about all aspects of the vehicle we enquiried about, any questions we had were answered honestly, which is important to us, and he did everything within his power to make the deal we were after happen. Very Satisfied."
2018-09-10,1,"Yes it is as bad as the one star reviews suggest, at least in the Service department. Inaccurate estimates, wrong parts ordered, lack of communication, missed and extended deadlines with no real appreciation of the knock-on effects to the customer, 40 min wait times to handover and pick-up your car are common. Massive improvements needed.
Won't be back – can’t face it !

Please don't ask me to contact you Inchcape - I'm not interested and reading previous comments you won't do anything to 'work towards a resolution' anyway"
2018-09-10,5,"Seamless service from Hunters during our recent purchase.
Professional, knowledgable service from Andrew Heynes made our experience simple and problem free.
Would definitely recommend and would return for future purchases."
2018-09-10,5,"Top service as alway from Cooper Ipswich. Always trust them with my M3

2018-09-10,3,"car parking at this dealership is very poor ! but I was expecting this so had given myself plenty of time . Car booked in for 10am arrived 9.55 at reception , then left in the service holding area for nearly 30minutes before handing my keys over was told when I booked they would need the car for 4 to 5 hours so I was expecting 3.30-4.00 however it would be later because it's from when they start working on the car . Any way i return to collect my car after a phone call and after waiting around for a while they gave me my paperwork but said they had not done the sat nav update due to not having the part and would need to order this even though I had booked it in for this several weeks ago and to just pop back again like it would take a few minutes more likely to take me 90 minutes with traveling , parking and waiting around . The whole experience at this dealership did not seen to live up to a prestige well organised garage I'm afraid"
2018-09-10,3,Thanks Nathan and Sam for the purchase of my F Type R. Great support! Vincent F.
2018-09-10,5,"The entire experience with Copper BMW Colchester from the initial viewing of the car to collecting it on Friday, was an absolute pleasure.
Simon was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble when explaining the many functions of the 6 series ""toys"" and controls.
All in all, a first class service!!

I just wish I lived closer as i have had some negative experiences with my local dealership with my M cars."
2018-09-10,1,"Catastrophically appalling service - Cooper BMW Kingston

I never expected such low level service from a mail BMW dealership. I booked my car in for a routine service and the dealership assured me they would collect it from my house between 08.30-11.30. On the day no sign of them, I call twice, eventually called back to tell me that at 11.30 they were just leaving the dealership and would be an hour. I had to go to work, so then they just told me to leave the keys in a safe place and they would sort. Car goes in. I am then told it in fact has a re-call on the convertible roof part and they need to do this and will not be able to complete that day. Good job I don't need my car over the weekend. Over the next full week, I called and called and called and eventually was told on Thursday that they had done the roof, but not the MOT it apparently now needed. I call numerous times Thursday and Friday, then miss a voicemail on Friday night (8pm!!) to tell me my car is ready and I can collect it, despite repeated messages from me to them to say I would not be around and they were supposed to deliver it. I have JUST managed to get hold of them again (Monday) to finally get them to promise to deliver my car back today.

Their Customer Service is APPALLING. They do not communicate, there is clearly no link between whatever is or isn't going on in the service department and then you will be fobbed off with a myriad of excuses about them being busy. I wouldn't trust them to service my bike and I certainly wont ever be taking either of our BMWs back there, let alone spending any of my head earned cash on a new car from them. We were warned by a neighbour about how bad they were, I wish we had heeded their advice. All I can do is warn people to avoid ever ever using this dealership, so that your time wont be as wasted as mine has so comprehensively been."
2018-09-10,5,Very professional. Seamless service. Kept well informed and all done within the timescale.
2018-09-10,5,Great service by Josh the service representative kept me informed throughout the day with progress
2018-09-10,4,"First service - booking easy via website and able to do online excepting adding any comments, still had to call the next day.
Arrived to find car park overflowing with cars and all lanes blocked with cars. Found a space and parked up, the now usual car dealer take a seat and someone will be out when a key drop would suffice.
Collection and another car dealer who likes to keep you waiting for the return of your keys albeit 40 minutes quicker than the nearby BMW dealer but 10 minutes slowing than the Audi dealer across the road.
Service done, contact text / email to confirm car available for collection - slightly over advised time advised on website booking. No actual problem with that.
Car washed & front interior vacuumed out - certain I took in the A Class & not our SLK so not sure why the rear didn't witness the vacuum.
Sticking with them for the next service"
2018-09-10,5,Friendly team no1
2018-09-10,5,Excellent service from collection of car to delivery back
2018-09-10,1,"Poor service as usual, with staff chatting instead of serving. Car poorly washed as always.
We suspect that our car has been taken on a jolly as it was showing approximately 35miles less remaining in the tank than when it was dropped off, for a MOT."
2018-09-10,5,Excellent service picked up and delivered back in half a day.
2018-09-10,5,I have dealt with various Land Rover dealerships over many years and have always had a very good experience. This was the first time I had dealt with Inchcape at their Southampton branch and they certainly maintained that reputation of quality of service. Would highly recommend.
2018-09-10,5,"very efficient, kept fully informed, nice courtesy car."
2018-09-10,4,Very good salesman very polite and knowledgeable . Fair but understanding
2018-09-10,5,An excellent experience from start to finish - special thanks to Hilary!
2018-09-10,5,"Excellent while you wait service from Cooper Mini, Ipswich for an MOT and brake service. A couple of minor adjustments nade free of charge during the MOT and car returned cleaned and ready to go.

I enjoyed WIFI to keep working and tea from the helpful staff while the car was attended to."
2018-09-10,5,Cooper BMW-Cobham met and exceeded my expectations. A reasonable price was agreed and accepted quickly. The vehicle was made ready for delivery quickly. The salesman drove if from Cobham to Hertfordshire and was exceptionally pleasant in taking me through the paperwork. The vehicle was approved by BMW -Cobham and the standard is excellent to the extent the bodywork and wheels look like new. Will be more than happy to deal with BMW-Cobham again
2018-09-10,3,I took my car for a service it was due engine oil change and a filter change was charged £266 and was sent a video which only showed me my car up in the air had a good view of underneath they told me how well looked after my car had been but I never saw the oil change or the filter changed and they also told me that my car was being cleaned which it had not been washed or vacuumed at all a very expensive video I feel!
2018-09-10,5,"Great experience. Easy to book, great communication through out the day regarding drop off, work carried out and collection. Highly recommended!"
2018-09-10,5,"Very high standard of service and kept me fully advised of the process at every stage.
Thank-you!"
2018-09-10,5,"I recently had my car in for service and MOT at the Warrington branch of Inchcape Mercedes. The whole experience was very good, especially from the service representative (Emma) who kept me up to date with the work being done. I also had a problem with the vehicle (that a previous dealers could not fix) that the team in Warrington dealt with fantastically - Even allowing me to keep the courtesy car an extra day as I was on holiday (thank you Paul). I cannot recommend the aftersales/service from this team enough!"
2018-09-09,5,"Buying from Mini Cooper Sunderland was an amazing experience. From the moment I walked into the showroom the first time I was given time and space to look and get a feel for the cars. Not being bombarded was a huge tick on my list.
From this point, Grace Robson provided the best service I have ever received in any shop environment. She made me feel so comfortable and gave a lot of information which was important on making a choice between Mini and another car maker.
The test drive with Grace was so laid-back as I was very nervous since the test drive car was only the second car I've ever driven in my 5 years of driving. Once returning back to the showroom, my decision was made on a Mini Convertible and I am still 1,000,000% sure that it was the right car for me.
I would highly recommend Mini Cooper Sunderland and Grace Robson to anyone and everyone."
2018-09-09,4,"Overall good. Staff friendly and thorough. However, took too long in the morning when dropped car off. Disappointing the car I was taking whilst my car was being serviced had to be taken to be fuelled before I could take it meaning I was late for work."
2018-09-09,1,A very poor service at VW Bromborough. Poor quality cars with known faults. This can be seen with two identical Beetles currently on their forecourt that I rejected and eventually had my money refunded. After sales care is abysmal.
2018-09-09,5,The service I received was excellent. Easy and straightforward. Aaron was very friendly and helpful
2018-09-09,1,If incape refers to the ‘insurance’ on bumps and marks I think it is awful
2018-09-08,5,"Recently bought a car from Ben at inchcape warrington. Went out of his way to find a car that suited and nothing was to much trouble, can not recommend enough !! Thank you !!"
2018-09-08,5,"Friendly, welcoming, comfortable and a really enjoyable experience and was very excited when picking up new car. Nothing seemed to be a trouble. Excellent communication."

2018-09-08,5,"Excellent service inc pickup and delivery. No problems, and painless."
2018-09-08,1,"The Garage failed to organise a car when my car was being repaired, the part was delayed for over two weeks longer than advised

The garage was supposed to review and fix an air-conditioning fault, but when I pick up my car after the original fault was fixed they had not even looked at the air conditioning fault that had been highlighted. I had to go back for a another day for this to be fixed

However, I would highly praise the support I received from the service assistance James who gave me excellent service"
2018-09-08,5,"First service for Jaguar XE. Booking was easy and reception at garage first class. New build environment is excellent and staff were helpful and friendly. I waited whilst car was serviced. It was completed on time - serviced, washed and vacuumed. Short film sent to my e mail address of technician examining vehicle and drawing attention to some points. No hesitation in using Inchcape at Preston again."
2018-09-08,5,"The sales man, Bart ,was professional, listened to my requests and was simply brilliant. His product knowledge was outstanding and Nothing was too much trouble for him. From the moment I walked into the showroom and met Bart it was a real pleasure to deal with him. The customer experience and journey to driving away in my new car with Bart handling everything was simple efficient & just world class . Everyone at the showroom offered a level of hospitality and service the goes way above and beyond what you would expect, even with it being Mercedes and the obvious high expectations. I would like to say Bart is a credit to Mercedes and if you are shopping for a new car go see him. The vehicle is stunning and I am so happy I chose Mercedes over other luxury car brands."
2018-09-08,5,Love the car and we were treated very well throughout. Some minor administrative errors in paperwork that were corrected immediately.
2018-09-07,5,"I arranged a visit to my local Inchcape (Norwich) to, hopefully, buy a used mini. All the staff, from the reception staff to the salesman who dealt with my, eventual, purchase made the whole experience smooth and stress free. I have no hesitation in recommending this company."
2018-09-07,5,Bilal was excellent from start to finish. Made buying our new car a pleasure. Highly recommend him and Mercedes Nottingham.
2018-09-07,4,as always very good service from inchcape derby
2018-09-07,5,Brilliant experience from start to finish. The salesman was honest and first class.

2018-09-07,5,Very efficient service and very helpful staff. Would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
2018-09-07,5,First service on my Jag - First Class Service by Inchcape UK.
2018-09-07,1,"I have had my bmw 320d for over a year and have never had any mechanical issues. I needed my protective under carriage panels replaced so I took it to bmw Thames ditton. At first they were really helpful and I was very pleased with their support and service. They had to order in the parts so they booked me in for the following weekend. I turn up, parts not there. I returned the following weekend to have this work completed, only to find that they didn't have all the panels, this resulted in yet another trip to the workshop. After all that a few weeks later my air-conditioning had stopped working. So I go in for an A/C service and refill. Few weeks’ later A/C stops working. Now I need the A/C condenser replaced. Following this repair I drove the car for no more than 10 miles, the drivetrain warning light appeared, indicating yet another problem. After contacting BMW I was advised that they were not able to diagnose the problem immediately and the next available appointment was in 1 month. After complaining to head office about the wait period and no offer of a courtesy car they managed to do it in 2 weeks. I was advised that this is a problem with Air flow sensor and the erg valve. Now having had my car back and driving 50mile an hour on the M25. Cruising at that speed and foot lightly on the accelerator the car decides to cough and splutter until I either take the foot off the pedal or increase my acceleration. I have called the Thames ditton branch and am still waiting for a call back. I am at my wits end with this. Problem after problem since I went in there.

Heres an update... Still have not been called back about my ongoing issues after 3-4 messages to them. I have now resorted to emailing and contacting the head office to keep a paper trail of this insane episode."
2018-09-07,5,"Good friendly service and over the years I have been dealing with Mini Norwich I have grown to trust their workmanship and professional ethic. I will stay with Mini for as long as they maintain their current high standards.

Nice bit of eye candy on the show room floor, possibly a upgrade in the near future."
2018-09-07,5,"Very welcoming staff and excellent and respectful and courteous at all times , the service price was very reasonable as well ."
2018-09-07,5,"Highly recommend , Karen on reception very helpful, also excellent customer service from Stuart ."
2018-09-07,4,"easy booking, great service and good workmanship but oh! when are they going to get sufficient parking?"
2018-09-07,5,"Had a really good experience with Inchcape. Didn’t feel pressured, agreed a deal that I felt was fair and the customer service (Jacinta Milligan) was excellent!

I would definitely recommend this dealership."
2018-09-07,4,Great service and staff. 4 stars and not 5 because if you're gonna advise that a tyre needs replacing then you should have them in stock. Second trip required now.
2018-09-07,5,"First visit to the Showroom,well received at reception and promptly received by member of staff who offered every curtesy in explaining procedures regarding the service and benefits.
Received E.mail re check undertaken and documentation recording the service. Payment made and car duly collected. Excellent!!!
One comment given the new models introduced this year surprised that no member of the sales team made any contact to enquire if one was satisfied with the vehicle,perhaps a potential sales opportunity??"
2018-09-07,5,Very helpful staff who sourced a wheel rim not available in UK quickly. Work was completed on time as agreed for slightly less than I expected
2018-09-07,5,"First class, professional, told me my service would be completed within 2 hrs max. it was finished, cleaned & bought back in 1 & half hrs. All staff very friendly, receptionist, service. Very good"

2018-09-07,5,"Our experience with Inchcape Norwich was excellent, from the start of our enquiry to the collection of our Range Rover Evoque. Keith Richardson explained each detail in great depth, was conscious of our requirements and delivered on everything to make the experience very smooth. Thanks Keith for all your help, much appreciated. Keep up the good work. Bravo!"
2018-09-07,5,Excellent service as normal. Used for years with no problems at all.

2018-09-06,4,"Excellent service,after a slightly dodgy start when I was told the car wouldn’t be ready until 5-5.30,I’d thought it would be 4-4.30(but learned that’s only if the car is in by 8am)- it ended happily with the car ready at 12.30- delighted- every thing clearly explained & the cost exactly as quoted - thank you"
2018-09-06,5,Very impressed with the service from this garage. Many thanks to Phil and all the team. My Class A is like new - I drove it back to France with no sign of the problems which plagued me on the way over.
2018-09-06,5,Superb service from start to finish. Very pleased.
2018-09-06,5,"Our car was just in for an MOT but Inchcape made sure that it was dealt with promptly and well valeted at the end.

They also arranged for a courtesy car to take us into the city and collect us when our car was ready. Friendly, helpful and efficient- thanks guys."
2018-09-06,5,What lovely service. So helpful and friendly. Run like clockwork. Customer service outstanding. Very organised. Thanks so much for helping me . And like to thanks Henry. Very helpful. Very unstand
2018-09-06,3,"Car went in to have some minor cosmetic work done on the front. I had been quoted a price for the work and told that it would take 2 days to complete. A courtesy car was arranged for which I had to pay £15 per day insurance. When I went to collect the car I immediately noticed that one of the paint chips had not been touched up. This was quickly carried out in the car park.
Upon getting home I noticed that the number plate which should have been replaced, due to damage, had also not been renewed.
This required a further visit to complete the work.
Overall I was a little disappointed that the job had not been finished to the standard that you would expect from a prestige motor vehicle garage, especially as it was not cheap."
2018-09-06,4,"I was pleased with the service I received from Lydia Hackney, she kept me informed and was very polite."
2018-09-06,5,"Cheryl was amazing and really made everything so easy.
I absolutely love my new car!"
2018-09-06,5,"Very easy process. My car was collected and I was asked when I would like it returned. I received a call when the service was complete and then to confirm it’s return. I also received a video of the health check by text and email which was a great touch. My car also received a well needed valet. Excellent, thank you!"
2018-09-06,5,"Excellent service , very detailed explanation given about everything . Spot on !!"
2018-09-06,1,"Sadly shocking customer Service

Well I have been invited by Mercedes Derby to review their service which had sadly in my opinion been shocking. All I needed to do was book my car in for a safety recall, I never believed it would be so difficult. I phoned 4 times over multiple days, it was never answered, I left voicemails and the calls weren't returned. (That bit I wasn't that fussed about even thought its pretty poor). I then went into the Showroom and explained I had called and left a message etc myself to a young man on reception, he was totally obnoxious and literally turned his nose up and handed me a form and told me to fill it in. Again I waited a week and never heard back so I went online and this time someone spoke to me, I got a call back and my repair was carried out and the service provided was fine and what to be expected.
So when I got asked for feedback I felt before posting online that I inform them about what I believed was poor service, I received an email saying the site would look into my complaint and two weeks later still again no response (a pattern has emerged).I will be swapping my car next year and I don't think I will be going to Mercedes Derby.

Update 17/09/18

I have since received a call and apology to Mercedes Derby which I am thankful for, they explained calls aren't dealt with onsite and are completed by a call centre elsewhere. The young gentleman doesn't work on reception, he was trying to help and clearly made an error. Sadly though my company has since emailed me as they wanted some more information and quote ""I have tried to call the dealership a few times but get no answer"". There is clearly something fundamentally wrong with their processes and I imagine they must be missing lots of customers."
2018-09-06,5,"Sales person was very friendly, helpful and through with explaining everything to us."
2018-09-06,5,"The experience of buying a car here was trouble free and enjoyable. All the staff I dealt with were friendly, efficient and helpful. Lee Craske was knowledgeable, friendly and put himself out to make the whole process an enjoyable experience. Thank you to everyone concerned. Geoff Dorrie"
2018-09-06,1,Car not prepared or checked. Items missing and very poor after care. Would not use again
2018-09-06,5,Mark was extremely welcoming at BMW Cooper Reading and helped me find a quiet space in the customer lounge to take phone calls whilst I waited for the car to be serviced. The work was completed quicker than expected and the handover was efficient at the end. A great experience.
2018-09-06,2,"I arrived at the allotted time ( 8.30 am ) a time that would have allowed me to get to work on time, for the service on my car and was asked to wait and a service agent would be with me very shortly, she arrived 20 minutes later, took my driving license to arrange a loan car and when she returned about 10 minutes later she took my car keys and gave me the keys to the loan car and told me that it was on the car park somewhere on the front row and left me to find it myself. The car was dirty inside and out with the luggage area covered in dog hair. At 4.35 pm I received a text to say my car would be ready after 5pm so I went to collect it, after struggling to get into the premises because of all the cars randomly parked on the access road and the amount of cars trying to get out of the dealership I finally made it to the car park / display area and eventually found somewhere to park the loan car, I then entered the showroom/ service reception to return the loan car keys and collect my keys, after another wait of 10 minutes the service agent came to me with the bill and my keys, I paid the account and was given my keys and told my car was on the car park. When I found my car I was really disappointed to see that it had been ""washed"" by giving it a quick squirt with a pressure washer and left to dry with the horrible grey water marks all over it, in fact so bad that I had to use the screen wash before driving off. After arriving home I looked in the boot to find that all my personal stuff that had been neatly stored under the boot floor with the spare wheel was now just thrown inside the boot. I am at a loss as to understand how Inchcape staff can think that this level of customer service is acceptable. I have owned and operated Mercedes vehicles, both cars and commercials for the last 25 years and have had issues with Warrington Mercedes before, but decided to give them another chance as they are the nearest Mercedes main dealer, but I am afraid that this will be the last time that any of my vehicles will go to Inchcape. Because of the poor service of the obvious things that I can see, it makes me wonder about the quality of service of the things I can't see."
2018-09-06,5,very pleased with the service i received
2018-09-06,4,Relatively easy experience. However I think that the Service Managers could be a little more friendly. I was sat at the service managers desk for a relatively uncomfortable minute while he sorted out his paper work. Suggest its best not to be sat at their desk until they are ready for you.
2018-09-06,4,They were not always prompt at getting back to me and I had to chase for an answer but apart from that it was all smooth and helpful
2018-09-05,1,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had. Communication from this dealership is non-existent. I made all the phone calls to them to enquire about the car and then subsequent calls to ensure car would be ready for me to collect.

Their Customer service is of the poorest quality. Whole experience from day one to the day when I was supposed to collect the car turned out to be a nightmare. I was bounced between four different sales executives and none of them took any responsibility to get the car prepared as had been agreed. On the day when I was supposed to collect the car, I found the car to be in the same state as I had left it a week before when I paid the deposit to reserve the car. Car was still dirty from inside and none of the agreed work had been done. I had to cancel the deal. No explanation given as to why the car had not been prepared.

Despite the fact that dealership had failed to provide the service they had promised, it still took them another 7 days to return my deposit. Apparently they do not hand over the cars to customers at weekends. I had to take a day off work to travel from Scotland to collect the car. Since car was not in a suitable condition for me to take, I had to travel back via train. Initially the dealership refused to reimburse me for train fare. Eventually on my insistence, they capitulated and agreed to reimburse. It is over 3 weeks now and I am still waiting for that to happen.

Overall, my experience has been of disappointment, anguish, non-existent communication and extremely poor service. I have never encountered such service from any car dealership before. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP."
2018-09-05,5,The most chilled car service ever!
2018-09-05,5,"Professional and efficient service, thank you!"
2018-09-05,5,Great service from booking through to receiving my car back. Everyone I dealt with was friendly and helpful. Everything was explained to me thoroughly and a problem I sent the car in with was resolved.
2018-09-05,5,"Excellent service from booking to check in and collection. Very efficient courteous welcoming staff.. Facilities in the showroom for “waiting” are first class, as one would expect from BMW dealers. Thank you."

Thank you Josh Willis and Glen; You are a star!"
2018-09-05,2,Strange experience at Coopers BMW. Started well with used car salesman showing me cars. Then decided to buy one and called them the following day. Got through 3 times to reception and no one called me back. Called again a few days later as I had hoped price may drop. Still no one called me back. Called again a few days after that as I wanted a specific car and after two attempts got through to someone and bought the car immediately. It was like no one actually wanted to answer the phone or sell any cars! Very Strange
2018-09-05,5,"All the guys were excellent. Professional, thorough, helpful and friendly. Really pleased with my deal and my new car."
2018-09-05,5,"Made me feel special, great customer service, and an enjoyable experience buying my new car."
2018-09-05,5,"Great service from Simon and Richard. Excellent product knowledge.

Picked up my new Velar yesterday. Very accommodating, picked up after work and Simon stayed late especially.
Would definitely recommend this friendly dealership."
2018-09-05,5,"First class care and attention from the second I called up to the three days later when I collected my new mini. cannot praise highly enough the care and attention from our 'salesman' Asif Ansari. So helpful and obliging and not at all pushy. Went the extra mile to arrange test drives for us even coming in on his day off. Love the car, happy with the price and delighted with the service from Croydon Cooper Mini"
2018-09-05,1,"The worst customer service from a main dealer have ever experienced. Rude and disinterested staff. Telling me to drive car away without any insurance, seriously shocking. Back street dealer at best!!"
2018-09-05,5,"Simon Allen was really helpful all the way through the process. He turned the vehicle around inside 7 days, which was amazing! I would highly recommend to anyone!"
2018-09-05,4,"Service carried out. Had a couple of warranty items completed as well.
All done efficiently and vehicle valeted before collection"
2018-09-05,5,"Excellent service from the service department and the young man who collected the car.
Keep up the good work Cooper."
2018-09-04,5,"Excellent service, helpful and a straightforward car buying experience."
2018-09-04,5,Excellent service
2018-09-04,5,Service advisor was excellent from start to finish.
2018-09-04,5,"My car was booked in for a routine scheduled service at Inchcape Coventry. The cost was fair given that the car will have evidence of a full Mercedes quality history when the time comes to part exchange. This fact alone probably makes the service invoice price free of charge! An equivalent courtesy car is provided, and the Mercedes equivalent of RAC / AA rescue is maintained along with the 3 year Warranty. The treatment I recieved from the service department was cheerful and competent, with nothing on the car ""replaced"" which did not need replacing ... so for example I'm good to drive for the third year on the original (factory) brake pads / discs!"
2018-09-04,1,"Horrendous parking facilities for an ealledged professional company.

I will point out a member of staff was asked where to park and to be told to double park wasn’t the answer when you actually care about other people and your own vehicle."
2018-09-04,5,"From start of process, booking a test drive in a BMW to final purchase Inchcape staff were extremely professional and helpful. In particular the salesman was in no way pushy and allowed us time to consider all options.
The ability to drive the car on our own, in order to get a real feel for it was much appreciated. There were no time constraints and during the more mundane procedures of signing things off we were plied with excellent coffee.
The car itself is wonderful- just what we wanted with all fixtures and fittings as requested."
2018-09-04,5,"I recently had the pleasure of buying my first VW Golf GTD from the lovely Mahmoud at Cheltenham Inchcape. I was greeted by the friendly staff on the front desk, whom offered me refreshments and somewhere comfortable to sit.

I was then greeted by the pleasant and helpful Mahmoud. I was then shown in detail the availabile cars that met my specific needs. I was blown away by Mahmoud’s extensive product knowledge.


I was made to feel at home and comfortable at all times which I have certainly it experienced with other car dealerships.

I will definitely be recommending inchcape to my friends and family.

Thank you to Mahmoud and the team for going above and beyond."
2018-09-04,3,I had booked the car in for an Mot after being told it did not need a service I arrived to be told that the car also needed a brake fluid Chang’s and after that concluded that the car in fact was due a major service. I am now faced with booking it in at a later date I do not understand the Audi service schedules that’s why I take it to the main dealers to look after it I do not expect confusion
2018-09-04,5,Very easy and straightforward from start to finish. Had my car serviced by the team lead by Steve.
2018-09-04,5,Excellent service from reception to completion. Who could ask for more. Big plus the maintenance work was first class problem resolved.
2018-09-04,4,Generally very good experience however on collecting the car it was stuck behind the barrier and looked like it had been washed in a hurry. Steve the service chap was very good.
2018-09-04,5,Turned up early but was attended to straight away. Received call to confirm all work complete and car was ready earlier than requested. Pleasant staff who explained all aspects of work. Very happy
2018-09-04,5,Fantastic service
2018-09-04,5,"Efficient, polite and on time"
2018-09-04,5,"We bought an NX300 Premier with 4500miles on it for my wife. It took 5 days start to finish. Seriously impressed with the service we got from Gary at Lexus Guildford. Nothing was too much trouble and the communication was spot on, and what a spectacular car! I’d recommend Lexus and Guildford to everybody. (I’m planning to go back for an LC!) First class experience which I really enjoyed"
2018-09-04,5,Excellent service and flexibility - the team provided options to have tyres replaced a the same time as my service which saved me time and money - the team at Audi Stockport are always friendly and welcoming and a pleasure to deal with.
2018-09-04,5,"Rob, the Sales Executive at Mercedes Coventry was most helpful, friendly and easy to deal with."
2018-09-04,5,"Excellent service, staff are so helpful and nice."
2018-09-03,5,Attention to detail excellent from start to finish great customer service what you would expect when paying above average service costs well recommended very efficient and professional service.
2018-09-03,2,"My car had to go in after a safety recall. It was booked in for 11.30, advised it would take 40 minutes, no longer than an hour so advised I would wait. I arrived at 11.20 with my son, no one had came to see me by 11.50, I had to ask what was happening. I then signed my car over, told again no longer than an hour. My car wasn't ready until 2.50!! I was disappointed at the customer service, no one was coming to see me to advise of the delay. I was then rushed out with no paperwork to say what work had been done. Disappointing. It took the best part of my day off work."
2018-09-03,5,"Mercedes Derby were excellent
I was very impressed with the salesmen who was professional without being overly 'pushy'"
2018-09-03,1,"- Recall disaster
- Arrived @ 8am and greeted by a non smiley receptionist and told to just wait.
- had 2 Mercedes booked for recall and was seen by 2 different people with a huge delay in between - had to sign for paperwork with no explanation as to why
- eventually found a courtesy car after walking around the forecourt several times with 2nd assistant who advised the car the 1st assistant was looking for did not exist - approx 40 mins after arrival
- advised both assistants we would collect both cars at 4.30. Was advised they don’t take long they will be ready to collect sooner
- arrived at 4.30 and greeted by another non smiley receptionist and again told to wait
- waited in the waiting area and advised by 1st assistant one car was ready however 2nd car was still in the workshop, however both cars were on the forecourt where we originally parked them
- after 30 mins we asked assistant 2 who advised cars had been seen and would be ready any minute
- witnessed both cars being taken into the workshop soon after to commence work as it was clear neither had been started
- a further 30 mins later advised cars would not be long
- eventually after over 1 hr waiting both cars were ready with no explanation as to what had been done
All in all a very poor service from what is considered a prestige product"
2018-09-03,5,A first class service with excellent communication. The team were a pleasure to deal with.
2018-09-03,5,Our car buying experience was exceptional from start to finish.
2018-09-03,5,Excellent service from start to finish. I cant really fault the M6 car I bought although being critical is in my nature. I even discovered that the next service is free since the previous owner purchased services from new. Highly recommend to others and coming from someone who changes cars more often than a girl changes clothes.....ok not quite that often....
2018-09-03,3,"BMW 118i. Your experience will vary depending on who you deal with, but my requests were hit and miss. Nobody seems to care that much, seems that ""well you can always get that done next time you come"" kind of attitude to forgetting service intervals that the car is asking for but not done.
Only using them to get the stamp in the book, if it wasn't for that I wouldn't touch them. Had similar experiences with my Mini."
2018-09-03,5,"Superb service from the team at MBCO, particularly Tony and Ross. A very efficient and hassle free experience and I fully recommend them to all."
2018-09-03,5,Really helpful and knowledgable about the product. Arranged everything quickly and efficiently.
2018-09-03,5,Bought a second hand car very professional looked after me from start to finish.
2018-09-03,5,"My purchase went really well and was greatly assisted by the professional help of the used car sales team especially Grant who was consistently helpful.
I don't normally complete this type survey request but I have to say that i seriously felt a good Mercedes customer service vibe during the whole purchase process and now I look forward to continued good levels of service and many miles of hassle free motoring."
2018-09-03,5,"Many thanks for the experience of this service,
It wasn’t 100% but it was 100% better than before when I came for other things.
Hopefully when I have to come back it will be 100%.
Thanks again"
2018-09-03,5,"Second service at Inchcape Guildford
Good service , good communication, on time and did all that was asked. The valet was great as well."
2018-09-03,1,"PLEASE do don't trust the cow boys at Cooper Chelmsford with your car. The service ""technicians"" are terrible - can't diagnose faults and when they do eventually fix one problem you end up with another problem. Even if your BMW / Mini is under warranty - just go somewhere else."
2018-09-03,5,service on time from start to completion.Staff competent and friendly.Car very clean inside and out when service complete.
2018-09-03,5,Bought a Discovery Sport nearly new. Very good service though out - clear explanation of how the car worked and operated. Good car buying experience.
2018-09-03,4,"I had a good experience buying from Cooper BMW in Reading. After a first enquiry online before pictures were available, Matt was very helpful in providing me with videos to take me around the car. When I came into the dealership for a test drive and to complete the purchase, Russ was very helpful and it was a pleasure in dealing with him. Not pushy in the slightest which I always find a problem in main dealers. The dealership itself is very tidy, well laid out and just a nice environment.

The only reason this wasn't a 5* experience was my disappointment at the level of valet and finish when the car was handed over to me. No effort seems to have been made to remove some of the more obvious scratching to the paintwork and some noticeable stone chips had been missed during the touch up. Whilst I don't expect a used car to be in perfect cosmetic condition, I would expect a main BMW dealership to spend 20 minutes running a machine polisher over any major scratching on bodywork. Its a small thing, but does make a difference to a customer picking the keys up for the first time."
2018-09-03,5,"A very pleasant buying experience - it's a great, friendly team at 'Cooper Ipswich Mini' from the sales staff to the driver who dropped my new mini off at my home.

Unlike several other mini dealers who I had dealings with, they actually wanted my business and were very helpful.

Prices of approved used minis seem to vary greatly between mini dealers for similar spec cars and I feel that I got a good deal from Cooper Ipswich Mini as well.

I'll be going back there again for the next mini inspite of having to travel to Ipswich from North London to do so."
2018-09-03,5,"Excellent all round experience, Lovely atmosphere, went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied with my service! my car was cleaned afterwards which was great, team were accommodating and it was a quick and painless process, further onto this, the view of all of the beautiful new BMW's was lovely!"
2018-09-03,5,Excellent again - always excellent.
2018-09-03,4,just a long wait . thought salesman i had purchased from would have taken opportunity to engage in conversation re next exchange . surprised !
2018-09-03,5,Excellent service. Treated like royalty! A huge thanks to Grant who looked after us so well
2018-09-03,5,Great customer service. Well communicated throughout
2018-09-03,5,"Excellent experience, dropped car off, staff were very friendly and helpful. Received car back cleaned and looking great. Could fault any aspect of this dealership. Will definitely be returning."
2018-09-03,3,"Uninspiring Customer service
Not helped by IT issues, and a lack of staff at a senior level to deal with price discussions.
Pressure to complete before month end, but no financial incentive to do so, so more interested in their numbers rather than ours...
They spent more time telling us we had to have a HP quote as a requirement of the FSA, even though we had already said we would pay cash. Then spent even more time in selling extended warranty, GAP insurance and paint protection than anything else.
It was summed up by the classic line ""My next appointment have booked a test drive of this car as well, so if you don't commit now....""

30 minute car drive followed by 2 hours sitting at the dealership waiting for them to resolve IT issues and 1 Senior staff member who keep wandering away......."
2018-09-03,5,"James Steer could not have been more helpful, also Elaine in call centre when booking MOT and service"
2018-09-03,5,Great customer service 5*
2018-09-03,5,Excellent service and no delays.
2018-09-03,4,"Dealt with efficiently and in a courteous manner, however worth a mention of poor parking on site, staff did not have much knowledge on Mercedes Me App and although my car was parked close to the exit there was no mention of where it was following completion. But comfortable surroundings and refreshments were readily available."
2018-09-03,1,"Another exceptionally poor customer service experience at Tunbridge Wells Audi this morning. Sat in the waiting area of the service department for over 20 minutes whilst being ignored by 5 members of staff too busy talking amongst themselves. When I spoke up and asked to speak to the service manager I was instead served by 'Tiana'. After I explained the situation and mentioned this was a regular occurrence here, I was given an apology but told it was my fault for not 'checking in' and that staff hadn't noticed I was there. 3 staff sitting at desks facing you and they don't notice you, are they serious! When you first arrive you are greeted with a desk facing the wrong way with staff usually preoccupied amongst themselves to even notice you and no signage to say where you must report to. If you are lucky enough to be noticed and 'check in' you then head for a seating area facing the service desks where you wait to be noticed by the service staff.
You only have to read their online reviews to realise this is a frequent occurrence, and I have witnessed first hand customers complaining at staff on more than one occasion. Its only a shame they can't be bothered to read the feedback themselves and act on it. Either be prepared for a shocking lesson in customer service or go elsewhere. Nothing has changed in the years we have been using this centre and this will definitely be our last visit!"
2018-09-03,5,"Flawless experience from selecting a car and taking delivery. Howard took me through the selection of my vehicle explaining what was best for my requirements and taking me on test drives. Wayne gave me the delivery demonstration of the vehicles operating instructions and all the extras that the car had and how to work them.
Both were Exceptional"
2018-09-02,5,"Excellent service, very professional and friendly team. Indy, the Sales Exec and the rest of the sales team was very helpful throughout. Would highly recommend Inchcape Peasmarsh."
2018-09-02,4,The salesman who was dealing with me was very good. The site was very busy and there seem to be a lot going on. There was only one card machine and it took the salesman a little time to locate it. On the whole the service I received was very good.
2018-09-02,5,"There are sales personnel and then there is Adrian - Top Man !!!
My husband and myself were introduced to Adrian when we expressed an interest in a Q5 at Audi Macclesfield.
We immediately felt welcomed and relaxed in his polite and friendly company as we spoke of our requirements over a coffee [thanks receptionists].
He guided us through the relevant stages of part x/purchase in a knowledgeable and professional manner. Everything was explained in a simple manner - no jargon or 'pushy' sales talk. He gave us time to consider and discuss when needed. He truly is a credit to the Audi team.
His recommendation of a local restaurant was welcomed and enjoyed, he made a follow up phone call to ensure all was ok and encouraged us to call if there were any questions we had.
A wonderful experience - Thanks Adrian and team of Audi Macclesfield"
2018-09-01,5,"We travelled from the West Midlands to Mercedes Benz in Llandudno Junction to look at a car.
Huw Evans and Bryn from the sales team were exceptional.
Excellent customer service and advice, we felt confident and assured and are extremely happy with our purchase and experience."
2018-09-01,5,"No problems at the garage bought a second hand car in July. Every thing was straightforward.
Lauren saw to our requirements. Even taking us to a quiet place to test drive the car.
Doubt I would buy another car from that garage as I live almost 150 miles away.
Having said that the delivery and after sales service have been great.
The car was the one I was looking for at the right price. Lovely garage surroundings."
2018-09-01,5,Jon Taylor was our sales person and he was excellent. He spent ages explained how ever thing worked. All the staff we had contact with helpful pleasant and polite.
2018-09-01,5,"Polite and helpful staff from reception through to service assistants and even the drivers who drove courtesy car to the front door and checked over with me to ensure no damage prior to handing over. Courtesy car way beyond expectations, 530 Touring with all bells and whistles.
Throughout the day received several texts to update me on what was happening with my car, when in workshop and when service had been completed.
Full report of service conducted and showing any parts used/replaced, and car washed and hoovered prior to handover.
Such good service throughout, and only issue was having to return the courtesy car at the end of the day."
2018-09-01,5,"Dean at Malton BMW was great to deal with. I loved the personal touch by putting the car in the delivery lounge area. It is a nice touch.
I never felt pressured to rush the deal. The car was immaculate.
Would recommend them if youre looking for a new or used BMW"
2018-09-01,5,Excellent service would use again.
2018-09-01,5,I recently booked my car in for a service. My car was collected and returned on time and the Mercedes staff were courteous and polite. They spent time with me explaining what work was scheduled and how long it would take. I would not hesitate in recommending them.
2018-08-31,1,"I thought I’d tell you about my experience with Mini Malton

The Brand leader is called Chris Goodwin: His manager is apparently called Craig something

I agreed to buy a car. It took 2 weeks to get a used car ready...... why I don’t know!
When we arrived to collect it the money hadn’t arrived from the finance company so I paid cash for the car (20,500) on the strict understanding when the finance money arrived it would be forwarded to me immediately.

I called Tuesday 28th aug and was told that the money from the finance company was in and it would be sent to me that day. I asked for as same day, Chris agreed

I rang every day, he kept saying he was doing everything he could.

By Friday I was angry, I asked him to confirm when the money was sent and how, he then admitted he had been lying and that despite the fact that you had been paid twice for the same car he hadn’t issued the refund as his boss wouldn’t authorize it.

He said it was more than his job was worth to refund me even though he had told me many many times the refund had already been done and he admitted you had the money twice.

I spoke to his boss, Craig or Owen who admitted that I had been deceived, admitted that the money had been received but not sent to me and said he would refund it immediately. He couldn’t explain (he said) why I had been lied to. He admitted that the actions of Chis Goodwin were close to fraudulent and admitted that I would be within my rights to speak to the Police Fraud Team

Then he told me that he had to refund it the same way it had been paid: via a debit card refund rather than a same day BACS or TT. I told him that was rubbish, the bank confirmed it was rubbish, the finance company confirmed it was rubbish. But that’s what he did.

Then I revealed to him that some of the money I had paid had come from my wife’s credit card (5,000) and the balance on my debit card, proving that again I was being lied to, as he did the refund was done entirely on my debit card!

I am disgusted at my 20,500 being deliberately withheld. From my experience the staff are liars!

I asked for their boss to call me. He didn’t, so I hope this serves in some way to lose them business. It’s all they deserve.

As I type this I have had my car exactly 2 weeks, they have been paid for the car for twice for 2 weeks and I still don't know where my money is. No one at Cooper will help me. I don't know what to do.

I think the only solution is for me to speak to the police and report a fraud!"
2018-08-31,4,"George was very helpful talking me through the service and booking my car in again as the electric windows stick a bit and they ran out of time. This was the first service on my mini.
Would have been five stars but the service warning light is still on saying the oil needs changing- but it’s been done- I hope!
The lady on reception was very courteous and made me a nice coffee."
2018-08-31,3,"Booked a courtesy car for a service, but they had allocated all their cars, so no car and waiting around for 2 hours.
So all sorted, but only another £700 for brake pads and discs - so either incredibly poor value for money or a license to print money, you decide !!"
2018-08-31,5,"quick fast efficient service, didn't have to wait as long as expected."
2018-08-31,5,Great service. My first time using Inchcape and very pleased they are my local VW dealer.
2018-08-31,5,Excellent service from initial interest to car being delivered to door. Great feedback to all questions - no matter how minor and a great deal. No hassle very easy at every step. Very happy.
2018-08-31,5,"My experience was faultless. Excellent showroom. Polite, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable staff. No pressure selling. I secured a great car and part exchanged my old one without issue."
2018-08-31,5,"Fantastic Service from Tim, friendly reception, Car thoroughly cleaned."
2018-08-31,5,Service and MOT carried out without any fuss. Courtesy car as planned. Always obliging staff.
2018-08-31,3,"My service was fine, I was quite surprised what recommended work was flagged up, for a vehicle less than a year old I wouldn't have imagined I would have needed to replace my windscreen wipers.

I was also not very impressed with the valet of the car unfortunately, the boot didn't even look like it had been hoovered.

The lady who I dealt with however was very helpful.

Apart from that the customer service was fine and prompt.

thanks"
2018-08-31,4,"Marie was extremely helpful in my purchase as this was a big deal for me buying my dream car. I was disappointed that when I went to my appointment to view the car that it hadn’t been cleaned. And when I was due to pick it up a week later I had a call an hour and a half before to tell me it wasn’t ready which was very upsetting as I’d been excited all week! However, Marie personally delivered the car to me later that day and finalised the transaction at my home. I love my new car but did notice a small dent in the bonnet which I wasn’t made aware of."
2018-08-31,5,"Marco was brilliant and gave us lots of information regarding our purchase, we found him friendly and helpful and it was a pleasure purchasing our car. We would definitely recommend to friends! Thank you!"
2018-08-31,5,"I bought my Mercedes C220 2014 on August 24 2018 and I am very pleased with the all round experience from the word go there is an air of professional and quality service,Curtis the salesman was both friendly and helpful . Very pleased that I chose to buy a Mercedes,and from Inchcape Warrington. Only thing is now my wife wants me to buy her one from here . Many thanks"
2018-08-31,4,"A little slow in procuring the car I wanted to buy but great, responsive and friendly service from the salesman otherwise."
2018-08-31,2,"Service not completed as car is too old.
Staff explained why service not carried out and where able to quote ridiculous price for replacing a £50 part.
Everyone very polite but as I’m finding with JLR lately they treat you like you have a blank cheque to give them, you do not get good value from this high end product.
Car not cleaned propelry when handed back either."
2018-08-30,5,"Fantastic experience
Just purchased a used Jaguar from Inchcape in Preston. From start to finish the experience was fantastic. Think we got a great deal and the best bit was when we came to collect the vehicle. We were taken to a private booth where the car had been brought indoors so we could check it over out of the rain. The car had been made over and looked amazing and also had a brand new set of tyres. Big thanks to Sarah who sorted everything out and called back after a few days to check we were happy with everything. Can't recommend this place enough."
2018-08-30,5,"The service and attention from Stewart Rowbotham was excellent in every respect. A totally pleasant transaction.
Special mention to Alex - his coffee snacks and attention was much appreciated 😀"
2018-08-30,4,"Good service, Thank You."
2018-08-30,1,"Very bad experience I brought a car paid more then the price i was showen realised when I got home. I have nothing but problems with the car I have only had it for 2days I was put right and left now i am stuck with a £13,262 + £990 for extra warranty so total £14,252 car and today is my brithday spent the whole day trying to sort it out to change it i go to pay on top of the price well done great service

Can some one help me with the maths because I think I can't add up £8000 cash £6200 for my px and £250 deposit is that not more then I was told 14,450 so not only they took my deposit never took it off the price.

The list of this wrong on purches :
The roof from the inside tottaly discussting looks like some one has been sick on it .

The brakes screch
When I drive there is a winding noise on the left
There is a dent in the bonit
The passenger head light is fallen down peeled the paint.
The wheel barring is make noise
The spring is rusted
The cars screch back door
The left mirrors motor is vibrating
It hardly runs on hybrid
When I drive the brakes scrape on the pads
Pick up sooooooo slow
Yet I keep the car is been 2 days

Actually I was told they would fix it but I had to drive 100miles from my home to drop the car then go pick it up and they were not going to pay my cost of fuel even so I got the car with the problem and to make it a even better experience I seen another car they want me to pay another £500 to have that car ? Why should I pay I refused to pay this is the 4th day don't give me rubbish I said I come to if thease instoe staff don't fix it let's see what happens"
2018-08-30,1,"AVOID MERCEDES LEICESTER AT ALL COSTS. Bought an almost new 3 month old A Class 250 AMG, (FD18 BTY), only for it to break down 60 miles later after collection. After 6 hours on the services and no help from Leicester, Mercedes RAC recovered the vehicle and took it to my local dealership for investigation. I was informed a few days later that I had put the wrong fuel in the car. I told the garage that I hadn't even filled it up but Leicester Mercedes where saying that they hadn't done anything to the car from me test driving it and that it was me and not them. I then complained to Mercedes nationally, knowing I could prove it wasn't me from camera footage. Later that day Leicester eventually admitted it was them and said they would repair the vehicle. I informed them on multiple occasions that I didn't want to proceed with the purchase as this was no longer the car I purchased. I took advice from a mechanic who said that I could have problems with it down the line even after an engine flush. I eventually got my money back 4 days later than was originally promised after numerous excuses. Now it appears that the A class registration documents have been sent to the wrong address, although I informed Leicester when purchasing the vehicle that the address was incorrect and asked them to change it. Obviously they ignored me or didn't care as long as they got a sale. Now they have resold the vehicle they are now ringing and texting me constantly telling me to find the registration document and have said that if I don't find the document and something happens in the vehicle with the new owner it will come back on me as I am down as the registered keeper. Beggers belief! Due to stress, I have now blocked all calls and text messaging from them and will be forwarding another complaint to Mercedes National and also trading standards. I can't believe that Mercedes, as a brand, allow dealerships to operate like this?
On a plus note, Bolton Mercedes (Marshalls dealership) have been brilliant, but I would definitely advise staying away from an inchcape dealer."
2018-08-30,2,"I had to wait quite a long time for a servicing appointment due to all the recalls. When I received my car back there was quite a lot of blue biro on my oyster coloured car door, which wasn’t there when I dropped it off. I’m guessing a technician had a pen in their pocket whilst dealing with the car. I therefore had to waste another half day driving it back to BMW to get it removed which was exceedingly annoying. The servicing rep was really helpful and did his best to sort it but for the exorbitant price BMW charges for their servicing, this was extremely disappointing."
2018-08-30,4,Matthew Cooper was superbly helpful in organising MOT. Excellent interpersonal skills.
2018-08-30,5,I found the service was excellent when I had my service.
2018-08-30,5,"John Hill from Fulwood was extremely helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. He showed me everything about the car in full, offered to bring round another car to compare. He was not pushy. When i get chance i will be going back again to have another lesson with the controls! John said come in anytime it would be no problem. His after care was very considerate and to telephone him regarding the smallest thing. Excellent 5 *. Highly recommend"
2018-08-29,5,"Fantastic service at Mercedes Benz, Coventry and really pleasant and friendly staff. I wasn't kept waiting and was given a lovely car for the duration of the day whilst my car was serviced. A great cup of tea too, thank you!"
2018-08-29,5,"I made arrangements with Steve Booth for the MOT, service and a lift into the town centre and back. My wife has mobility problems and I had just broken my toe the morning the service was due. I wanted to wait at the garage since walking was painful for me. Steve explained that the service was arranged for 2.30 pick up at the town centre. However he was able to get the MOT and service done earlier. Completed at 11.00. The only snag was that not everyone knew about 12.30 pick up at the back of Argos even we told the driver that we would like him to collect us at 12.30. We had to wait a while, after I phoned the service department, until Jason was dispatched to collect us. Other than that all went well and I am pleased with the service."
2018-08-29,5,Great reliable service time after time
2018-08-29,5,"Professional from start to finish.
Spoke a number of times with one of the sales people, and he organised everything for me (from Ireland).
Got to the sales room at 13:00 and was out by 14:00.
Car was in perfect order, cleaned to within an inch of its life."
2018-08-29,3,"I've used Inchcape (BMW Teesside) for several years now and have generally been more than satisfied with their service. However, on this occasion their service was OK (I did get the use of a loan car) but I can't help feeling a little disappointed.

I received a call from Inchcape to suggest I booked my car in for an end of warranty check, which was timely as, both the MOT and brake service were due (I also agreed to have the aircon recharged). During the call I also explained to the rep that their was fault showing on the automatic headlamp adjustment which would need looking at under the warranty.

I dropped the car off at 8.30am and was initially told it would be ready for approx. 2pm. A later call told me the car would be ready for 4pm and then a further call to say it would be 5pm. I went to collect the car at 5pm and was told that the brakes discs/pads had been changed, the aircon recharged and the MOT completed. However, the fault on the headlamp had not been corrected due to insufficient time! I have now had to rebook the car in again in three weeks time.

My disappoint is from the fact that they had the car all day, and although they were notified about the headlamp fault at the time of booking, (and perhaps I'm being a bit synical), all the work that was chargeable was completed, but the warranty work was not."
2018-08-29,5,"I've brought my car here for it's last x2 services.
The service technicians and customer care here are far superior to any I have used before."
2018-08-29,5,"1st class services all round 11 out of 10
Lauren , Michelle and team were fantastic I could not ask for more well done.
best regards
Will Holmes"
2018-08-29,5,"Great Service. MOT, service and air conditioner. Received telephone confirmation of date booked day before due. Picked up on time by very courteous driver. Received video of car along with a call to advise MOT passed and service completed, but one additional item was needed. This item had been flagged on a previous visit and I had missed it when booking the car in. Received a call to say vehicle ready and payment taken.
Car returned to my home, again with a very friendly and courteous driver.
I was informed of the costs prior to confirming the booking and am completely satisfied."
2018-08-29,5,Very good service from the moment you enter the building
2018-08-29,5,Fast efficient pleasant service at oldham branch. Carl Fraser sales dealt with us...
2018-08-29,5,Great service and great cars
2018-08-29,1,The car was in for it's first service. It came out with a nasty dint near the petrol filler cap and as I drove off the service warning light came on again. Really poor experience
2018-08-29,5,"Very helpful, knowledgeable staff at Guildford Peasmarsh site - especially Lily who helped along every step of our purchase ."
2018-08-29,1,"Whilst the work done (repair of puncture on 15.08.2018) was no doubt of the usual high Mini standard, the visual health check report was appalling.
The lid of the engine coolant was left off, resulting in the engine overheating which could have been catastrophic."
2018-08-29,1,"Decided to go to the 'experts' with a possible issue but sadly they were not really interested or hadn't got the skill levels. Kept the car all day and didn't phone me as promise - I had to call them twice. Small local garage resolved the issue (MAP sensor) at a very reasonable cost. Evans only seem interested in selling vehicles and dealing with warranty matters. When it comes to helping owners with vehicles out of warranty (especially if Evans didn't sell them in the first place), in my opinion they let the Mercedes brand down."
2018-08-29,2,"Booked a ""Fastlane"" simple oil service. Should take ""within 90 minutes"". Took over 2 hours. Car would be cleaned as a courtesy; it was - but only on the outside, maybe I take this for granted with Audi but I expected better from BMW. However, worst is to be told there is a problem with a fog light and put £145 as a quote to fix. Then advised to book in another day. So, on checking at home I find the fog light is fine, it's just that a simple plug has not been connected (I fixed this in 4 minutes). So it was either not connected when sold to me by Cooper Reading which means their pre-sales checks are inadequate or it was done as part of the service. I hope it was the former."
2018-08-28,4,"Zoe Carr at Mercedes Inchcape Oxford did a great job to facilitate us buying a new GLE 350. No part exchange so v straight forward. She did all the work but we never actually met the managers who were too removed and it felt were too aloof to actually meet a grubby customer. However Zoe did the job and was very helpful , Thanks to Zoe."
2018-08-28,5,The level of knowledge of customer assistance we have received from Lauren at Inchcape in Nottingham has been at the highest level - we are delighted with our new car and would definitely recommend.
2018-08-28,5,"I just wanted to thank you again for your help with buying my Q5, particularly Peter who dealt with everything from the test drives to the handover, everything was faultless. The whole experience was really enjoyable, informative and I am absolutely chuffed to bits with my car too. I really appreciate the extra time Peter took to explain the features of the car, answer any questions I had on email and the overall great customer service. He is certainly a credit to Audi and Inchcape. The car reveal was brilliant and really added to the experience."
2018-08-28,1,"At Inchcape Leicester, everytime I have tried to call no one seems to answer the phone. This morning it took around 10 attempts before I got through. When I dropped my car off for a service, the receptionist was grumpy and I got the impression that she was doing me a favour by taking my keys off me. This isn't the first time this has happened to me and I am sure it won't be the last.

They don't seem to care as you just have to look at some of the reviews on google and they seem to be making the same mistakes over and over again.

Some advice for Inchcape MB Leicester:
1. Try answering your phones.
2. Get your receptionist to smile and make people welcome in your dealership - you are after all a MB Main Dealer.

My previous car was a BMW. Everytime I went to the main BMW dealer in Leicester, their staff their made you feel really welcome and answered their phones."
2018-08-28,5,"Very helpful, efficient sales staff during purchase, and support staff for servicing.
Would definitely recommend to family and colleagues
Thank you"
2018-08-28,5,Very polite customer service and car returned fully serviced and cleaned. After 5 years of using this dealership I have no complaints at all from this or any other visit.
2018-08-28,5,"Found us the car we were looking for. had to wait a couple of weeks to get delivery, partly due to us being away on holiday and the car needing to be delivered from another dealer.
mileage was a little higher than the original details (+700m) which was a bit annoying, as it was part of the PCP agreement.
overall very friendly staff, however, the car we were getting was a PHEV, which they didn't seem to have a lot of experience with."
2018-08-28,2,"Bang average-to-poor experience. I paid extra to lease a car for the day whilst my service took place. The 1.5L B Class I got for the day was awful. If you want to entice customers to buy Mercedes again, lease them a decent vehicle.
Also, despite having my car all day, I got it back dirtier than it was when I dropped it off. How do you get mud on the windows when servicing a car? The Mercedes rep said 'Sorry, I've just gone to get your car and it hasn't been cleaned. I don't know why.' So the 'free' car clean as part of a very expensive Service wasn't done, the only instant benefit of going direct to Mercedes for a service.
I'll be going third party for my next service, and probably elsewhere with my next car too."
2018-08-27,5,"We went into Inchcape with only a very rough idea of what we wanted.
We were gently guided by Kelvin to the available vehicles that would meet our base requirements.
The one we selected was probably a higher spec than we considered but
it fitted our requirements very closely.
We are very satisfied with the way the sale was handled and the assistance given."
2018-08-27,5,Had my S5 serviced at Tetubry Audi this week. Great customer service. Professional and knowledgeable staff. Simon from service was excellent and answered all my questions to my satisfaction. My local Audi dealership have fallen short of my expectations so I decided to try Tetbury despite not being local to me. Great decision and I'll definitely make the effort to build a relationship. Can't fault them so far and I recommend them.
2018-08-27,5,"I visited Mercedes Benz Nottingham today for a service of my car. Everything was explained that was going to be carried out and at what time with an estimate of time to be taken.
Super fast service, car washed and hoovered.
All in-depth paperwork of everything carried out.
Lovely place to sit and enjoy a tea or coffee or browse round the showroom at some amazing cars."
2018-08-27,5,Great service. Had some recent issues with Cooper but this occasion went very smoothly.
2018-08-27,5,"Fantastic service from start to finish! Nothing was too much trouble... Lee our salesman was extremely knowledgeable,helpful and informative without the pushy sales speak! A real pleasure to do business with!! The mini I’ve bought is just fantastic it literally took my breath away when I went to collect it, the shine was phenomenal and looked like a brand new car inside and out instead of a 2013 model .. I can’t rate this garage highly enough would definitely recommend and use again in a heartbeat!"
2018-08-27,5,"First time we have bought from Inchcape Chester.
We received excellent service. Andrew Haynes `& Steve Pike both did an excellent job.

Thanks guys, much better than previous dealings with Landrover."
2018-08-27,5,"very helpful staff , had exactly the car I was looking for and I walked out with a new car. I couldn`t ask for any more"
2018-08-27,1,"Courtesy car booked 35 days in advance was not available, service advisor could not give a toss about what logistical issues that caused for me - I have never been so close to a 'computer says no' situation, left me seething. I didn't buy a BMW with the expectation to get rubbish customer service.

Needless to say he could not care about the issue with my car either, was only keen to charge me for wheel alignment checks at a cost £250 - blatant rip off - when I had already checked it elsewhere for a fraction of the cost which had identified a worn bearing issue - service advisor put that down to 'I must have hit a pothole'. No, I hadn't. Its just another tactic to blame the customer for weight saving suspension materials not being up to the job (the car is still within warranty).

I won't buy another BMW as this dealership is as terrible as the others in west London area."
2018-08-27,5,"My first Mercedes purchase and my expectations were exceeded. Friendly reception staff and a very dedicated sales person - Sophie Ward. Sophie was informative, friendly and left no questions unanswered. Nothing was too much trouble. Everything was settled in a couple of hours including test drive and I picked up my car just 4 days later. On collection day my car was parked right outside which made me feel very special. Various staff said hello and within an hour I was in possession of my new car. The whole process was seamless and completely hassle free. I will definitely recommended this dealership Great service from start to finish and Sophie was faultless."
2018-08-27,5,Fast efficient service - video of service really informative and reassuring.
2018-08-27,5,I thought the whole service experience was great.
2018-08-27,5,"Just purchased a car from the cooper Teeside BMW garage and the service was absolutely superb from start to finish . The sales executive that dealt with us was called Suffyan Khalid and he was extremely professional and polite and kept us informed through the whole process to ensure everything went smoothly .
Highly recommend this garage 👍🏻👍🏻"
2018-08-27,3,Service was ok but was booked in for 8.30 for a key fob coding car went in at 9.15 and we had to wait till11.40 to get it back over three hours for a half hour job is unacceptable
2018-08-27,5,"What a fantastic experience, from start to finish, sales reps were excellent in there conduct and knowledge, thankyou , love my new mini"
2018-08-27,5,"After an initial miscommunication they did everything to get things sorted.
Very good reception and service. Will be using them again, even if it is a longer drive from my home. Thumps ups"
2018-08-27,5,"Great service from Start to finish, thanks Stuart would highly recommend and live the Velar thank you"
2018-08-27,5,Recently purchased a 2017 Gla. Very helpful team of professional people. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality vehicle.
2018-08-27,5,"I bought a car at Coopers BMW Teeside from Michael Deo. Got offered a decent price on the trade-in and travelled from Northern Ireland to get it. On arrival, all the documents were ready to sign, the car I was buying was as described and the sale was complete in an hour. There's always an amount of trepidation that there'll be some sort of problem when you're travelling so far, but everything went like clockwork. I would recommend Coopers BMW Teeside and Michael Deo in particular."
2018-08-27,4,"Very, very good service. Car cleaned as well. Only thing that stopped me giving 5 stars was a video inspection of my car. This said i needed new tyres soon as they had 3.5 to 3.8 mm tread left. The legal limit is 1.6mm.
Otherwise very friendly very helpful staff."
2018-08-27,5,"Polite, helpful and professional"
2018-08-27,5,Amazing service by grant and javeed
2018-08-27,4,"Service was good, but am still waiting for my video link of my car by the engineer"
2018-08-26,4,Natasha was most helpful and kept me upto date what is happening
2018-08-26,5,"Work carried out, as promised. no ""extras""."
2018-08-25,5,Sales person was knowledgeable and not pushy. Car purchased and delivered. Perfect car buying experience.
2018-08-25,4,"My car was in for it's first service. It was a 1 hour service which I was amazed at. Unfortunately, they must have been quite busy as it took more like 1 hour 50 mins. I was pleased with the service though and while I was waiting the WiFi and coffee were good."
2018-08-25,1,"Not impressed at all
Not a welcoming atmosphere when you walk into reception. No acknowledgement from any staff.
Left my car at 08:30. I received no updates or call to say my car was ready so I returned at 15:00 to see if the service had been done. I was informed that it was so thanks for letting me know! When I got to my car, considering it had mean to have been washed inside and out, the back was covered in dirty marks and then inside, the mat on the front passenger side had lots of dirt and dead leaves on it! The female I spoke to explained that ‘it must be dirt from the guys shoes who have done the service!’
This took a further 30 minutes for them to clean and again the attitude from the staff was almost as though I’d ask them to do me a Favour ! After complaining to the service team during my feedback call the next day I was offered a free valet (I don’t think I shall bother seeing as I had the wash the car myself once I’d got home anyway after them allegedly cleaning it) and a free MOT. Ok they didn’t have to offer this and I didn’t complain to receive anything in return.
They asked for feedback so I gave it. Albeit was negative. Suffice to say I don’t think I shall be returning to Mercedes Nottingham any time soon."
2018-08-24,3,"I went to VW Exeter for a car service. The lady who was looking after me was very kind and friendly. After about 2.5 hrs since the start of the service, they came to me and said that the car service itself was all done and it would take a bit longer for hoovering and cleaning of the car. So I waited for about 40 mins more. When everything was done and I went to get my car, my car was not cleaned nor hoovered at all. I don't understand why I had to wait for so long after the service was done when they didn't even clean my car at all???"
2018-08-24,5,Very helpful and efficient Service personnel.
2018-08-24,5,"Southport we’re brilliant, however your central phone service is a joke. Had a BMW last time and the service was head and shoulders"
2018-08-24,3,"I delivered my car at 5 15 p.m. on the Wednesday evening ready for the MOT booked for Thursday 23rd Aug 2018.
Thursday 8.30? I received a phone call from… asking about what to do on the car.
I spent the day waiting for a call from the service dept to let me know when my car would be ready for pick up. I finally had to call the service dept myself around 3 30, the phone rang and rang with no one answering it. I called again and was told that work had not been started.
The reason I took it in the evening before was in hope it would be completed early Thursday morning. If it was that busy why I was not advised on delivery? Communication between the drop of desk and service is very poor. This is not the first time I have complained and sadly nothing has changed much in the improvement of customer service. In my opinion it is getting worse! Front of house staff are a kin to doctor’s receptionists in their manner etc.
I arrived at 5:10 p.m. and told to sit and wait until called. The Customer waiting area is well over due a makeover. The communication lacks any interaction with customers waiting making them feel very insignificant and undervalued.
I was called over to the desk around 5:35 p.m. and presented with a bill for the MOT plus Health check did inform service guy it is covered in the service package I purchased. Again a lack of knowledge of the customer he is dealing with. He apologised and reprinted my bill just for the MOT.
As I said I complained before about the Health check service in March 2018 on my car it was returned late unwashed and the interior not cleaned. I was advised that on my next visit the car would be fully valeted obviously that was not noted as the car although washed outside was not cleaned inside.
I am extremely unhappy with the meet and greet in BMW. The overall service experience with BMW is not up to the standard it was."
2018-08-24,5,"From receiving a courtesy reminder call to being informed throughout the time we spent at Toyota was a service I'd recommend. My car had a full service and MOT and the time and attention received was great.
Thanks for the hot drinks too!"
2018-08-24,2,"This was a visit after a shocking experience a couple of months ago.
The management has changed, invited me back. Unfortunately whilst some improvement is noticeable the car came back with fingerprints all over it. As a full valet, free of charge, was the offer of appeasement for a crap service before, getting a dirty car back was not at all expected. Not good... i sent an email to the manager to give them a chance to respond a week ago. Nothing to date."
2018-08-24,5,"No problems from the moment I booked the service to picking up the car, a very good experience"
2018-08-24,5,"An excellent service experience , very efficient and friendly professional staff"
2018-08-24,3,"First BMW service, disappointing that their advertised customer options weren't available to me. I couldn't have a loan car, was too far for a lift and no collection/drop off available for two weeks which was too long for the mileage I do. Had to sit and wait which was only 90 minutes but means I need to take the car back in if I want the software update as that takes 4-6 hours. Annoyingly, the website said the cost was zero, which surprised me but as it's my first BMW and the first service light, I thought perhaps it was a health check or BMW standard service, no it was £250. BMW customer experience isn't a patch on Audi in my experience."
2018-08-24,5,"We called to view a used Jaguar XF, Alan Wood was extremely helpful and not a bit pushy!! We ended up buying it.
Alan’s handover was superb he had every little detail covered the car looked perfect!! Thankyou"
2018-08-24,5,"Excellent service , very Happy with the whole experience, I was even sent a video showing the checks that had been done"
2018-08-24,4,"This was my first time trying Stockport Audi for my car’s service after a few poor experiences at a nearby main dealership. Car was ready when I came to pick it up and all work had been done plus it had been cleaned and well valeted which was a bonus. Only negatives were that I had to wait around 20 minutes to drop off and pick up which is probably slightly longer than I’ve had elsewhere. Also, strangely my Audi-cam images arrived the following day, so it was fortunate these were nothing serious. Overall experience: fairly good, certainly an improvement on my last couple of services, but possibly not quite the flawless experience I’d expect for the premium price of using a main-dealer."
2018-08-24,1,Went to give my car into a service and the receptionist was answering calls instead of tending to someone who had been booked in and standing in front of her...two calls later she told me to go sit down in the waiting area that smelt funny. Wish there was another merc dealership I could go to in Leicester that values it’s customers time.
2018-08-24,5,"informative, helpful, and very prompt service. very happy with my new car."
2018-08-24,5,"Cooper MINI Reading-Excellent service.
I was able to get an appointment promptly and at a convenient time.The staff were VERY helpful, kept me updated about how the service and MOT were going and made a point of explaining clearly what had been done and why. All in all a very positive experience. Thank you!"
2018-08-24,5,Honest and reliable.
2018-08-24,4,Will also use Audi for everything good service
2018-08-24,4,Very good & prompt service

2018-08-23,1,"Had the misfortune to use Cooper BMW at Sunderland via Aviva insurance company approx two years ago when I lost my keys
My car was taken to them by a recovery firm after being dragged onto the back of a wagon with the alarm going constantly I had to go to Cooper the next day from Hartlepool to collect the courtesy car after this it just got worse as they could not open the car they had my car approx seven weeks broke the drivers side window and still could not open the car
They left all the bits of glass in various parts of the car the battery died because they couldn’t turn the alarm of asked me if something was wrong with it before they got it (car spent most of its time there in alarm mode)
They eventually got a key from BMW then didn’t realise that the car needed reprogramming before giving it back to me with new locks etc
Took several attempts to reprogram the car (charged insurance for every failed attempt)
I’d had the wheel alignment done just before Cooper got the car then had to return it to them as it was all wrong (after being dragged onto wagon)
They charged the insurance company in excess of £2500 plus car rental mostly because of there incompetence
AvIva was no better as they kept me on the phone waiting and when making the claim for well over an hour and even though it says in the small print doesn’t count as a claim or affect no claim it still put the policy cost up
I’m not now and never will again be with Aviva
Or will ever use Cooper BMW at Sunderland
Cooper Teeside later told me all they should have done was apply to BMW UK for a key which would have taken a couple of days
There are other issues but I’ve gone on enough"

2018-08-23,5,Thoroughly excellent in all respects. 10 out of 10 !!
2018-08-23,5,"Andy Ewers was very helpful, I have known the team a very long time and would recommend them to anyone. They work really hard. 👍🏼"
2018-08-23,5,"I phoned up asking if Inchcape could fit me in with no notice that morning to change a headlamp bulb and they were able to. I was only charged for the lamp, not the fitting. Great service. Thank you."
2018-08-23,5,Couldn't have been better. Was able to book online and received email confirmation and updates. Both on drop off and collection the customer service was exceptional and they were very accommodating in my request to have the car back within a couple of hours.
2018-08-23,1,Worst dealership in Derby - My Land Rover Discovery Sport (under warranty) developed a leak on 13 August. Unsure what is was and whether it was going to cause mechanical damage I telephoned the dealership and asked whether I could bring it down for someone to take a quick look to assess. Amazingly I was told that there was no-one available for 10 days to look at it! Was then told to call Land Rover Assist and ask them to take a look at it which I did. They came to my home and said it was an oil leak and needed to go to the dealership! They said they would arrange courtesy car for me to collect when I dropped the car off but I must wait for them to source a car. Some 6 hours later and after I chased them they told me to bring the car in but the courtesy car was actually at the Jaguar dealership a mile away! I dropped car off and walked to collect the Jaguar. I received a call 8 days (Tuesday 21 August) after I had left the Land Rover at the dealership asking me to bring it in to allow someone to look at the oil leak on the Wednesday! I politely told them that the car had been with them for 8 days! It is now 5pm on Thursday 23 August and I have heard absolutely nothing from the dealership. Hopefully they still have my car! Hopefully someone has eventually started to repair it and hopefully someone will contact me sometime this month to let me know when the problem has been resolved. In the meantime I will continue to put the miles onto the very nice Jaguar that I have still got! I was promised an update report on the progress of the repair and have sent 2 emails to Adrian Thomas and unsurprisingly received no communication whatsoever. The customer service at this dealership is absolutely appalling and I see from this blog that I am not the only one who thinks this. I am staggered by the incompetence.
2018-08-23,5,"I just brought my Mini Paceman from the Reading branch and can highly recommend them.
Edwin and Luca were very efficient and helpful and I love my new car.
Thanks for all your help guys."
2018-08-23,5,I was very pleased with the service that I experienced particularly with Emile Hopkins who looked after me
2018-08-23,2,"not very impressed. When I called in to book an appointment I told them, my car is on lease and I gave the company name to confirm and get a go ahead from the lease to do my servicing. Got an email later during the day to review a video and give a respond. I did and phone Audi in Hyde to explain again that, the car is on lease, only to be told my car is on its way at back to me as they didn’t get the response in time but what needed to be done was urgent so I pleaded and i was told the part needed for changing my car has been ordered and it will be in tomorrow. Happy with that so I asked if I could get a courtesy car since this wasn’t in the plan and that day was my day off from work. They agreed only to be given a manual car without even asking whether I drive auto or manual . I drive automatic car so I had to call them again and they said to me, they don’t have automatic cars for courtesy cars! Which I found it to be strange. A renowned company like Audi and you don’t have courtesy cars in automatic!!!! Knowing fully aware that not everybody drives manual cars and these days people prefer automatic cars. After a long conversation and me having to cancel work because I have to drop my daughter off to the nanny and go to work so avoid that stress, I cancelled work.. I got a call back later to say that, they have found me an automatic car! Really!!! I got the car an hour later at home only to find out that there isn’t any petrol in the car. I had filled my tank up before I gave it to them so I expected as customer, at least put in half tank so when am done I fill it up again. I ended not taking the car to work and because I couldn’t have even get to the petrol station before I get stuck on the road. I felt they couldn’t be bothered to be nice or offer proper service to me. Am not sure wether because I am a woman or what. Not impressed and I was planning to keep the car after the lease ends but from this poor customer service I wouldn’t want to have any Audi cars. Lexus offer the best customer service and I will go back to Lexus after this. Very disappointed"
