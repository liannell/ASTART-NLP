8/23/18,2,"Booked in for an MOT, arrived at 8am waited for 20 minuets to be told unable to do MOT due to ramp being broke. Would have been nice to have been contacted before, lots of inconvenience caused."
8/23/18,5,Excellent customer service and the staff made sure that we got the car specification that we wanted - all within our price range!
8/23/18,5,"Today at Audi maidstone i was greeted by Ben who explained in detail how long the job would take and after showing me where the refreshments were they took my car and did the work that was required. The job took no longer than was 1st explained to me by Ben.
Overall a very good professional service one which i would recommend."
8/23/18,5,"Had a small problem, they sorted out for me and then washed and vacuumed my car for me ... brilliant."
8/23/18,4,"Seamless, painless, hassle free process.
Car was serviced as expected when expected, came back mini valeted and dent free. Equivalent level loan car, which is appreciated.
Thank you"
8/23/18,1,"Disappointed! Bad customer service .
Usually very good but not today .
Lady at reception desk welcoming customer really rude . Name is Dot . Should not be working there face to customers

8/23/18,5,From the moment we arrived at Coopers Reading we were treated extremely well. There is a air of efficient professionalism about the place. We were kept fully informed about what was going on and the car was returned to us after its check up and sat nav update in showroom condition. The best part was that it was completely free of charge
8/23/18,5,"Wanted a car, went in, saw one, bought one. Simple!"
8/23/18,5,Nick Jimson at Cooper Stockton was very helpful and professional. He kept me fully updated 're my new car and on delivery explained all the features on it. Would highly recommend him if buying a new BMW.
8/23/18,5,"First time using southport.
had a great experience from dropping car of. being handed a courtesy car and they called to advise when mine was ready to collect.
collected car had been cleaned and serviced.
very pleased and could not fault them at all."
8/23/18,5,Ist class service as always.
8/23/18,5,"Inchcape VW Colchester have been looking after my latest car for the last 5 years and 100,000 miles, (im on my 4th Passat which they have looked after) all work has been carried out to a really high standard and i have never had any issues with the quality of the work, all the staff work well together as a team to ensure everything is completed on time and as quoted, the service advisors are brilliant and lead by a very committed manager."
8/23/18,4,"Great experience of 30K miles service & MoT at Cooper Thames Dutton, with special thanks to Matthew at Service Desk, who responded excellently to each of my questions. Dropped a star only due to 2 very trivial points - light switch left in off position (my normal setting is auto) so I was driving in the dark without lights that night, until flashed! I also suspect tyre pressures weren’t checked, as they were at minimum level before and after - and I note this action isn’t included on the service checklist. Everything else was excellent."
8/23/18,5,Excellent service which far exceeded my expectations . I received a video of the health check performed on my car and it was explained to me when I collected the car also . Absolutely amazing service and lovely polite and attentive staff.
8/22/18,2,"The service video that has to be responded to is overkill, I would rather a quick call to ask whether works can be carried out. I was not in a position to watch an email in the day.
The prices quoted for items such as tyres are way above competitors.
The tyres weren't in stock but were with competitors.
I was offered a wash and clean in and out. This should be standard practice on a 50k car, not a special. It was also cleaned very badly, not wiped down and, aside from a quick hoover, the inside wasn't touched.
The courtesy car was far inferior. It should be better than my own or at least as good.
I asked them to check a left hand speaker which vibrates at anything over quiet. I was told that it looked fine but at 4pm there were no technicians left to discuss it with.
The net result was I had a regular oil change and a call in corrected in what amounted to a great hullabaloo.
I was also told that I needed both discs and pads very soon at about £650! Having bought the car at 8000 miles from Audi with full cover and been only 11000 miles myself I am pretty shocked to hear that discs are required already.
So all in all pretty disappointed.
Finally, I am not a ""Captain""."
8/22/18,5,My experience yesterday at inchcape was excellent. Everything worked well. I was informed at every stage of my service and Steve was friendly and informative. Nothing was too much trouble. Thanks.
8/22/18,3,"On arriving couldn't find a parking space so had to drive around and wait for one to become free at 9.30 am ?. booking in was slow only one person checking customers in and out that I could see, eventually, the same one lady come to see me and checked me in. I confirmed that the brakes needed attention and a recall outstanding. I also asked for the air conditioning to be checked as I thought it was not very cold in the recent hot weather and after 2 years thought it would need to be regassed anyway. On a collection of my car, I was informed that the brakes and recall had been done but no mention of the air conditioning being checked or regassed. The car was cleaned but found oily black finger marks on the glove box."
8/22/18,1,"If you feel you must buy from this company then triple check before buying a used car from them that it's not a company lease car. This fact was deliberately hidden in our case. The car has been back twice for damage to the bodywork which wasn't immediately visible when we bought it. Having found a damaged cover underneath the car we requested a full check for any further issues. There is in fact damage that should have been dealt with prior to putting it on sale, it would have been impossible not to see this when the broken cover was replaced. Despite several emails and photo of the damage still nothing has been done. It's now been over a month since we first contacted them and our patience has run out. We now intend to have an independent check carried out on the car and then seek legal advice. Buyer beware, once they have your money they don't want to know!

UPDATE on this review. Emailed contactus@inchcape no reply! Still nothing from the dealer either. Not really surprised, didn't expect anything.

Update September 23rd.
Decided to give the dealer one last chance. Booked a service and asked for the damaged unit to be checked out at the same time. According to their Service Technician there isn't any internal damage and its in good working order. Given that the unit is sealed and only a visual inspection was carried out we're left to assume their Technicians are equipped with xray vision.

Looks like we have no other option now than have the independent check carried out.

Note also there is absolutely no point in emailing 'tellusmore' they simply don't reply to them, I doubt they're even read!"
8/22/18,5,All contact was very professional and efficient. The service video I was emailed afterwards was very impressive.
8/22/18,5,"Friendly and efficient staff, plenty of information about the progress of the work on the car and a welcoming atmosphere. Decent coffee too!"
8/22/18,1,Horrendous aftercare when buying from Cheshire Oaks. Having to return to the branch 3 times to fix what should have been done when handing the car over... costing me time and money... we won’t go through the miss selling issue. Which is being dealt with via the Financial Ombusman Service. Still no V5 either!!!!! I can hand on heart say they don’t care about their after service. Once the car is sold the car is sold.
8/22/18,5,Lovely friendly staff could not fault them 10 out of 10 would certainly recommend them to my friends well done
8/22/18,5,"Excellent Service received, Mercedes for Customer Service and Support."
8/22/18,5,I have always received excellent service at BMW Cooper Durham.
8/22/18,5,"Good service

Nice staff members.

Free tea and coffee and WiFi to work whilst you are waiting.

Reasonably fast car service and clean

Would recommend"
8/22/18,3,"Car was booked in at least 6 weeks prior, with a loan car. I received a voice mail message 7.30pm the evening before to state loan vehicle was not available. They did provide a taxi to get me home but this didn't help me for the rest of the day. The service guy who dealt with me was not interested in the problems that they had caused me and made that very obvious."
8/22/18,5,"Great service and friendly staff, would highly recommend to anyone."
8/22/18,3,"Service agent was very helpful on arrival and had arranged the loan car, although there was some confusion over the fee since the work was covered by service plan (Ad blue fill) and warranty (transmission rattle). The loan car we got was almost new but very dirty inside and something sticky had been left on the seat which my wife had to clean-up before sitting down.

We made it clear that we would like to be kept informed of progress so that we could plan the day, plus we had to get on the road home by 16.00. I called after about 3 hours and was told that the car was still being evaluated and I would be notified when it was ready. At 15.00 I still hadn't heard anything so I called again. Only then was I told that a none scheduled oil change was required and I would need to pay a significant sum for this on a car with less than 10,000 miles from new (not coverd by service plan!). I was also told that the transmission noise issue had been diagnosed and a replacement exhaust part would be required which will require another visit.

When we returned to pick-up the car just before 16.00 it was still not ready. We had a discussion on the oil bill and a compromise was made although it was revealed that if the car had been registered two months later the oil change would have been covered by the service plan (this means that LR has determined that this is a common issue!)...

The fee for the loan car was waived but I am not looking forward to another trip to the garage to get the exhaust part replaced. I was shocked at the cost of this part and I am relieved it is covered by warranty.

I have not had these reliability and service issues with my much cheaper Skoda.....LR needs to up their game!"
8/22/18,4,A well organised service experience My car collected by punctual driver with work sheet as requested. Progress reported in morning with video sent to justify need for one new tyre to replace damaged rear tyre. Car returned in excellent condition with service sheet and receipt.
8/22/18,1,"For anything Service-related, expect a painful experience after you’ve booked your vehicle in. The key problem is the model they use whereby you’re allocated a service advisor who is the only person you will deal with on the phone and in person from booking in your vehicle right through to collecting it. In theory this should provide a good personal service however in practice they never explicitly explain that this is their process and the system just doesn’t work at all.

You will arrange times to drop off/collect your vehicle but there is no ‘check-in’ desk in the Service area so you have to hope you can catch someone’s attention. There is a Rentals desk in this area that appears to be linked to Service but the guy sat here will never look up and acknowledge you even if you stand right in front of him and speak. Even then he won’t make eye contact or look up to help you. Perhaps if his role is not customer-facing he shouldn’t be sat here. At this point once somebody has acknowledged you, expect to wait up to half an hour beyond your scheduled appointment to actually see your service advisor. Whilst you wait you will witness several staff walking around together or sat at desks laughing and joking but not helping you as you are not their allocated customer. This doesn’t help with any frustrations you may have due to the delays you are experiencing and were not told to expect.

If you’ve booked a Courtesy Vehicle, expect to see customers with the smallest cars being allocated the largest courtesy vehicles available, whilst if you have a large car you will find that you are allocated the smallest. I’m not sure how this is mutual or logical.

If you’ve had any problems fixed, check that they are actually fixed before you leave, as they are not always, and check for damage as customers have had damage occur whilst their vehicle has been in for work.

The service staff themselves are friendly and courteous but unfortunately they are being forced to adhere to process which are inefficient and non-customer centric.

I can only hope that this dealership reviews customer waiting times and staff productivity so that they recognise there is a problem with their approach and change the model.

As my review is based on two recent visits I’ll be using an alternative VW dealership for all future VW Service requirements."
8/22/18,4,car was collected and dropped off as arranged.Driver was professional and polite. Office staff a bit abrupt on telephone .Engineer issued car/work invoice and findings with the wrong size rear tyres on vehicle-after speaking on telephone with service dept I was informed that the invoice could not be altered-so now my records show my car with different tyres
8/22/18,1,"I took my BMW 520d for a complimentary BMW recall for the rear lightbulbs to be replaced.
Since , I now have a bill of £67.70 for a free of charge recall.
Better still, I now have a ""rear lightbulb failure"" alert after the lightbulbs were replaced . When BMW were called first thing the next morning (found this out after closing hours) that I could have the pleasure of driving all the way back in to have it resolved with a waiting time of 90 minutes.
Better still! This garage now state that the fault code MAY not be there fault.........no words."
8/22/18,5,"Quick, efficient and no messing about. Concocted some kind of deal and I had no complaints. Good work."
8/22/18,5,"I have always used this company and they are easy to deal with, are flexible in meeting your arrangements and return you car very clean and tidy after service."
8/22/18,5,"A fantastic service as always, would highly recommend Inchcape Telford"
8/22/18,5,Took my VW Golf in for its first service. I was met a very courteous member of staff and was attended to at the appointed time. The service was completed promptly and the video that was sent to my mobile was most helpful
8/22/18,3,"Really liked the visual inspection video
Car wasn't cleaned, which it usually is
Collection & delivery driver very helpful/friendly"
8/22/18,5,"Easy booking, clean loan car and easy pick-up. Exactly what I expect when my car needs a service."
8/22/18,1,"My S class is back in for repairs that weren't completed properly by inchcape Ellesmere Port, after my last visit, in which they had the car for nearly two weeks.
Is had almost £2k in repairs to the suspension. When I got it back it was still 40mm low in one corner... No one had stood back to admire their sub-standard work or noticed the scratches to the wheel arches that appeared after being with them..
I then had to wait 2 weeks to get it booked back in... this I did.
That was two days ago at 8am, when they 'hoped' they would put it right.
I then phoned them at lunchtime to check progress, no one had managed to look at it.... then a phone call at 5pm... they need to keep it another day !!
Still not had a call about my car.... although now I can only 'HOPE'

Regards
One of many disgruntled customers"
8/21/18,5,I have chosen for the second year for servicing and MOT. They are very professional and always there to give best to their customers.
8/21/18,5,"Wolfgang Pempe at Inchcape Volkswagen Twickenham was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly throughout our experience. He explained in great detail the features of the VW Golf, and the process through which we have now gone through to purchase our lovely VW Golf. We highly recommend Wolfgang."
8/21/18,5,Excellent experience very helpul salesman Chris
8/21/18,1,Reception won’t even offer my wife a drink after kids where screaming for a drink because she wasn’t buying a vehicle jus in there for servicing of our Mercedes. Totally unacceptable!!!!!
8/21/18,1,"I dropped my car into Coopers BMW in Waddon for its annual MOT check, I told them that I would wait for the car which they agreed would be fine and that it would take approx. 1 1/2hours. Having arrived at 9.25am for a 9.30 appointment, all paperwork was completed and I sat in the waiting area. Approx 2 hours later, I was asked by a member of staff if I was being seen too. They then went off to check the status of my car and was told they were dealing with the MOT. Half an hour later another member of staff came over an explained that my paperwork had been put in the wrong pile and that they are now doing the MOT and all should be done in approx. 20 minutes. Approx 40 minutes later another member of staff came over and said the car was being cleaned and if I could settle my bill which I did. Then went back to the waiting area. Approx 40 minutes later I had to again chase up a member of staff to ask what was going on as I had now been waiting almost 4 hours. He then went off to check again to return approx. 10 minutes later with my car. This delay caused me to be over two hours late for getting to work which meant I then had to stay extra late into the evening at work to catch up on my own work. BMW were quick to ask for payment for this work but only after 4 hours did I get any kind of an apology. Not once did the original person who served me update me on what was going on or apologise for the delay despite several times looking over where I was seated and even walking past me on more than one occasion. This is an not the first time that the service has been poor but this is certainly the worst I have experienced since I have owned my BMW and one which will probably deter me from purchasing a New BMW next year when I expect to change my car"
8/21/18,5,My Mini Countryman was due a service at Belmont and I can advise everything went smoothly from beginning to end. Andrea who dealt with me was extremely friendly and professional and I was sorted and out with courtesy car in a few minutes. Got call to collect my car and again minimal time to sort me out. Was taken to my car with Andrea holding brolly over us both as it was raining ensuring right up to getting in car I was covered. The car was gleaming and smelled lovely and fresh and was cleaned inside. Fantastic service from beginning to end. Well done!! Very impressed.
8/21/18,5,"A perfect experience, excellent staff , the professionalism, care and attention was second to none. I purchased a new X3. Was guided throughout by Christina who was exceptional.
This the third car I have bought from this company and would highly recommend them."
8/21/18,5,"Just bought a nearly new Mini Cooper from Cooper mini Teesside. We made 2 visits before purchasing the car. We dealt with Adiel who I can’t speak highly enough of. This was the most pleasant car buying experience I have ever had.

Having done a lot of research online, I had a fair idea what I was looking for. Adiel asked our requirements and picked out the cars that fitted the bill. We then visited the following week and made the purchase, again dealing with Adiel who was able to answer our questions. We had a test drive and agreed a deal, I even got a reasonable price for our part-ex which is very rare nowadays.

We picked the car up and so far(touch wood) we are over the moon with it. When we picked it up the spare key wasn’t available. This was delivered to my work by Adiel in his own time.

Very pleased with our experience."
8/21/18,1,"i have been a customer at liverpool merc for the last 25 yrs. ever since.inchcape taken over the customer service has deteriorated.once the car is sold they are not interested any more with you.no one available to answer the queries. no one will return the calls. To add to the injustice recently i bought a GLE displayed milage 15 000 paid 32 k.after delivery i noticed the milage was 24,000.i brought into attention of sales. all i was told we will look into it.i am still awaiting for a answer since may 29th.sales person is a useless guy.but for ashley alfonsa sales manager who is a friend i will never go there."
8/21/18,5,"Excellent service. I was kept informed and car was ready on time. Full marks for the vallet, it was spotless and smelt like new."
8/21/18,5,"Excellent
Very good service Suffiyan was helpful and pleasant .
However our family use a lot of bmw dearlerships and service differs why not make it all uniform just a suggestion"
8/21/18,5,Excellent customer service from first calling to see about getting a mini! Kept me up to date throughout the process and would recommend to anyone. 10/10
8/21/18,5,"Very easy and simple process, the Salesman was very helpful and nothing was to much trouble. The vehicle was prepared ahead of schedule and is a delight."
8/21/18,5,"Great, friendly service."
8/21/18,5,"Very friendly and polite staff & a professional service. I was sent a short video via email of underneath the car showing tyres, suspension etc, picked the car up & it had been washed and vacuumed. Overall extremely happy."
8/21/18,1,"From the very top management at Southport the response is totally unreliable. eg not getting back to you as promised.
It would appear that quality of vehicle can not be relied on, as with service from dealership. There are no procedure in place to deal with customer issues in the event of absenteeism. Persistently told that one cannot expect vehicle with high electronic content, to be correct upon delivery!
This is my worst new car experience in twelve years of new cars. It would seem that the expression ""Right First Time"" is not known or understood by this organisation. Neither is that of ""Customer Satisfaction"""
8/21/18,5,"Great service, would highly recommend Mercedes Southport."
8/21/18,5,I was very pleased with the way they got my car in few days and all the finance arranged . Louis walsh and Melanie hayward at crydon bmw were excellent .Thank you .I am recommending my brother them.
8/21/18,5,Prompt efficient service and friendly too.
8/21/18,3,"Everything was fine & when Steve told us the car was ready & dealt with the paperwork & payment, he returned the key & told us the car had been cleaned inside & out so off we toddled happily to the car.
Oops, the bird muck & cobwebs were still on the outside & it didn’t look like anything had been done on the inside as dust was still on the dash & tops of door panels.
I know the clean is classed as complimentary but if your gonna say your gonna do it I expect it to be done.
Everything else was ok."
8/21/18,5,Sunderland Mini very you can trust
8/21/18,4,Expensive but good service
8/21/18,1,"A genuinely appalling experience in every respect. I purchased a `Signature` RR Sport Supercharged from LR Derby, which when delivered was found to have a list of faults. It went back to the dealership to have all the works carried out a few days later.

After 2 weeks I had to chase them to find out when the car would be returned. I chased (phone calls and emails) several times as no one contacted me, and only after I requested, by email, a full refund under the Consumer Rights Act (2015), of the purchase price and warranty (and 2 months RFL), and copied in the business manager as well as the dealer principal, Adrian Thomas, did anyone actually call me.

I was called by someone from the dealership who I had never talked to before, who told me there was a major problem with the engine, more specifically with the turbo, and it may necessitate a replacement engine. As such, I would receive a full refund.

Of course the RR Sport Supercharged is, well, Supercharged, so does not have a turbo.........

It took several more weeks to actually receive my refunds (one for the car and the other for the warranty and part RFL), again, after numerous calls and emails, including to the dealer principal, who never bothered to contact me. Nice leadership and a quality example of customer care......

To give credit where some may be due, the salesman was very polite and helpful during the process when I was buying the car, which is OK if it is as described and works.

The car may have been a lemon, but the follow up when I discovered it actually was a lemon, was justification for the reputation that car dealers have.

By all means buy a car from these people, just cross your fingers that nothing goes wrong......"
8/21/18,2,"Booked via central booking for drop off prior to 8.15am.
Arrived at 8.05am to be told there was no drop-off and I had to wait in a 6 strong queue for service reception to open.
I explained this was not an option for me and the very off-hand receptionist told me there was no option. When I explained that I had to either cancel the booking or leave the keys as I could not wait for the six people in front of me to discuss requirements.
Eventually I was given an envelope to put the keys in along with my details.
I then received a call advising that the car would be ready at 5pm and the garage closed at 5.45pm. I advised that I would be there about 5.30pm. I duly arrived at 5.20 to be told that the car was being washed and left to wait. No-one came near me for to update or explain further until the keys were brought to me at 5.45 just as the garage closed and was not cleaned on the inside as I was told it would be.
You need to work on your drop off process, the attitude of your receptionist and getting the car ready for the agreed time.
I have to say it all felt a little bit like the customer had to fit around your process and your business which frankly is simply not good enough.
The two star rating is accurate."
8/21/18,5,"Just purchased a BMW 520 M sport from
Bmw cooper Stockton.
Got a great deal from Michael Deo.
Smooth transaction under no pressure at all to purchase had the car ready for me in a couple of days and it looks stunning.
Absolutely over the moon with it

Thank you Michael Deo

Mr jeffreys,"
8/21/18,5,"Excellent Service, literally!"
8/21/18,5,First class service and was kept up to date with the process from booking in a service to collect and deliver . All the staff were very helpful and friendly a big thank you
8/21/18,5,Great personal and professional service from Cooper Teesside in the purchase of my new BMW vehicle. Suvodeep Paul deserves a mention for his support through the whole process. Thank You !
8/21/18,5,Excellent would highly recommend. Service received was brilliant.
8/21/18,5,"There's a reason why I take my car to a dealer an hour away...

Cooper Cobham look after me and my M5 perfectly. I always get told what's going on, I always get told what they have done, what they propose to do and what the implications are, and (this is important) they always listen when I tell them what's wrong.

Plus the coffee is nice and the reception staff are absolutely delightful :)"
8/21/18,5,"I recently purchased an XE R Sport from Inchcape Norwich and the service I received was exemplary. Nothing was too much trouble and the care given on handover was second to none. I could not find fault with any of the staff from the Manager down to the lady on reception. The sales advisor, Blake, is a credit to the company and has to be the best car salesman I have ever met."
8/21/18,5,"We dealt with Morshad Ali in the Used Sales team - a very knowledgeable and patient advisor who understood our needs and pointed us in the direction of the vehicle that was right for us, and then went the extra mile to source the vehicle. Nothing was too much trouble for Morshad. Everything he said he would do he did."
8/21/18,5,"Booked with ease,very friendly welcome,quick service,average clean but overall fantastic service,highly recommended"
8/20/18,5,"Courteous efficient service, the video was a great bonus"
8/20/18,5,"As always, Paul Lacey at Cooper BMW, Tunbridge Wells gave me first class service and attention to detail. Always a pleasure to deal with him and the dealership whom I have been using since they took over the previous business of L&C BMW."
8/20/18,3,"Update 24th August 2018

Happy to say my car is now back with the dealer with a promise to correct everything, they have provided me with a courtesy car in the meantime so for these reasons I have altered my rating which I will update again when I have my car back and all is to my satisfaction.

20 August 2018 Just purchased a used BMW X3 with Coopers at Boldon (Sunderland) paid my deposit when requested dealer sorted finance agreed price and mileage need at 8000 miles per year, a few hiccups along the process on two visits asked to see the car first one I made the trip especially with family to check the car over was told was locked in compound even though this had been arranged in advance anyway apology given along with promise for extra diesel in as recompence (this did not happen) anyway they arranged to have the car brought to my work to view which they did and upon inspection needed some things putting right was told these would be done, went again to sign for finance and had asked to see car again but it wasn’t there was in the body shop, so it came to me picking the car up on Saturday just gone 18th August, was picked up by sales executive as was unable to arrange a lift, good start I thought, got there to find all work hadn’t been done but was assured would be booked in on Monday to do this, also during signing all the paperwork asked for confirmation of finance arrangement again was told 8000 miles allowance per year requested a copy was told it would be sent to me from the finance company separately.

Received details from the finance company yesterday to find out dealers had put through mileage allowance at 6000 miles per year, no good to me at all bought the car at 8000 ! So called first thing this morning was told Sales executive was off this week so requested for the Sales Manager to call me after explaining what the issues were, by 1.30pm still not heard from anyone so called again asked for Sales Manager only to be put through to my Sales Executive, was surprised he was there he said he had called in on his time off to finish off paperwork and was sorting out booking my car into the body shop, I then told him about the mileage issue he confirmed again that 8000 miles was agreed and that he would sort this out also and get back to me, I would expect this to be sorted straight away as this is miss selling to me very unprofessional and not impressed at all have a feeling I’m being fobbed off which is just not on from a reputable dealer at all, so we will see what tomorrow brings, will update this post then but not holding my breath ! This car is a treat to myself for my upcoming 50th Birthday and this service is starting to taint this.

Update.

I have emailed Inchcape at 11.50 am today 21/8/2018 in response to their reply below and currently awaiting a response from them, not heard at all from the dealership"
8/20/18,4,"Quick, efficient service and good communication... much improved."
8/20/18,3,"Service side of my experience was very positive, however, dealing with sales side not at all positive.
Enquirer about looking at an X4, staff couldn’t have been less interested, left standing for a while then asked to sit and wait. Told to help myself to coffee, however, next customer had coffe made for him, wondered what I had to do to have mine made for me instead of having to make my own? Drank the coffee, sat for a while and not one person let me know what was happening so got up and left, not one member of staff approached my and asked why I was leaving, just watched me walk out! Possible sale of an X4 lost guys!"
8/20/18,5,We were very pleased with the service we received from the staff the salesman we dealt with was Kevin Perera he was very knowledgeable and nothing was to much trouble I would be very happy to recommend BMW Croydon to our friends and family
8/20/18,5,"I would like to give Audi Macclesfield, and in particular Neil Cameron a 5 star rating. Throughout my dealings with him he was courteous, patient and extremely knowledgeable - Thank you Neil I love my new Q3!"
8/20/18,4,"Great service from all at the loughborough branch!
Only down side is the wash my car received.. smears and water marks all over the outside of the car.. awful damp smell when we got back Into the car and the the tyres hadn’t even been washed they were still dirty. It’s now need to be washed again. Really disappointed with that part other than that everyone at the Loughborough branch was warm welcoming and friendly"
8/20/18,5,"Really great experience, selected car of choice throughthe Mini website enquiry, got a response from Jamie at Cooper Ipswich the next day, went to showroom, Jamie was armed with his figures for the car I thought I wanted only for me to walk in and see another car that I liked better! Jamie took it all in his stride, and I walked out the showroom with a brand new car just a week later. The service I received was excellent and I would not hesitate to recommend a trip to Cooper Ipswich and also can’t fault Jamie for his dedication to helping me get the right car and the right deal."
8/20/18,5,"Excellent service from BMW Colchester whilst my car was in for a service and MOT.

As a company car driver for the last 25 years the service I have received from many other manufacturors when my cars have needed work of any sort has often left me feeling second class to privately owned car drivers. This certainly was not the case at BMW. First class from start to finish and will play a big part in my decision when choosing a new company car."
8/20/18,5,had car serviced and mot polite service collection and delivery on time.only complaint is they are expensive but as stated good reliable service from all staff
8/20/18,4,Very good Audi dealership.
8/20/18,5,The service we received was second to none from start to finish so professional would definitely recommend them...Audrey Atchinson
8/20/18,1,"I can't quite believe such a bad service can come so naturally, so I can only assume Mercedes Liverpool must be providing training to be this bad. The list of bad experiences is endless for me and I do not want to bore you, but as a summary, they do not answer the phone and they do not return your voice mails and if you eventually manage to speak to someone, they promise a call back and do not call. I love my MB car, but the service behind the car is like torture. So much so that I will never have another Mercedes again. I did try Mercedes Chester and they were possibly even worse. I then looked at the reviews for Mercedes Warrington and they are also terrible. I did complain to Mercedes direct but they sent me an automated response that shown they did not even read my email. So clearly, Mercedes just do not care. As an example of the bad service I have received, my car went into the garage 5 times to have the same fault fixed under warranty. Each time they would drop the car back to me saying it was fixed and I would get in the car and it was not fixed. The driver would then say it was nothing to do with him and that I would need to get it booked in again. Strangely, the 5th time I took the car in myself and said I would not leave until it was fixed and miraculously, it got fixed. Another issue was some oxidization of the paintwork. I was told that I would have to pay for this as it was not covered under the warranty, as it may have been caused by the cleaning fluid in the car wash. The bill would be over £2000. So the message here, if you buy a Mercedes, never clean it. Another issue was with the tyres. They collected the car and then phoned me to tell me the tyre had a small split in the side and that it needed a new tyre. They did not have a tyre to match the car so I said I would get it somewhere else, they then explained they would not return the car then. So they picked it up without checking the tyres and that was fine, but would not return it without me paying to have an odd tyre fitted. And by the way, the tyre price was £220 and when I got a price for the exact same tyre from my local garage, it was £140 fitted. I did mention this when the car was next in and the response was that they cannot get the tyres that cheap, so I showed them on my phone where I could order just the tyre for £120 and they said they had to use their own supplier. Is this not crazy? So I have learned the hard way. I wanted the first few bad experiences to just be bad luck on my side but it is not the case. So I will swap my car soon to get away from this frustrating so called service and I will never return, which is a shame as I do like the cars. Clearly, many other people have had a bad experience like me and I can’t believe Mercedes just do not care, this is not the same for other car manufactures and I can’t believe Mercedes get away with it. Well not with me anymore. Note: I could provide many more bad experiences but they are all just the same concept. The only good experience was when they were taking my money when I bought the car. One last thing, you may wonder why I have not posted earlier, this is through fear of my car being ill-treated. Since they lie to me constantly, I have no idea what bad behavior they are capable of so I have waited until I am ready to sell the car. I know, this is a terrible way of thinking but it shows how little trust I have with Mercedes service."
8/20/18,5,I was really impressed. Service very good and professional. Good value for an excellent product
8/20/18,2,"Sadly, and unusually in my experience, this service did not go well. Given where I live I need a courtesy car, so when I booked I asked for the first date one would be available and therefore booked August 17th (some weeks ahead). When I checked in at 0800 on 17 August I was told that the courtesy car would be a ""problem"". I protested as it had been promised and was given one. In the course of driving home I was called by Coopers to say that car had in fact been sold, so would I come back and change it. Which I did. I called back at 1500 to ask when the car would be ready, only to be told that it would be the following day as the workshop was very busy. I protested (it was a small service!!) and asked to speak to a member of management. They said one would call back but no one did, so I headed to Cobham at 5pm. On the way I got a call saying the car would be ready at 6.15pm. So I waited and got the car back, unwashed, then. While I was waiting I could see the lady I had dealt with. She did not talk to me, and put on her coat at 6pm and went home. If instead of telling me my car would not be ready she had just said ""we have a real problem here, could you possibly help us and wait for your car until tomorrow??"" I would probably have agreed, but this needs just a little bit of customer service thinking. Instead she had said ""well, you have got wheels anyway, so it's not a problem, is it?"" Well actually yes, especially going through all that had happened, it was indeed a problem as I had other things to do the following morning!!"
8/20/18,5,I was very pleased with the treatment we received. They were very pleasant and went out of their way to be helpful.
8/20/18,4,"A Service for my E Class. Service advisor Dave was excellent as always. Only downside was the car was not given a complimentary wash. Not the end of the world buts it’s small touches like that which I expect from Mercedes Benz every time, not sometimes."
8/20/18,4,"I found Cooper Malton very helpful. The sales guy Billy was honest and very approachable
I was happy with the deal I got on the car and the cars condition
However I was a little disappointed with the handover as I thought it was unprepared I only collected 1 key as the whereabouts of the spare was unknown at that time
I did not feel the car had been fully valleted inside as the chrome pack was pitted and not clean and there was an old coffee stain next to the gear stick the vallet was poor
There was also other info I had to go back the next day to ask ie service info and breakdown cover
But overall it was a pleasant buying experience"
8/20/18,4,"Car picked up and returned.
Arrangements very smooth with no fuss.
Not giving 5 stars because car was not washed or vacuumed which I have had at other dealers."

8/20/18,5,"I bought my new ‘used’ Mini direct from the Sunderland branch. From finding the vehicle on the Inchcape website to delivery, I couldn’t have asked for better service. Special thanks to Grace for guiding me through the process and answering all my questions as I did not actually view the car in person as I live in London. Also thanks to Gary ( hope I have the name right) the driver who delivered the car, for his patience in showing me all the controls etc. I am very pleased with my new purchase."
8/20/18,4,An inconsistent rattle in a car is not always taken seriously by service teams but I found sincere courtesy and a resolution to the problem.

8/19/18,5,"Everything went very well, I felt comfortable buying from this company. The only downside was after spending so much money on the car, I then had to pay another £150 on car mats which was a let down for me."
8/18/18,5,"Thanks to all at Mercedes in Warrington for great customer service. Espectially Martyn from the Servicing team.

Wouldnt't hesitate to take my car back for work in the future."
8/18/18,2,"Not friction as staff were fine, however a 30 minute wait to drop keys off is unacceptable.
Car was cleaner before service than after so called valet. Don't offer this service if not prepared to complete job to acceptable standard."
8/18/18,5,"I purchased a used Tiguan in excellent condition,which I am very pleased with,but I had a stress crack in the dashboard which I found out later was not covered by my guarantee ,approached the company and they agreed to pay a very good percentage of the repair as a goodwill gesture.Car was picked up from my home ,repaired ,and delivered back.I have found all staff at Inchcape obliging and helpful. Bill Cullum ."
8/18/18,5,"Every one I have dealt with at mini has been amazing! Polite, friendly , taken time to help you choose the right car and make the right decisions etc. The cars are fab and speak for themselves but the staff are by far the best I’ve dealt with when purchasing a car! I dealt with Adam and Adam!! Both Adams were great!!"

8/17/18,5,Wholly satisfactory experience with this dealership. Order to delivery went like clockwork. Excellent.
8/17/18,2,"I dropped my car off around 9.30 for a routine recall. When I returned at the agreed time, 4pm, the work had not been done. No one bothered to contact me to alert me to problems, excuses were feeble and apology grudging. I offer two stars as the car was collected and returned efficiently 2 days later. Not the first time I’ve had poor service at this branch."
8/17/18,5,Continues to be the best car buying/car owning experience I think I've had!

8/17/18,4,Friendly bunch and did the work required
8/17/18,1,"I'm not happy with Mercedes coventry for the following reasons:-
I asked for service history on a new car I had purchased and was advised none available only later to be provided with a complete printout the car had been serviced 3 months earlier at 65000 and I just paid £302 to have it serviced at 69000 ...a bit of honesty would have been nice.
Secondly a warranty repair was rejected due to a subjective view of assor who was "" afraid Mercedes UK may not pay for the work""... it was a £40 repair cost.

After my post I received an email from tellusmoreinchcape.co.uk so I replied that evening 20th August 2018 with my experience but as yet I have had no reply to my email or been contacted via phone , at this point it is looking like an empty gesture.
I also visited the openday at Mercedes Coventry and spoke to the manager who assured me the matter would be looked into but again no contact from anyone at Inchcape."
8/17/18,5,Alan Wood Sales Exec. provided excellent service & as speedy a completion as possible to the trade in and purchase of our new vehicle ( given the weight of paperwork inevitably involved in the process).
8/17/18,5,Great service by a real professional team. Janet in the service dept was first class and couldn’t do enough to help us.

Thanks."
8/17/18,1,Great got a response saying sorry for the coffee machine and not the reasons for a 4.5hr service time or why service staff have not contacted me too explain why it took so long
8/17/18,5,Everything was catered for despite the complications of changing the plates for my new car. The staff were attentive and helpful at all times.
8/16/18,5,Paul at Inchcape Burton-On-Trent was great from start to finish. He explained everything clearly and was not pushy in any way. He answered all of my questions without hesitation and was really friendly and helpful. I would use Inchcape Burton again.
8/16/18,5,Went above and beyond; professional and efficient. VW setting high standards
8/16/18,5,"I was greeted by a very professional Service Adviser (Alan Coates) who covered every point both prior to and post the vehicle being repaired. He was extremely smart, courteous and a credit to York Cooper Mini."
8/16/18,4,Very professional curtious and fast

8/16/18,4,Happy with service. nice touch cleaning the car inside and out. Staff positive and friendly. Negative point I waited half an hour in reception to pay for my service and pick up the keys even though the service had been completed and the car was in the car park.
8/16/18,3,"Very poor customer service once car had been inspected and fault found
Had to chase for booking car in and quote
No one returned my calls and had to actually visit the showroom to get some answers. Met with very frosty response and told she was very busy and had customers waiting. Happy with technical response but very poor experience for my first visit. Don’t intend to return"
8/16/18,5,"What a fantastic experience from start to finish ... The staff are so lovely from Andy who took trouble far beyond my expectations .. Nigel the mechanic was so helpful ...

Thankyou Toyota of Burton on trent x"

8/16/18,5,"Had 3rd annual service on my Discovery 4 yesterday. Booked it early; new loan car made available for me (Jag Sport Estate) but still prefer my Disco. Excellent service by reception, Josy, video report on car and best of all nothing to pay thanks to my Service Pack which is well worth taking with any car let alone a LR. Thanks Inchcape, see you next year."
8/16/18,5,"We recently purchased an Evoque from Inchcape Land Rover Preston.

Louis made this an extremely special experience. Nothing was too much trouble for him, we felt very comfortable in his company and he was genuinely excited for us.

Each member of the team that we came across were professional and friendly and we highly recommend this dealership.

A massive THANK YOU Louis!"
8/16/18,5,"The service I received was very professional and all information was provided with the minimum fuss. The showroom itself looks great with booths for customers to use to talk to their salesperson. They prepared my used car really well, removing small inperfections. Highly recommended."
8/16/18,5,"The Salesman, Grant Pilling, whom I have had the pleasure to deal with for my second Mercedes purchase, is very pleasant, efficient and courteous and displays the utmost professionalism. In any future purchases I would not hesitate in contacting Grant again, he is a credit to Mercedes Inchcape Warrington"
8/16/18,4,"Quick and helpful service. Once the price was ironed out, the buying process for the new car was very straight forward."

8/16/18,5,Excellent service by Adrian
8/16/18,4,Very thorough and professional could improve on waiting time particularly when dropping cars off and clients need to get to work
8/16/18,2,"Great for straight forward servicing. Sadly, I've had a few major difficulties recently which is surprising for an advanced manufacturer like BMW, and such a large dealership like Coopers. examples include:
1.A new car that sometimes refuses to change out of 1st gear on startup, and the fault can't be found. (Potentially very dangerous).
2. A parts department that has become too busy to take calls or return voice messages.
3. Three managers who don't return customer calls when asked to.
4. A straight forward tyre warranty claim that has taken over 30 phone calls and emails, and escalation to the branch manager from me to try to get a refund as promised.
Something appears to be very seriously wrong with the management here.

Update. Just seen the reply, no hint of an apology or regret. Disappointing, but not entirely unexpected. Had to chase the payment yet again, which was done while i was on the phone - why on earth didn't they do that the 1st, 2nd .....time. Therefore downrated my scoring to 2 to reflect their performance. Despite all the glam, at the end of the day they don't really care."
8/16/18,5,Very professional and efficient service.
8/16/18,5,Our experience of their service is excellent. Helpful and friendly always a complimentary car clean and good to have the video of the car health check.

8/16/18,5,"Great service, very good customer service."
8/16/18,5,Excellent service the video of the service was a great idea 👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
8/16/18,5,"Great service - friendly, efficient and thorough. The video report on the MOT was an added bonus."
8/15/18,5,Top class from start to finish. Please pass my thanks to BEN for a top class. Performance many. Thanks
8/15/18,5,"Lovely friendly staff, went above and beyond when it came to my car, definitely worth the travel, will definitely be back again in the future :)"
8/15/18,1,"Let me start off by saying this was supposed to be the easiest experience on both ends: us and our sales representative. My husband and I had contacted Inchcape Colchester Sunday around 2PM enquiring about a vehicle that was listed for sale on Autotrader. We were directed to a sales representative named Stephen. Initially, the conversation had started off with formalities and just making sure the vehicle had everything that it was listed to have. We had an unfortunate experience at the other Inchcape location but was intent in purchasing a Tiguan. Stephen reassured us that the vehicle was in pristine condition and had everything that was listed on the advertisement on Autotrader. Upon discussing this more, my husband decided that this was the right car for us and we needed some more definitive numbers. At this point Stephen let us know that he would call us back shortly. An hour later, there was still no call, and they were about to close soon so we went ahead and called. Apparently Stephen was with a customer and could not attend to us over the phone. Which I completely understand, however then he should have directed us to someone else immediately. We ended up going through the same conversation around the vehicle in question with another individual. In any event, the second sales representative had let us know that Stephen will contact us about the discrepancies that were listed on the advertisement. Monday comes and goes and there is no contact that was made by Stephen so my husband called later in the afternoon. My husband decided that this was going to be the vehicle that he wanted to purchase for me and called to make a deposit so he could hold the vehicle in question. Upon calling, Stephen was with a customer so someone gave us a call back and asked him for his credit card details to reserve the car until Saturday. At this point he had let Stephen know that he would be paying for the vehicle in full upon seeing it. We live about an hour away from Colchester and wouldn’t be able to make it until then. In any event, I had made a call on Wednesday to make sure the vehicle had All the extras listed on the advertisement because my husband wanted to pay for the vehicle in full Saturday. The vehicle was listed to have 4,103 miles, a rear camera for park assist, and a 14 way electric adjustable front seats with massage function. When double checking these features, the actual mileage on the car was at 5,700 miles, and had no rear camera nor the electric seats. Despite knowing this, I had let them know we were still interested in the vehicle and would be coming to purchase on Saturday.

Fast forward to Saturday. After an 80 minute drive, we drive into the lot excited to see the car we were about to purchase. It was parked in the front and was in clear view. We were promptly greeted by Stephen who had let us know he had customers and would be with us momentarily but would let us see the car in the mean time. We thanked him for making time for us and we walked out to see the car. Stephen opened the vehicle and went back inside to tend to his other customers. Upon walking up to the vehicle, my husband spots a deep chip in the middle of the bonnet. This chip was so deep you could see the bodywork. In any event we were still excited to see the car inside. Upon opening the driver door, my husband spots that the pedals both the gas and break were incredibly muddy along with the grease stains located on the steering wheel and on the leather panels on the inside of the door. I opened the back seat of the drivers door and see that there are crumbs everywhere in the seats and did not take a seat. Upon opening the boot, there was glitter and mud everywhere in the boot. On the passenger side of the backseat there was sticky remains of chocolate and something syrupy in the door. My favorite part was the McDonalds wrappers and receipts located in the doorwell on the front passenger side. Crumbs were everywhere in the vehicle and it was clear that the car was not cleaned. About 30 minutes later Stephen finally joined us. And our biggest question is why is the car so dirty? The chip on the bonnet, the doors not being aligned, and the dent on the passenger side were all things that should have been fixed but for a vehicle that was supposedly driven by one of the managers was absolutely filthy. Stephen and the individual that had taken our credit card information knew we were coming to purchase said vehicle on Saturday. That means that had from Monday to make sure that the vehicle was at least cleaned. Is this the standard that Inchcape operates? Do you guys have no sense of brand standard? All of this was appalling. Stephen apologized profusely but still couldn’t answer our question. We went inside and let him know we were no longer interested and he got his manager Paul. Paul was an absolutely condescending individual. He was almost laughing our concerns away and did not even want to help us. Why did he come over? Was he the individual who had driven this car? We had driven over an hour away believing that we were going to purchase a vehicle we were excited about in full. Why was our business not appreciated or considered? Do not buy from Colchester from Stephen or from the manager named Paul. What a disgrace to your company. What a disappointment."
8/15/18,4,Very good service and nice staff
8/15/18,5,Great Service from my salesman James Albion & really pleased with the professionalism of the sales team!!
8/15/18,5,"This company we’re professional,attentive,helpful,communicative,an alround pleasant experience"
8/15/18,1,"Cooper Teesside! Absolute joke of a company who employ people who can't even do the basic of life skills.

Car was damaged whilst my car was with them, they fixed it and then caused even more damage to the rest of the car.
Service advisors are rude and shouldn't be in a customer facing role if they can't provide the basics of customer service..
Cooper Teeside have a huge reputation of damaging client vehicles!!!
BE WARNED

I would now rather travel 2 hours to different bmw dealership to avoid dealing with cooper teesside bunch of incompetent jobsworths"
8/15/18,3,"We booked a 20.000 miles service ,that I was previously advised takes around 2.5 hours . After dropping the car off at 8am we was called and told that it would only be ready at 5pm , we arrived at 4.45pm to collect and was told it wasnt ready to wait in the waiting area . The car was finally brought out to us at 5.25pm and was told the computer took a long time to update .
Belive or not !!!!!"
8/15/18,5,"Everything went smoothly, from collection of the car to a comprehensive report of all the checks that have been made, and advisories clearly marked. Everyone involved from Toyota was extremely helpful. Really happy and impressed with the service!"
8/15/18,5,"Everyone I have come into contact with have been very friendly, helpful and informative. My car needed an update on a recall item from Audi, it was collected, fixed, washed and returned all free of charge! I will definitely be using this garage again."
8/15/18,5,Very good service
8/15/18,5,"Service was excellent. Staff very friendly and professional. Even though I didn’t book for them to pick up and drop off, this was arranged for me when I requested on the day with no hustle at all. I will highly recommend toyota Inchcape Basingstoke branch to everyone. They r simply the best"
8/15/18,5,I found the health check my Mercedes was very further Health check quite pleased Thanks
8/15/18,5,"A really straight forward transaction, no fuss, no need to haggle. Thank you"
8/15/18,5,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE WHICH I RECEIVED FROM MARK WHEN WE ORDERED OUR NEW CAR.MARK SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WITH US AND WENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS OPTIONS IN GREAT DETAIL.MARK WAS ALSO PATIENT WITH US AND EXPLAINED THINGS CLEARLY.
8/15/18,5,Did what they said they would do. Car serviced and MOT’d and returned clean
8/15/18,3,"When I phoned and booked I very clearly requested a Service B for my Freelander 2. I was told they are now referred to under a new system. I said I don't mind what you call it, but that is what I want.
When I left it I was told it would be getting a 9th service or something similar. I said as long as it what I was quoted for and asked fo that would be fine.
It wasn't. When I was called when nearing completion, I was then told the service equivalent of what I expected was £611, not the very optimistic £475 I was expecting. To their credit, they did facilitate the fuel filter change without additional cost.
I was told when they called, the discs and pads needing changing. This was not entirely unexpected. However the bank loan required to cover it was something of a shock. Especially as I have found a reputable company to fit all 4 corners with quality (German) parts for less than the price of the fronts alone! I know workshop costs are high, but making over £600 profit fitting £200 of parts is grotesque profiteering on a job that books at about 20 minutes a wheel!

Incidentally, if you own a TD4 Freelander or similar, buy a EGR blanking plate for £3.50 on ebay. Fit it in 20 mins and save 10% on your fuel bills as well as improving every aspect of performance! Still can't believe just what a bargain it was."
8/15/18,5,"Excellent booking system, staff were amazing, timely, very knowledgeable and hospitable (coffee) - Lauren was great and my car came back valeted too, what more can you ask for!"
8/15/18,4,"My car was picked up and delivered back to me at the pre-arranged time by a gentleman who made sure every little detail was attended to. I was very impressed by the attention my car received and the excellent condition it was in when returned.

8/15/18,5,"First class experience.

Dropped off my car, the required work was carried out and ready for collection at the agreed time. The staff were courteous at all times.

That's what I expect and that's what they delivered."
8/15/18,3,Arrived at 8am for car service. Asked them to get it ready for 3pm as I had another appointment later that afternoon. Was after 4pm when it was ready and there was no time for it to be cleaned as I was already late by then. Will try a different dealer next time.
8/14/18,5,"I recently purchased my car from Inchscape Land Rover from Chester. I had a brilliant experience. Andrew Haynes is excellent, keeps to his time, knowledgable with the cars, excellent customer service, polite and great manners. I would highly recommend going to inchscape in Chester to purchase your car. Thank you for making my experience memorable! Best wishes"
8/14/18,5,They were very helpful in every way . With a great service
8/14/18,5,"This review is for MOT test and service items at Swindon branch on Monday 13 August 2018. Expert assistance as usual from service advisor (Emma Y. on this occasion). Work was dealt with quickly and car was ready by the agreed time. Car was clean and technician provided a video of car in the service bay. Final bill was exactly as agreed, and amount was acceptable for the work done. I have used the Swindon branch many times before and will continue to do so."
8/14/18,5,"Excellent, everyone was very helpful and they found the ideal car for me very quickly. Highly recommend!"
8/14/18,4,"Overall, pleased with the work that was done but just a few little niggles, mainly to do with communication:
1. Car pick-up time was booked for 09:30-12:30 but was actually after 14:00.
2. At 13:00, I rang to query the above &, although the lady I spoke to on Reception was very polite, I was suddenly put on hold for 2 minutes, without explanation & transferred to another lady, who told me the driver should have been there by now, that she'd contact him & call me back.
3. Didn't receive a call back.
4. 17:05 - Call to say car had had a free safety check (which I was thankful for) & that the printout would be on its way back with the driver shortly. Car actually arrived at mine at 18:45, when the journey should only have taken about 35 minutes. I had to postpone an appointment due to the delay.
5. I was emailed a video, apparently showing the safety points which had been raised but all three of the links in the email led to a 'this video is no longer available' page.

That said, the work was done for free & I accept I am a 'picky' person but still feel these points needed to be mentioned."
8/14/18,5,Very good service.
8/14/18,5,"A good experience, if having the car serviced could be classed, as a good experience?! Comfortable lounge, drinkable coffee and efficient staff. Reasonably priced too."
8/14/18,2,"Not impressed ar all receptionist very polite but after that nothing I can say about the welcome or service .No privacy offered just met by a person who was only interest in telling me how much it would cost and it will be ready in approx 1.5 Hours .
On return for my car I explained I had come to collect please take a seat some 20 mins later again I explained that all I want to do is pay for my car a young girl came out with a credit card machine and told me the cost I then paid in front of everybody else she did apologise for the delay there was no chance for any questions I felt a second class citizen perhaps it's because I didn't purchase it from yourselves or because it is a lease car .When my car is due for my next service I will go somewhere else.
Very disappointed Geoffrey Rogers"
8/14/18,5,"As always, a great service from start to finish!"
8/14/18,5,"Friendly professional staff
They know their cars every question is answered with knowledge
Love my new car
Great coffee too!!!"
8/14/18,5,Trustworthy and reliable
8/14/18,5,"An excellent job, carried out in a timely and efficient manner."
8/14/18,4,"Having never dealt with the company I was very impressed with the service I received, face to face, via email and ‘phone. Everything was carried out in a friendly but professional manner & I am thrilled with my purchase."
8/14/18,4,"Almost got it right

Happy with the service in the car and the pick up and delivery.

As last year the car was cleaned poorly including leaving litter in the back of the car. The inside particularly was not done very well.

On the phone, I checked that the Mercedes Me was all done and would be in the car but it was not so I will have to contact the garage again."
8/14/18,5,"Very happy with service and overall experience, would highly recommend and will be using again in future."
8/14/18,5,"Very pleased, communication was great, staff were very friendly and informative."
8/14/18,5,"Same day repair, excellent service from Cooper.
Disappointed with reliability of BMW 530 and also cost of repairs is very high."
8/14/18,5,I visited BMW Chelmsford yesterday and once again received excellent customer service from all the staff i encountered. I would not hesitate to recommend to friends and family .
8/14/18,2,"I went to BMW Teesside for break oil filling and I found that the service I received was not good enough. The lady who dealt did not seem patient and did not seem to listen what I was explaning. Her expression looked as she was busy and shots to cut in conversation.

This is our 6th BMW and found that BMW service has not been improved whenever i went to showroom for service. Thinking of changing to other brands."
8/14/18,5,"It was my first time using Inchcape UK Southampton and I must say, I was very impressed!!! From start to finish, I found the staff to be very helpful and polite. My car has just had it's first service and now it goes better then ever. I also inquired about purchasing a new vehicle, the salesman was not pushy in the slightest. I would highly recommend Inchcape and will certainly be using them in the future."
8/14/18,1,Shockingly rude aggressive customer service guy I was horrified at his attitude would never go there again what an awful experience
8/14/18,5,"Always an excellent experience, but improved by collection and delivery from home. The addition of a video of the service in progress is an added bonus."
8/14/18,5,"As usual first class attention from Louise Parsons and Claire Hart, Service Advisors. Also James Richardson, Sales Executive, for his help in arranging a test drive on the date of my car service."
8/14/18,4,Employees were very professional and helpful.
8/13/18,5,Excellent customer service. Honesty is remarkable.
8/13/18,4,I traded in my M235i for an M240i at Cooper Gobham. The price was competitive and the transaction was made easy by Becky who was great to work with. I've only done a couple hundred miles in the new motor but I'm absolutely besotted with it and find myself going out of evening drives just to experience this incredible driving machine.
8/13/18,1,One of my worst experiences with a dealership. Rang for a whole week to try and book my car in for some warranty work. Finally received a call back and booked the car in. They could not fix the problem and saying they cannot locate the fault even after I explained a number of times. Sills lost colour on the car and they refused to cover this under warranty. Finally to add to this insult they tried to charge me a diagnostic fee. Got a card left in my car to ask if I would like to sell them the vehicle. Rang them up a number of times and no reply as they are busy. Will be looking to sell this Audi A8 21 edition and going back to a BMW.
8/13/18,5,"Excellent service, I could not fault anything"
8/13/18,5,Great service
8/13/18,5,"Just Purchased a new car at Inchcape warrington . Service was excellent and Tony Kelly did a great job in understanding what I needed and finding the car which was right for us .
Thanks

Alan McAulay"
8/13/18,5,Fantastic service !!
8/13/18,5,Excellent helpful and reliable service
8/13/18,4,"I spoke to a number of dealerships searching for the right car. Most took the enquiry and never followed it up. I live 250 miles from the Preston branch but as Alan Wood was very helpful and eventually found the car i was looking for i was happy to make the journey.

The handover day was quick and hassle free and an enjoyable experience.

Thanks"
8/13/18,5,"My experience from start to finish at Inchcape Norwich was fantastic.

When I arrived I was offered a drink and a seat whilst I waited for a sales person to meet me, when he arrived he was friendly and approachable. We spoke about what I was looking for before he valued my vehicle that I was wishing to part exchange, once this was complete we then went for a test drive. During the drive I felt at ease and the car was explained to me in more detail, Glen took me on a route which included a variety of road surfaces and conditions so that I was able to understand how the car handled on roads other than smooth tarmac.

Upon returning to the showroom we discussed further what I was looking to buy and a quote was generated for me, I was surprised at how good the quote was and accepted without hesitation.

A vehicle was found for me with my specifications and within a week I was collecting the vehicle from the show room.

Every person I encountered from the receptionist to the New car retail manager (Noel) were welcoming and friendly. I can honestly say my experience was miles apart from what I thought it would be. I felt under no pressure to go forward with the sale and because of this it made it a very easy decision to do so.

I would 100% recommend Norwich Mini to anyone."
8/13/18,5,good service car wash not the best but apart from that good
8/13/18,5,Always provide an excellent service
8/13/18,5,"I had a very good experience. Everyone was very friendly and provided me with a comfortable area to work in whilst my car was being serviced.

Good value for money"
8/13/18,5,"What a fantastic experience from start to finish. The deal its self was the best you could find anywhere online, but with the added advantage of a first class main dealer experience. The assumption that you will pay more through a top dealer certainly wasn't true in my case. The Sales person Becky was fantastic, as was Anthony who was Manager. Every detail was considered, i was kept fully informed at every stage, no pressure at all, just first class service which far exceeded my expectations. The experience given to me by BMW, Becky and Anthony actually added to the excitement of receiving my new car, ill be going straight back to them for my next one."
8/13/18,4,As always BMW were inflexible on price but their service cannot be faulted. Thanks Garry for you politeness and help.
8/13/18,1,"If you need to buy a VW I do not recommend Inchcape (Southend).

The facts of my case ... price agreed for car in stock (with around 1800 miles on the clock) and deposit paid, with delivery later that week or next. A few days later informed that: (1) the car would not be available for minimum of 4 months, (2) a firm delivery time cannot be provided, and (3) the mileage would be more (but the amount could not be quantified) as the car will now be used as a demonstrator.

They were lightening fast to take the deposit, and incredibly slow thereafter. There were no reasonable attempts at all to remedy the situation, and no response from the sales manager of the branch (Southend).

Edit 15/8/18 - the car that was reserved has mysteriously been re-listed for sale, and Inchcape are silent about returning my deposit. BEWARE BUYING FROM INCHCAPE!"
8/13/18,5,"Fantastic service. I was dealing with Alan Wood and nothing was too much trouble. Huge dealership, lots of stock, Alan was happy to stay late to ensure we were able to test drive the car I was interested in and it was ready for collection at a time that suited us. Highly recommended."
8/13/18,5,"Excellent customer service, no issues/ difficulty. Car was collected on time, service completed, and returned. Would recommend."
8/13/18,4,"As usual very efficient on most things.. However I have asked at least twice if not more for the panel with airbag key , passenger side to be refitted .. noted on job but not done ! And still waiting a quote for repair ! Frustrating as otherwise good service and pleasant staff.."
8/13/18,1,"I bought my dream car from Mercedes in Liverpool, I was recently looking to upgrade so advertised my car and got a buyer, only to find after the buyer did a HPI check there was a millage discrepancy!

Cut a long story short Mercedes Benz in Liverpool had messed about with the millage and taken 4,444 miles off the clock just before they mot’d for me to pick it up. Been down to Mercedes and I am just being fobbed off, I have lost the buyer who was paying the full £17,000 asking price and although Mercedes gave admitted there is a error some were I have been informed I can’t sell the car on because of the illegal millage. Mercedes told me they can put it right but will take 10 weeks

Knowing I can’t sell it they told me they would buy it off me. Really to cover there tracks. Told me they would give me my full asking price only to find out this is only if I buy a new car from them. They know I am stuck with the car and keep fobbing me off. They have today told me they will give me £14,000

I am so angry that this mess is nothing to do with me and Mercedes knows this knowing I can’t sell the car they are offering me sick a low price! If your buying and car from Inchcape Mercedes Liverpool check all the millage checks out!"
8/13/18,5,"I was thoroughly satisfied with the first service of my Toyota Yaris Hybrid.
The report I received showed all the checks and changes that had been completed satisfactorily."
8/12/18,1,"I’ve been looking to change my car recently with two cars in particular being in the running a 2016 Mercedes E-Class and a 2015 Audi A7.

For the Audi I enquired online on a Saturday afternoon to Audi Macclesfield and received a phone call within approx. 30 mins from one of the salesman saying the car had been sold - so far so good. As I was travelling out in that direction the next day I called in on the off chance that I could view the car anyway, just to see the rare grey leather interior. I was helped by the same salesman who had called the night before, who suggested that the car wasn’t onsite but kindly offered to let me sit in another car they had on sale, which I did. Unfortunately on returning to the showroom the salesman was otherwise engaged so I spoke to reception to say we had to leave but that I’d be in touch. As I was driving away the salesman came out and flagged me down, apologised that he was so busy but the other two salesman who were supposed to be that day had called in sick, joking that that had been out together the night before. I asked him to call be and gave a brief description of what I was looking for. I’m still waiting for that contact several weeks later.

Fast forward to this week where I’d made an appointment with Mercedes Liverpool (via online chat from my holiday in France) to view a car at 11am this morning, a 90 mile round trip. I’d made the appointment for this time, in discussion via online chat, specifically to give the dealer time to call me if the car had been sold the day before. I arrived at 10.55 and entered a showroom devoid of staff but with a number of customers walking around and one waiting at reception. The person waiting at reception joked to me that he hoped I had plenty of time as he’d been waiting to speak to someone for 15 mins. 5 mins later someone with a badge walked past several waiting customers without a word and went upstairs. Maybe another 5 mins later a rather harassed looking gentleman came to reception and spoke to the person in front of me. He then came back to speak to my wife and I whereupon he went somewhere behind the scenes to get Jake (not Robert Friday who I was scheduled to meet as he was evidently unavailable). Jake came out and introduced himself and then went on to apologise that the car had been sold yesterday, to which I responded “why couldn’t you have called to let me know?”, “because I didn’t find out until this morning” was his answer. I then asked to speak to the manager (whose name I can’t recall), but a very tall gentleman. When asked the same question said “because we sold the car this morning”, when challenged on the inconsistency of the message between him and Jake he didn’t answer the challenge but simply restated his previous response. I’m afraid I was furious at this point and told the manager I simply didn’t believe him. There was no conciliatory language, no offer of even a coffee over which he may have attempted to regain my trust / taken details for any future cars that may come along - just a shrugging apology that appeared to convey no empathy or desire to win a potential future sale.

I’m afraid my business will not be going in Inchcape’s direction."
8/12/18,3,"I decided to book my A3 into Swindon Audi as I work in Swindon and thought they could carry out my vehicles first service. Booking etc was easy and straight forward and it was arranged that my car would be picked up from my place of work and then delivered back to me for 17:00 as this is when I finish work. I was told my car would be picked up between 08:00 and 11:00 and delivered back in time for when I finish work.
After the viewing the convenient Audi Cam and speaking to someone to pay the bill over the phone, I assumed my car would be back for me to travel home and attend an appointment which I had arranged on my way home.
At 17:19 I phoned the garage asking where my car was and I was told the driver left 20 minutes ago and was probably stuck in traffic. For me this was not good enough as I was told my car would be delivered back to me for 17:00. My car finally arrived at 17:35 meaning I missed my appointment. The customer service is good and everyone I spoke with was polite and professional. Just a shame that after my money was paid the service slipped and I was left inconvenienced. Will go back to Bath Audi next time as that’s where I bought the car from and never had an issue with them."
8/12/18,5,"I went in to see Harriett the sales person & subsequently spoke to TIM the business manager, what s breath of fresh they both were. Nothing was too much trouble at all for Harriett and both her & Tim were very thorough and informative, explaining every little detail of the car I chose, the finance and the part exchange process too.

Thoroughly recommend them and Harriett had just sold my niece s car too.

Thank you and I look forward to picking up my new car verysoon"
8/11/18,2,"To say I'm underwhelmed with Cooper Croydon is an understatement.
A vehicle I have owned for less than a week developed a fault, I suppose that can happen but didn't expect it of a just over year old X1, and was booked in the following week.
The car went in this Wednesday for the I drive to be fixed, and admittedly some paint touch ups which would entail us being without the car a bit longer. We were advised a couple of days maybe three but we would be contacted and advised.
It's either a miracle or pot luck if you're able to get through on the telephone. Three times the switchboard number rang out and cut off, and when I did get through the service number was ignored and rang out too.
I put myself through this telephonic hell because I didn't receive the promised call from the service centre about the progress on the car.
However, this lack of call became self evident when I did get to speak to the service person. The vehicle had been there nearly two full working days and hasn't even been looked at.
What's the point of booking a car in if you're unable to look at it because you're too busy?
When we took the car in on Wednesday morning the queue for the service desk was nearly out the door!
I predict that I am going to be without my vehicle for several more days yet and am already regretting buying my car there.
I had high expectations of BMW ownership which have been completely ruined.
And before I get the glib standard reply, and am encouraged to contact inchcape, how about you buy back the car for what I paid for it and I'll put my two weeks of ownership down to experience? I am that unhappy.

Since posting this review and contacting Inchcape the following three things have happened.
1) Inchcape have failed to respond to my email, therefore we can't 'work towards a resolution'.
2) Despite being very clear on what needed addressing to achieve my satisfaction on the minor paint issues, on picking up the vehicle today and least two have not been done. I'm now faced with another visit to dealership and be without the car for at least another day due to incompetence.
3) At least the IDrive has been replaced, albeit after seven days in the workshop.

Things are not improving"
8/11/18,2,"They made me wait an hour after my service + mot because they lost my keys. They left the car with streak marks everywhere after their 'cleaning'. Nobody apologised either. Terrible service, would not recommend."

Easy to book my mini in for a service , work was completed within the time slot and at the price that I was quoted at time of booking . Staff were friendly and helpful as always , my car was given back to me clean and shiny inside and out after being valeted which I think is a very nice touch , all part of the mini experience."
8/10/18,5,Great service
8/10/18,5,"Great service . After being told on the phone that they would need my car all day they just took 2 hours so i could wait for my car and return home same morning. Farhad Ahmed was very efficient and explained everything. Very happy with the service thank you x

8/10/18,5,"A relaxed, unpressurised experience. David Flynn was most helpful and easy to relate to. He gave information in a clear concise manner and listened carefully to our questions giving precise answers which were very easy to understand.

Thank you ,

8/10/18,5,"My car needed a software update and BMW at Reading were so efficient at organising this for me
My courtesy car was waiting ready for me and with fuel too, they made everything easy. My car was ready on time and beautifully cleaned.

8/10/18,4,"Pulled into Inchcape in Southampton with a sick Jaguar XK8 2000 at 2.30pm. Asked the young lady on Reception ( Gabrielle) is there any chance of looking at my Jaguar as it was miss fireing. and giving me a Reduced performance reading.
Give me a moment she replied came back and said give the Technician half an hour and he would be able to check it but might not be able to fix it today.
Within 20 minutes car was in the workshop after half an hour Steve Brewer the Technician returns tells me the problem 1 of the coils had gone down would you like me to replace it thank you.
Car comes out of Service department with a Electronic Vehicle Health Check costing nothing extra.
The cost of the repair was very reason, and I was on my way back to Sussex.
I could not be more happier with the service I recieved from this company.
Thank You

8/9/18,5,"I bought my nearly new pepper white mini convertible from mini cooper Cobham and received excellent service from the salesman Connor Fox as well as the store manager. Connor found my chosen colour (without racing stripes) in a matter of days, then I test drove it. It took some getting used to a more powerful car than I had formerly owned but I went ahead with the purchase and drove it home which included an unplanned emergency stop just outside the showroom as a young child stepped out in front of me (she's still alive!) I've made significant progress since then and hope to continue to do so. Otherwise I see myself gaining many years of enjoyment and use from it.
Many thanks!"
8/9/18,5,I would recommend this dealership to anyone that is looking to purchase a MINI. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The staff members working there go out of their way to deliver quality customer service. Thank you to Charlie for making my journey of purchasing my first ever car smooth and easy.

Great communication and use of online resources.
Fantastic all round experience."

8/9/18,5,First class attention and service.
8/9/18,5,Great experience at Inchcape Land Rover. No pushy sales tactics and the whole experience was very pleasant. They even came and picked me up to collect my new car. Excellent service from Steve and Graham. Can’t recommend them enough.
8/9/18,1,while you wait service - customer care non existent - 2 hour overrun and no communication. plus filthy car at the end despite a valet promise.
8/9/18,5,"Excellent service, our car was collected and returned to us within the identified timescale."
8/9/18,4,"Love the new location and building, won't be going back to Manchester!
Like the idea that they bring car to you whilst undercover, so you can get in car dry even if raining."

8/9/18,5,"Excellent quick, efficient and curteous service."
8/9/18,5,The service is always great at Inchcape Bolton and I have never had a bad experience. The staff are always lovely and willing to help with anything :)
8/9/18,3,"The problem I experienced is that the email with the details of work that might need doing arrived after the car had been returned so, I would have to re-book the car in if I wanted to have the work done. Understandable if it is a big job, but if it is something minor that could have been done on the spot a waste of both our time ?"
8/9/18,5,"Brilliant service, fast and efficient. Would definitely recommend, & big thanks to Zelda :)"

8/9/18,5,"Bought a two year old BMW 2L Gran Tourismo 3 series just a month ago, not from Coopers / Inchcape Chelmsford. Despite all the main BMW company allegations of the thousands of checks they say they their approved dealers do as part of the Approved BMW Used Car scheme I reported a constant ringing noise to the dealership from whom I had purchased the car. After monitoring it for two weeks I spoke to Coopers BMW Genius Mike at Colchester, excellent service and advice. Booked car into Chelmsford. Receptionist very friendly and Laura on the Service Desk was also the same. Took a drive in the car with their senior techie Tim who amazingly identified the source of the aggravating sound immediately. Very laid back clever guy and a thoroughly nice bloke to boot. Car booked in mid Sept to resolve the issue. Have to say everyone I spoke to a Coopers have been very jovial friendly peopls so I have no hesitation in highly recommending them"

8/9/18,5,I have just brought a car from this garage and found them helpful and knowledgeable.
8/8/18,5,I had a great experience from my first conversation with Steve Pike over the telephone to finally meeting him when collecting my car. Nothing was too much trouble even repetition of questions by myself to Steve he was more than happy to break the specific detail down for me into components I could manage and understand so I understood everything about my car and the deal he did for me. I have 2 other dealerships much more local to me but after my husband received poor service in both dealerships I can honestly say my experience at Inchcape has restored his faith in Land Rover as a brand and I won't hesitate to recommend Inchcape Chester to my friends many of whom are already existing Land Rover customers.
8/8/18,2,"Having had my car booked in for well over a month on a recall so when I arrived at the garage I was told the didn’t have any spares to carry ou the work. ( not a very happy customer waisted day, 20 odd mile round trip ) after many calls I spoke with the Manager who was very helpful, booked in again two weeks later arrived again told no spares. I told the young lady I would wait and speak with manager when she arrived. 10 or 15 min later another young lady came running out to tell me they had found the the bits required and the work was carried out in less than 30 min. Not really a good experience."
8/8/18,4,"Very good customer service, service completed on car, excellent facilities available to allow me to wait and work whilst service taking place.
Only downside was the lack of update on how long service would take; it took 1 hour longer due to update of software, however no communication from staff on this. As a result, I was nearly 2 hours behind and late to a meeting.
I would recommend and visit this showroom again despite the above."
8/8/18,4,Great service. Quick and everything it said it would be
8/8/18,5,"Simple service booked but took car on the wrong day according to the garage but found a loan car fitted it in and sorted us out. Might have been my mistake, might have been theirs no one knows. Great service, thanks for finding a loan car with no notice."
8/8/18,5,Excellent assistance and timing of the car service.
8/8/18,5,"Excellent customer service, very happy with all aspects of MB Derby"
8/8/18,5,"Problem with the wiring loom resulting in loss of near-side lighting. Booked in under warranty with loan car replacement. Big, tricky and tedious job that took the best part of 3 days to complete.
Returned valeted and everything now works perfectly.

Many thanks."
8/8/18,5,"Easy to book, swift collection, reasonable price, helpful staff

Love the video of the car - nice to see how everything is looking"
8/7/18,5,Absolutely fantastic service from all members of the team involved
8/7/18,5,"Very good service at this dealership. Welcoming, polite with no hard sell. They’ll look at every option available to you without being pushy. Good after sales aswel. Wouldn’t expect anything less from a Mercedes main dealer."
8/7/18,4,Good service and support as you would expect from a VW main dealer.
8/7/18,5,Excellent service provided by all staff at BMW Malton my vehicle was pristine inside and out Great to know that all aspects have been inspected and guaranteed safe
8/7/18,5,"Vehicle in for a minor service
All work carried out in a timely manner
Received a text and phone call to confirm that the vehicle was ready for collection before midday
Staff were aĺl exceĺlent, very professional and well mannered
Couldn't be faulted
Thank you
Kind regards

8/7/18,2,"Unhelpful and argumentative service receptionist, condescending & rude when challenged, no thank yous, or attempt to recover situation. Call from service manager hasn’t left me feeling any better about returning."
8/7/18,4,"Car was picked up for service at the end of the three hour window, apart from that the service was highly efficient and the car was returned with the service and remedial safety work completed satisfactorily."
8/7/18,5,Very friendly and welcoming staff. Kept updated on progress and car returned clean and on time.
8/7/18,5,"A VERY EFFICIENT AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FROM ALL AT INCHAPE.
I WILL BE RETURNING NO DOUBT AT SOME FUTURE DATE."
8/7/18,5,"Allyson in the service department was a great help and helped my understand what my BMW i3 needed to be fixed.

I can not thank Allyson enough for the help she provided.

Many thanks"
8/7/18,1,"Service and professionalism akin to a back street garage. Lack of clarity on price lead to a 39% hike in cost; and then the employee who delivered my car back to me couldn't explain the work that had been done to the vehicle.

Unfortunately Jaguar's after sales service is seriously lacking. I've tried two dealerships now and they're both poor. Good cars, poor after sales service. Think carefully before buying a Jag!"
8/7/18,5,Excellent service. Fast and very friendly
8/7/18,5,"A friendly professional service, everything explained and a great coffee provided"
8/7/18,4,"Service date arranged very quickly.Actual service was good, car returned washed & interior very clean. Five stars for that but the dealership need to consider making arrangements for vehicle to be left overnight prior to service date. No keysafe available & the dealership has no post letter box ! All staff leave at 6pm"
8/6/18,4,Car fine. Staff great. Really well washed too so a huge thank you for that. Asked about the tyre mousse which I used last November and am waiting for an answer as to when a replacement will be available as one was not last November. Small point but could be vital. Oh and the person named on the email is my wife. This car is one operated by my employer driven by myself. Minor points. Still really happy to use this garage for my BMW.
8/6/18,2,"I just had my car serviced with Mercedes Benz Leicester but the customer service was absolutely appalling! The lady at the front desk is so rude! I phoned the first time to book my car in asked to be transferred to the services department, the receptionist put me through to the wrong department and then line got cut off. I rang back for the second time and the same person answers and I said you put me through to a wrong department she then realised and said the service booking lines were down and she will take my details and get someone to phone me back. Bearing in mind I am at work thinking I need to keep an eye just in case I get a call. No phone call at all during that day! I rang back the next day and demanded to speak with someone as i was on my lunch break again the same rude lady answers and tuts on the phone. I finally managed to book my car in for service and I was told even with my confirmation email that the day before my service, I will get a phone call confirming that everything is ok in terms of the collection of my car. I did not recieve a call. Only the day of my service was when I got a call from the driver stating he is on his way to collect my car. The customer service at Leicester needs to be alot better I pay for a service plan and every single time I book my car in I have to mention that the fluids are never topped up to their required levels I only seem to be getting feedback about the wear and tear of my vehicle which is a cost I have to pay but when it comes to the service of the car certain things are not even filled to the requirements."
8/6/18,4,"Staff polite and friendly, work undertaken on time and took as long as advised at outset. Feedback after very good. Shame they don’t offer to clean the car like they used to."
8/6/18,2,"Bought a mercedes cls from inchcape mercedes coventry, the car didn't have much of a service history which wasn't discussed whilst negotiating,didn't bother servicing it as promised when negotiating until I had specifically checked and insisted, otherwise friendly staff and nice new building."
8/6/18,5,Fast and efficient service on a call back
8/6/18,5,"I took my car to Inchcape Mercedes of Derby for a routine service, and was blown away with the level of professional service received. I was welcomed by friendly front of house staff and instantly seen by my contact who was very informative and also friendly. There were no hidden costs or unexpected charges, so all in all a very pleasant experience. I’ll definitely be using them again."
8/6/18,4,"I went to Cooper BMW Colchester, because of a extremely poor experience at their Chelmsford Branch. Ricky Clarke at Colchester was found to be knowledgeable, efficient and wanted to help in my search for a vehicle."
8/6/18,5,"I really like how Toyota services my car. So much so, I've just bought another Toyota. There's no difficulty arranging the car's collection and return, it's not too expensive; and I really, really like the video they send showing my car and the areas that require attention. I also like how the old part may be returned to me if it is reasonable to do so. By being so open, I feel reassured that I'm not being taken advantage of."
8/6/18,5,very helpful staff on reception and sales. great choice and quality of cars. I would buy from inchcape again
8/6/18,5,"Excellent,professional and well organised"
8/6/18,5,My car was recalled for a safety check. Booked into Cheshire Oaks with courtesy car and they provided a nearly new top spec C class. All the arrangements worked perfectly. Phil the Service Manager was professional and helpful. They valeted my car and sent text when it was ready. All good.
8/6/18,1,Shocking - booked in to identify a fault but picked the car up at the end of the day and was told I’d have to book it back it as they only did a ‘diagnostic check’ but didn’t actually diagnose the fault. They also failed to correct the overdue service light when in actual fact the service wasn’t due - this puts me off getting another BMW as Cooper are the only dealer I Teesside.
8/6/18,4,very helpful staff
8/6/18,5,"Was in for MOT. Great service, washed car in and out. Liked the video sent to email. Tom in service did a great job."
8/6/18,5,"Sales team are very Helpful & have a professional attitude.
Bought many cars over the years and have recommended family and friends who in turn have bought numerous cars each."
8/6/18,5,"First time taking a car for a manufacturer service, previously I've has older and lower value cars so I've just used local garages but felt keeping up with the Audi only service history on this car would help keep some value in it. Very happy indeed, lovely people and very helpful. I'd originally phoned for advice around costings and the girl on the phone was very helpful in providing the info I wanted. Once I was into the showroom the receptionist(?) and the lady that saw me were both also very helpful in answering my questions. I was warned by friends about the costs of taking a car for a service back at a manufacturer, but was pleasantly surprised at the cost under the service package, coming out much the same as going to a local garage. Good information received post-service from the gentleman I spoke with, advising me on tyre wear (mm), break wear (%) etc as well as bits to keep an eye on. All in all very happy."
8/6/18,3,AMAZING ! very helpful & friendly service at Mini Reading
8/6/18,5,Very helpful staff get the job done and you can get on your way would highly recommend if your wanting to buy a mini or just need work done in your current mini .
8/6/18,5,"During the purchasing of my car I dealt with 3 different salesmen.All were
polite and efficient.I was impressed with the level of service.My thanks to
Oliver for his help and assistance."
8/6/18,1,"Do not take your Mercedes here!! Took my A200 to Mercedes Benz Warrington for a basic problem with a wheel bearing for them to then tell me i needed £1100 worth of ""urgent"" repairs...to which i bluntly refused as i didn't feel they were needed. Low and behold, upon taking my car for an MOT and Service a week later at a local mercedes specialist they found no issues with the vehicle whatsoever! Overpriced and trying to con people for work that simply does not need doing! Definitely will not be returning!!"
8/6/18,5,"As ever, the repair was quickly and efficiently carried out. Car returned cleaned both in and out."
8/5/18,5,"Great people ,great service . Many thanks"
8/5/18,5,"Excellent, efficient service. Thank you."
8/5/18,5,Excellent service. Particularly impressed by Andrew Hutton who was aware that it would be helpful to me if the car was available for collection earlier than quoted time and this was achieved.
8/5/18,1,"Inchcape UK make owning a Mercedes a Bad experience

Staff were polite and welcoming but as a Company the whole experience of owning a Mercedes has been a disaster.
Every experience I've had with the company so far except for the selling part has been a bad one."
8/4/18,4,"All , very good ."
8/4/18,2,"I booked my car in for its 1st service and I had requested that the back tyres be swapped over with the front. At the time of the booking I was told that would be OK, but on the day I was told that they couldn’t do this because of a coding issue. I don’t feel valued as a customer and feel fobbed off as I know this service is available at extra cost which I was willing to pay as this was done on the last car service on another vehicle which was the same make and model. I have escalated this matter to the Service Manager and I hope that this will be resolved as my usual experience with Mercedes Benz is always exceptional."
8/4/18,5,"Had a great experience purchasing my 1st Jaguar F type.
Ashley Brear was very informative and helpful through every stage of the purchasing process.

Definitely recommend!
Thanks again Karen"
8/4/18,5,Sales advisor was very helpful and sorted my car well
8/4/18,1,"I have never experienced such poor customer service with anything I purchased.
Once the deposit was paid the customer care was and communication was non existent. When we visited to complete paper work we were kept waiting for long periods. When we arrived, extremely excited, to collect the the car again we were left waiting and totally ignored for 40 minutes to be told the car wasn't there. No one cared enough or could be bothered to call us and tell us before hand. Things never really improved after either.
My experience was completely opposite to my brothers who bought and Audi and was treated as a VIP. I wish I had gone there!"
8/4/18,1,"BMW 3 series was taken in for recall, OBD cover was left in centre console having done the diagnostics. After leaving the dealership and making my way onto the M25 I started to hear a whirring noise from the rear drivers side tyre, pulled into the next services and they had neglected to notice that the tyre pressure was at a measly 0.3 PSI.... but they had noticed that I needed two new front tyres funnily enough (money, money, money), so thanks BMW for letting me drive and unsafe car and I have now purchased and replaced all four tyres as it ruined the rear one.... needless to say BMW Coopers didn't get my money though!!

Left a message with BMW for a call back and its now 5 days with no return call, safe to say this is the first and last time I will be using a BMW main dealer, if you're not making them money, like most main dealers they couldn't give a hoot!!"
8/4/18,5,"Sydney hasn’t been with the dealership long but she was very helpful as were all the other staff. All enquiries were dealt with promptly and professionally, wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them."
8/4/18,5,Took a long time to get the part needed to fix my Audi - it's still under warranty - but the service on the day was excellent .
8/4/18,5,"Excellent service from start to finish. Becky was very knowledgeable, helpful and kept us informed throughout. Would not hesitate to use or recommend this dealership. No haggling or back and forth. Fantastic customer service."
8/4/18,5,"Very courteous and friendly staff. Comfortable waiting area in a well presented showroom.
Quick service and valet while u wait."
8/3/18,5,"From the time we made our appointment to the time we picked up our serviced, valeted and MOT passed mini, Mini Cooper of Norwich was outstanding in customer service. The fact the courtesy car was a mini clubman was a real treat for my wife in her birthday week.

We could not praise them enough."
8/3/18,5,"Jaguar F-Pace, 2.0D 180ps AWD R-Sport 8 speed Auto, ex demo.

We located the specification and vehicle finish we wanted with ease via the Jaguar approved used website.

Having traveled 4 hours from Poole in Dorset to Norwich we were helped by Blake Jarvis - easy to get on with, open and to the point but not pushy quite unlike a recent experience at our local Jaguar outlet.

Happy with the price agreed and part exchange allowance made for our 8 year old Audi.

Vehicle well prepared and delivered to Poole in Dorset by Andy with a full tank of fuel who took as long as we needed to understand the complexities of the controls etc. before taking our old vehicle away.

Some say the elements of the interior finishes are cheap looking, the suspension stiff and the diesels engines clunky. Compared with some of the higher priced German alternatives they might have a point but that doesn't bother us at all. The more we drive the F-Pace the more we love it, so does the family dog who seems to prefer the refinements of the huge boot to the house.

Well done Inchcape! Well done Jaguar!"
8/3/18,5,"From my first visit to the collection of my new car everyone was so helpful. Clare Pepper was a pleasure to deal with and made the experience even easier and enjoyable. She is a lovely person and happy to help, even answers messages on her days off. The company work with you to do everything they can to find a car within your budget and at no time do you feel obliged to continue with the purchase. A very good experience indeed."
8/3/18,5,"Very efficient service, friendly, helpful staff."
8/3/18,4,"Non pressurised environment, decent p/x and pricing"
8/3/18,3,"I must say that I have always been very impressed with the service I’ve received from Coopers in the past, but on this latest occasion I was very disappointed with them.

Although I had booked my car for a service and m.o.t. several weeks previously, at the same time requesting specifically that the two items for which I had received call back letters be dealt with, I was disappointed to be informed, on dropping my car off, that Coopers only had the parts in stock to deal with one of the recall items. Although they had previously had the parts for the other item, they had now run out of them. This means that I have to continue driving through this exceptionally hot summer without the benefit of being able to turn the air conditioning up to its fullest extent.

Having left my car and mobile number with service reception at 10.00 am, it was only by chance that I happened to notice at about 2.30 pm that Coopers had sent me a video. I watched the video which explained that they were recommending replacement of my front brake discs and all brake pads. I telephoned them to check that they were proceeding with this work, to be told that they could not do so without my permission. Why did no one think to telephone me seeking that approval? Had I not noticed the video, I would have turned up to collect my car only to discover that I would have to return it (I live an hour’s drive away) for yet more work to be carried out at a later date.

They also mentioned when I telephoned that there was a leak in the screen wash container which they were investigating. When I called to collect the car at 5.00 pm I was told that they had not been able to repair it because it was awkwardly placed and would cost about £170 to gain access to. As I find the container leaks any liquid placed in it very quickly indeed, I’m now going to have to get it fixed because I’m otherwise in risk of breaking the law in driving with no screenwash."
8/3/18,1,"I have recently bought a VW Amarok ex demonstrator from Inchcape Chelmsford. I bought 'on spec' and requested a quote for fitting a towbar. Salesman (Tinashe) sent quote including towbar and 12 months road fund tax. He also sent through a finance quot. I declined finance, paid the deposit then had to chase salesman repeatedly to ensure vehicle was ready.
I employed a driver to collect the vehicle and when it was delivered, no tow bar.
I've asked the question why but other than Tiniashe (who not knowing I was calling to complain actually took the first phone call) saying that 'the towbar and road fund were dependent on finance being taken out' (they weren't, it's confirmed in writing), the dealership, Tinashe and his manager Richard are completely ignoring emails and phone calls.
Luckily I paid a deposit on my credit card so can claim back that way. They are very happy to take the money but if you want something afterwards, forget it, they simply aren't interested. If you care at all about customer service forget it, these guys are shocking.

Edit: So, I received the response below. I felt it to be fair that I gave them time to look at the issue so forwarded my original email of complaint to Jane, their 'customer champion'. This is apparently being looked at by Clive, the service manager at Chelmsford. Close to a week later and still not even a phone call. I've had the work carried out at a different dealership and when the vehicle went in, it was noted that there was an outstanding recall on the vehicle from December 2017 that Inchcape had failed to do. Bear in mind it was their demonstrator. So, it's actually got worse, not better!
I'd be happy to discuss this, the dealership has all my details and was able to contact me throughout the sales process and now nothing. So, as I originally stated:
Avoid, if you have any issue with the vehicle you'll receive no help whatsoever."
8/3/18,5,"We found all the staff very helpful & particularly Bilal, the sales person that dealt with us.
From the initial inquiry & test drive to the collection & handover all aspects were very professional
& made it a pleasant & hassle free experience."
8/3/18,5,I am happy to drive my 1st and new GLA 220d AMG line prem auto 4matic. Beautiful computer.😀
8/2/18,1,"Hi,

Honestly speaking I should give only 0 rating for the delivery experience. Very poor service and worst delivery ever we had so far. No proper hand over, no explanation about the car. We have to ask for everything after looking at the delivery of the other car on the same day and time. We are going through the manual and online to understand the operations.

Very very disappointed. This is one of our dream car however we had the worst experience.

We will not come back or recommend to friends and family."
8/2/18,5,All the staff who dealt with me were 100% professional and courteous.
8/2/18,5,"My car was booked in for a service after being in storage for 2 years - it had to be done as I returned to the UK for a new job.
Cooper were under tremendous pressure from staff shortages and problems with loan cars not being returned. But, Lucy Blood in service somehow, pulled out all the stops and managed to get it done. I don't know how, and I don't want to know how. But I do know that Lucy and Cooper BMW listened to my impossible schedule, understood and went the extra mile for me.
I bought my car at this dealership because, guess what, the salesman went the extra mile for me. There's something about Cooper that has a smaller more personal feel to it.
Highly recommended (and a massive thank you!)"
8/2/18,5,Easy experience from start to finish. Booked easily and managed to fit me in quickly. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Able to wait in a relaxed atmosphere with free drinks and magazines etc. Done in the time they advised it would take. Cleaned and hoovered the car for me too! Would definitely recommend them.
8/2/18,5,"Our service at Cooper Teesside was excellent. Our service advisor Joshua Sutcliffe was excellent - couldn’t do enough to help us, kept me updated throughout the day and all was as promised.

8/2/18,4,"Dropped in Passat for sevice at 8.15am 2 days ago
Very busy car park.
Soon processed at reception about 5 minutes.
rang at 4.30pm to check if done,service came back to me short while later to confirm finished.
Picked up ,good touches short email video with brief description of condition and a plug in to link car to smartphone (yet to fit)"
8/2/18,5,Booked a service online. Straight forward. The car was picked up from my home address and returned promptly.
8/2/18,5,Kept me informed of work required and the cost. Collected and dropped the car off after cleaning it.
8/2/18,2,"Service OK. Used the drive through option, no one came out to greet me on arrival, not very clearly signed where to go. Car needed an update to the sat nav and DAB radio which they could do on the day. Apparently, the internet was not good enough on the day!!

Had to rebook the car in for the updates. I booked one day and then had an email giving a different date. I contacted the service booking team to advise and they said someone would call me back. Guess what I am still waiting for the call back!!!

Site looks good, but service lacks attention to detail."
8/2/18,5,Easy and quick
8/2/18,5,Great service and attention to detail.
8/2/18,5,"My car was in for a recall, work carried out efficiently, staff very polite"
8/2/18,5,"I would recommend inchcape in Hyde, in particular Joel and his manager. Both salesmen were respectful of my situation and their levels of interaction were just right. As for the sales environment...the building was very clean and welcoming. The cars on sale are well laid out and reasonably priced. When my circumstances change I will consider buying from them."
8/2/18,5,lady on recption was very helpful phoned me when car was ready and told me other parts were on order very good service as this was a warranty recal on an older car from bmw
8/2/18,5,"Friendly, timely, organised and efficient. No issues at all."
8/2/18,5,An absolute pleasure dealing with Chris B. As salesmen go he's what we expect. One issue that had been created by BMW was handled professionally and communication was excellent. I'm feeling confidant that this will continue.
8/2/18,2,"Took my car in for a service and the booking process went well initially, polite, helpful and friendly voice on the phone. Friendly greeting and seen to quickly and provided a courtesy car. We discussed pick up time and I advised to call by 4pm latest as needed to pick up my son from care and didn't want to get stuck in traffic. Subsequently I did not receive a phonecall, so turned up at 4pm (given they had the car at 9am it didn't seem unreasonable). I then waited for 20 minutes before asking reception to chase Tom up as I had somewhere to be. Another 5 mins and another chaser. Eventually he saunters out of the office with no apology for keeping me waiting and just a question 'did I like the courtesy car'.........frankly a stupid question when it was a much more basic model than my own car and I would have preferred a sorry to have kept you waiting. Then another 5 mins of faffing in his office and he comes back with my key to say he hasn't done the paperwork so he will email it to me (did not confirm my email address). When asked if there was anything I needed to know he advised no I don't think so (not confidence building so lets hope the brakes are ok). No thank you for your custom and no follow up or email with my paperwork received so I guess I'll have to chase that up. Also found him to be patronising and frankly unhelpful. I received good service when buying the car through them, but unfortunately they were let down by Tom's poor customer service, lack of interest and attitude so I hope he receives feedback and training at the very least as he is letting the team down!"
8/2/18,2,"Very disappointing visit to the new Mercedes facility in North Coventry.
Upon arrival at 9am their lovely drive through service lane was backed up with cars so I couldn't enter. I parked my car immediately outside. it was then not clear where I should go so walked down the drive through lane. No one approached to I asked one of the office staff to the right of the lane who directed me to the other side which was the service lounge. Fab facility with TV and coffee bar, unfortunately still no help or recognition from the many staff buzzing about. After 10 minutes I then stopped one of these staff who said 'why didn't you go to reception' - hadn't appreciated there was one! After going over to reception they directed me back to the service lounge where they said someone would be over shortly. Further 5 mins passed, I asked again another member of staff who said Rebecca would be dealing with me but has another customer with her. I said I couldn't hang around and eventually another staff member did check my car in - this took in total 25mins from me entering to leaving the site. No one had offered a drink from the flashy coffee bar!
Later in the day I received an email to say a vehicle health check had been carried out but no mention of the service or steering column recall that the car had been booked in for. I tried to call the garage but had to wait 5 mins for the phone to be answered with my phone on loud speaker. I did try responding my email with my queries but that didn't work either. receptionist said Rebecca was on lunch and she would call me back which she duly did. I did mention to her my email, but she said that wouldn't be delivered. I mentioned to Rebecca my outstanding queries which she did follow up. One was around the rear wheel diagnostic, when she checked up on this it required a new tyre, which I was a bit surprised about as this appeared to have been missed from the original service and health check carried out earlier?
So generally a great facility let down by customer service that wasn't up to the mark that I would expect from a luxury brand. Busy working mums don't have the time to sit about waiting."
8/2/18,5,Much better than any other BMW Dealer I have used in this area (Weald of Kent)!
8/2/18,5,"Excellent service from the guys and girls at Cooper Teesside from start to finish.
Granted their car park can be a nightmare at busy times but the welcome and overall service you get from them is second to none.
Car ready eaely and plenty of text updates on progress AND health of the car.
Special mention to Eve on the service desk for her friendly manner and attitude...excellent.
Thank you from the Bolands."
8/2/18,4,"General Service was very good.
A little disappointed with the condition of the vehicle when delivered as given the vehicle was an approved BMW, it was not quite in the high level of condition i would expect.... some small dents in the bodywork which admittedly i didn't spot on initial vehicle inspection but was assured that everything would be double checked and re-mediated before it was delivered to me. It's still in good condition but not great in that respect and i feel the valet was not of the highest standards both internally and externally.
If i had to do it again i would pick up the car directly from the dealership so that i could point out the dents and have them dealt with before actually purchasing the vehicle. That's the slightly disappointing aspect because i would have expected the dents to be spotted by Coopers instead of expecting me to point them out."
8/2/18,5,"Kal Mutch exceeded any expectations I had of purchasing a new Business vehicle at Mercedes.The timescales for purchase and delivery where challenging at best. Kal displayed exceptional customer service and professionalism from the initial engagement to completion and delivery of the vehicle. I work within the banking industry liaising with multiple vendors and clients - Kal is one of the few salesmen who can articulate himself as one should, deliver company ethics whilst providing a service which goes above and beyond others. Exceptional assist to Mercedes and would be in any other Industry."
8/2/18,3,"Not great, took 50 mins to hand my keys over for a pre-booked service, more staff needed at peak times."
8/2/18,5,"Great service from Jade Coyle...needed new tyres and my quote, which was lower than BMW's, was matched, very speedy and efficient"
8/2/18,5,"Very speedy service, kept informed throughout, comfortable surroundings to wait with refreshments provided. Full overview of service completed and video sent to ensure checks done. Highly recommend."
8/2/18,5,Very professional team and my expectations were definitely exceeded. Car service excellent and cleaned inside and out as a complimentary additional. Very pleased. Richard.
8/2/18,2,"Terrible customer communications.
It took 6 phone calls to even to get somebody to answer . Then you get promises to ring back but nothing.
Over a period of a week I made 20 phone calls to them with just 2 responses.
It can't be that difficult, just get people to answer phone and call back when promised.
Probably the worst dealership communication I've experienced."
8/1/18,5,"As usual, the service was punctual, informative and professional"
8/1/18,5,"I brought my first car (Yaris Hybrid) and love it! The staff are so nice and friendly they went above and beyond to make my first time buying a car such a great experience that will not be forgotten. They explained everything about the car in a friendly and kind manner and made this a very special event by attaching balloons to the car for pictures. In addition, I got the car faster then expected which was a very nice surprise. Overall, such an amazing service and I would definitely recommend to first time buyers."
8/1/18,5,Very pleased with the service that I received. The salesman Matt very helpful always kept me informed about progress of the car. Would recommend inchcape Toyota.
8/1/18,4,"People were lovely and very helpful
Think it’s a crazy amount of money basically to have my car looked at, nothing was changed , repaired or renewed. Wasn’t even cleaned when I picked it up although I was told it would be!
But putting all that aside, like I said the staff were all very nice and I would take my car there if it needed any work done to it because of the staff and how nice they were"
8/1/18,4,Brilliant service from the service team.
8/1/18,5,The service we had at Chester Jaguar Inchcape was second to none The sales executives all were professional and courteous even the ones not dealing with us.I attended with my wife first and the executives helped with our questions without being pushy.After considerable thought and due consideration I plumped for the XF and with the guidance of Ashley and his manager the service was second to none They are a credit to Jaguar and I thank them and all the staff even Lisa on the phone at reception for their courteous and professional service.
8/1/18,5,"Excellent service, really made me feel valued. Managed to conjure up an automatic replacement car even though their system said none were availabe. Even sen me movie of the underneth of my car whilst they were servicing it.."
8/1/18,5,"They did what they said they would when they would, very professional."
8/1/18,5,Excellent facilities and service. The sales person was professional and genuinely committed to ensuring that we got what we needed in order to make decisions about purchasing a car and accessories
8/1/18,5,Very fast and attentive service. Excellent communication at all stages of our car purchase from Coopers in Colchester.
8/1/18,5,"Excellent World class service. Hugh thank you to Bart for completing our purchasing and doing a fabulous hand over, unforgettable great experience, kind, proffesional and super prompt thank you to Sunny for all his kindness, exceeding all expectations Tom Turner and the Centre Manager absolutely fantastic. Would recommend certainly to family and friends
Truely an incredible Mercedes team spirit.
Thank you"
8/1/18,5,"I needed to get my car booked in for its rear diff oil change, and Oxford Mercedes was the closest to me. Booking was very easy, and the whole process couldn’t have been smoother. Nice coffee too!"
8/1/18,5,"MINI Cooper York are quite brilliant. Very professional, everything is explained and completed to a superb standard. My car was returned with a clean bill of health and all was done in a timely fashion. I was informed throughout of the process and a video sent. Thank you"
8/1/18,5,"Although they advertised a car which they had sold days before the salesman (Tony) showed me others & I found a great used SLK.
Tony more than made up for the initial error by putting together a great deal for me.
He made the process simple & easy & I came away very, very happy with my SLK."
8/1/18,5,Very happy with the service I received from all staff. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Thanks Becky and Adile.
8/1/18,3,Received prompt attention but wifi service is poor so wasn’t able to carry out any work on laptop whilst sitting in the customer lounge.
8/1/18,5,"Staff were polite, courteous and explained fully the work that needed to be done. They always asked before carrying the work and the costs they gave were accurate. They are willing to go the extra mile to satisfy their customers. I have been going here for over 8 years and wouldn't go anywhere else."
8/1/18,5,"I recently bought a new BMW X5 from the Chelmsford branch, my experience with dealing with them was good, I had been speaking to a few different dealerships and visited Fairfield’s at southend who had a lot of knowledge regarding what I wanted to buy but they didn’t take any details from me and rushed me out of the showroom.

I found the Park Lane dealership to be very helpful, but they did not have the car in stock that I wanted.

i also had dealings with the BMW dealership in Enfield who were extremely arrogant and clearly they had reached their target for the month and refused to provide me with costs as they were not interested in me looking around for the best deal I could get. The salesperson I dealt with over the phone advised that he was going on holiday and would not be back until Thursday the following week and he advised me not to buy a car until he was back. Although they did advise that they were able to beat any dealership price anywhere in the UK. To me this was not the type of dealership I would want to conduct business with.

Ryan and Ian at the Chelmsford branch were extremely helpful sending me videos of the car as I was at work and unable to go to the dealership, they kept me updated with the full process right through the purchase of the car. I attended the dealership to sign the final documents and pick the car up, everyone there were very friendly and helpful. not at any stage did I feel that I was rushed out of the showroom once the papers were signed, I was shown through how everything on the car worked step by step and I feel that if required I would be able to go back and go over anything that I have forgot or did not ask the question about.

I would like to say thank you to Ryan and his team for making my purchase enjoyable and I would totally recommend to anyone to visit this branch if they are looking to buy a BMW."
8/1/18,5,"Excellent service throughout from Chris Belcher. Over the moon with my new car. The whole buying process was seamless, the car was immaculate and my expectations were exceeded several times over. Nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely be returning and will not hesitate to recommend Inchcape to family and friends"
8/1/18,1,"Car booked in for mot, which normally takes 20 minutes at an organised garage.
Pre booked while you wait appointment took two and half hours.
Lots of staff, non of which seem vaguely interested in their customers.
A nice showroom doesn’t equal good service, which can only stem from the top, bad cheif = uninterested indians
I will not be wasting my time their again."
8/1/18,5,"Car Service
My car came in for its service yesterday and everything was done on time and the staff were very helpful and the courtesy car I had booked was good too. In fact it was interesting to drive a different model!"
8/1/18,5,"Fantastic service, friendly, quick easy and great with the little one I brought along"
8/1/18,4,"My BMW was recalled due to an electrical fault, I took the car to BMW in Cooper in Cobham. Overall it was a positive experience they also under took some routine service work which was completed for the quoted cost. The disappointments were there was a long wait before being seen by a customer service advisor and I when I booked the car in I was offered a replacement car which was not available. However they offered to take me to my work place and pick me up which resolved the problem. This was actually better for me and appears to be part of the standard service offered to customers but for some reason it was not offered to me on booking the car in."
8/1/18,4,"Staff great all lovely and kind.
Jo Ragby is who dealt with me while I was there. 5 star service all round. Kepted me updated with everything that was going on."
8/1/18,5,From the very first phone call to the Toyota Inchcape garage in Basingstoke I was impressed and reassured by the professionalism and knowledge of every member of the team. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and I felt I could trust their advice. All in all an excellent experience... oh and I absolutely love my new car.
8/1/18,5,"Excellent Sales and Business Management Team at Guildford Lexus.
The Hand-over Bay experience was impressive except that the vehicle exit folding door seemed not to open very smoothly and was noisy. A more impressive solution might be to install an electric roller shutter door.
Although only a few days old, my new Lexus car appears to have been well built and to date I am pleased with my purchase."
8/1/18,5,"Excellent help, found me exactly the car I was looking for."
8/1/18,1,"In a nutshell:
1. Mileage advertised on Autotrader was more than double in reality and options stated in the ad wasn't on the car. (False Advertising)
2. Tried to convince us we were at fault for coming too early so waiting for service was our problem not theirs (Condescending)
3. Waited until we arrived at the dealership to inform us about stone chips on the car. (Deceitful)
4. Had my wife in tears with their attitude and horrible approach to customer service.(Arrogant)
5. Negotiated discount still hasn't been refunded. (Dishonest)
6. Refused to listen to any reasoning with regards to critical documentation related to exporting the car. (Holier than thou attitude)
7. Car wasn't even cleaned properly on arrival (Careless)

Undoubtedly the worst service received when buying a car. May change my rating pending the outcome of the investigation with Inchcape. My advice is stay away if you are buying a car from Cooper Croydon. Would give a zero if I could."
8/1/18,2,"On Monday 30th July I had booked my Discovery in for its first MoT Test at 1.30 pm and planned to wait with the vehicle as I was told that the wait would be around 1 1/2 hours.
During the wait I planned to talk to a salesman about trading in the Discovery for a new one.
I arrived early and booked in with the Service team who assured me that Sales had been informed and even though all the sales team were busy, I wouldn’t be forgotten.
I had also arranged to meet a colleague nearby at 3pm but that still gave me 2 hours to talk to sales.
At 2.45 I had to mention the fact that my Discovery hadn’t moved and that no-one from sales had spoken to me.
A salesman was rushed over to me, we had a 5 minute chat and I had to move on to my meeting with a promise that the MoT would be done.
To be fair, I got a call at 4.30 to say it was ready.
I was also promised an emailed quote regarding the new vehicle.
That was Monday, it’s now Wednesday and I’m still waiting.
I just got a feeling through the whole of Monday’s experience that I was not really a valued Customer. “Above and beyond”? Hardly.
This is off the back of the MoT being done free of charge as a result of poor Service at its last Service resulting in a good will gesture."
8/1/18,5,This was my first service after purchasing my countryman two years ago. It was easy to book a service and loan car online and when I arrived the handover was smooth and cheerful. I was given a time frame for the service and everything ran smoothly- I would definitely use this service again.
7/31/18,5,"Fantastic from the moment we walked in , my wife and I had been to several dealerships from ford to Nissan and a few car supermarkets, Inchcape Bolton was by far the best . We were met by Irfan shah who went out of his way to make us feel welcome and kept things simple and with no pressure . We also met Mark the manager who again couldn’t do enough for us and made the whole experience a pleasure , we will definitely be buying from them again in the future and I will sending family and friends there way , big thanks again to Irfan and Mark for sorting a couple of little jobs on the car .
Big thank you from Mark & Amanda ."
7/31/18,5,"Good service, good prices, easy to work with, professional and courteous"
7/31/18,5,What nice laid back experience I had buying my Mercedes-Benz no pressure at all and a big thank you to Ben and the team there at Cheshire oaks Owen
7/31/18,5,"Cooper BMW at Surbiton were very helpful, I traded in my car and got a reasonable price, the 2Series BMW which I purchased came from Morton near Leeds, having agreed to buy this car it was prepared to a very high standard, I finally took ownership of this car on the 30th July 18. The whole operation went smoothly.

I had no reservations with this dealership, their vehicles are A1 but then thats what one pays for, a very good car and service second to none, I would gladly recommend Cooper BMW to any prospective customer."
7/31/18,5,"Sales exécutive Tom Brown was amazing, very professional and courteous. A real asset to this team. Thanks again Tom, I will recommend Toyota Inchape to everyone!"
7/31/18,4,"Always curtious service just forgot one thing...

A pretty long wait when dropped off the car but appologised and offered a to home drop off. Also delivered the car back which was unexpected and great. Did book in a valet but this wasn't noted so not done just got a wash! Would have given 5* if had."
7/31/18,5,Very happy with the service I received. Kevin van Hinsbergh was a pleasure to deal with.
7/31/18,5,"I found the second hand Mercedes C200 Estate I wanted on line and called Inchcape, the Mercedes agent in Nottingham, who reserved the car for me on my payment of a deposit.
The car was ready for me to collect within a week and Inchcape gave me a reasonable trade-in price for my Saab.
When I delivered the Saab and collected the Mercedes they dealt with the paperwork very efficiently and gave me a good introduction to the car.
I am very happy with the service I received from Lee Blaber at Inchcape.
Thank you
Brian Lott"
7/31/18,5,I only came here to have a safety recall job fixed on my car but I've got to say I was thoroughly impressed by the excellent service provided from the start until completion of the job. I would highly recommend this garage and will definitely consider using them again in the future despite it not being local to ourselves.
7/31/18,5,"We drove over from Lytham St. Annes to York to have my low mileage XK serviced there because previous services were done there.
Great customer service, very polite and knowledgeable gentleman came to the Hilton Hotel to pick my car up and it was returned to the hotel underground car park just as efficiently. The service manager gave me a courtesy call to talk through how the service had gone and run through any 'out of the usual' expenses - it was number plate bulbs!!
Really good customer service, will definitely return next year!"
7/31/18,3,Kept waiting for a long time to drop off the vehicle in the morning and again to collect it in the afternoon
7/31/18,5,"Excellent all round customer service in Durham. A huge thank you to Simon Thompson for finding, ordering and arranging delivery so quickly and efficiently. The whole experience was perfect."
7/31/18,2,"I waited nearly 2 months for an appointment to get the car looked at because I needed a loan car only to receive a text in the weekend (car booked in on Monday) to tell me there was no loan car and to call in to rebook if needed putting the onus on the customer. I subsequently had a conversation with service who apologised and we worked around that.

I then asked for a call back to talk about the findings from the inspection. I didn’t get a callback I just got a brief text message. This was not what I asked for, was not what reception advised they would do for me and did not deal with my concerns. No apology when I did get a call back. I think Ford and Citroen give better customer service from friends and family. These are expensive cars. I expect better treatment not that price should be the price for customer service!"
7/31/18,4,"although the dealer was very helpful and kind. BMW Mini need to speed up their delivery times. great car but ""yawn"" on delivery times, on a car that was basic except for tinted windows."
7/31/18,5,"The whole experience from start to finish was excellent. The service and MOT were carried out as requested.
All staff were very polite and curtious."
7/31/18,5,Car was in for 20K service. I waited for tbe duration of tbe work. 1st class service efgicenr courteous staff and work undertaken in a timely manner Would gladly recommend Inchscape Colchester
7/31/18,5,best VW showroom in East London. Very nice staff who are knowledgeable about what they sell can't fault this place.
7/31/18,3,"3 miles down the A3 after the service, the warning lights come on for tyre pressure on all tyres. Did not take the advice and stop, but not too impressed with the health check they did, as this is probably a very common problem. Also, having booked the MOT and check several weeks in advance, they emailed me a few days before my booked date to say they were suddenly very busy, and could a rebook in 4 weeks time. No, as my MOT was due. They took the car on the originally booked date, but this does not fill me with confidence."
7/31/18,4,"Booked company car in for service over the website, although had confirmation emails the collection times could have been better communicated when rang to check the person who answered cut me off mid-conversation.
The car was picked up and returned and the handover was professional and friendly. The car received a clean but in comparison to previous service experience with another provider, this was to a poor standard.
4 stars"
7/31/18,5,Great service. Consistently. Communication is very good from this dealer.
7/31/18,2,"The responses from the service team were fantastic however the policy on previously purchased service packs is just outrageous.

I purchased a TLC XL package and at the time of my MOT it was nine days out of date. The policy on the package is eight years, or 80,000 miles whichever is sooner.

They were unwilling to budge and the equivalent cost of the items included on the service pack would have been £450.

Also, i reviewed back through my previous service history and advisory items such as repairing a fuel leak and break pads, and these had varying costs to repair.

There needs to be better customer service from Mini Croydon to contact your existing customers, and also to provide consistency on faults or prices to repair otherwise I just think you're trying to rip me off.

I wouldn't buy another Mini for this reason."
7/31/18,5,"Friendly and very professional service. Excellent all round
Superb"
7/31/18,5,Very good service. Up to date advice and friendly staff. Video of car service is a very good idea
7/31/18,5,Great service and assistance in purchasing my new car. Good valuation for trade in; I’m very happy with my GLA 👍.
7/31/18,3,"Vehicle was prepared before arrival, a fair deal. Took too long to get through the paperwork, personnel needed were otherwise busy, salesman did not seem to have total responsibility, no negotiation was possible, any extras needed an order even for a gallon of petrol !! Answering e-mails is not the strongest discipline, leaving unanswered questions, not good when there is impact to insurance quotes."
7/30/18,5,"I had a great experience buying a used car.
The staff there are very helpful and responsive.
Very impressed."
7/30/18,5,Amazing customer service. The real “rock star” treatment even though I was there for a 2nd hand cheaper approved used Mercedes.
7/30/18,5,Great service from Audi Stockport. I arrived and found that the courtsey car i was booked to have had not been arranged with them. This was not a problem for them and they sorted it out really quickly. I have found them always really professional.
7/30/18,5,"Very friendly and helpful sales experience, with out high pressure sales"
7/30/18,3,"It was an average experience but nothing more. It was on time and the price is what I expected and all was fine. I did not expect to have to return and ask for my service book to be stamped, the service desk staff said they do not go out to the cars ( which is where the service book is kept). The keys were taken to have the car serviced but no one asked what service was being done or if there were any problems, may explain why I was called later to be informed what the costs were going to be and if there was any thing to be done. I use another vehicle maintained by a nother non franchised dealer. the experience there is more personal"
7/30/18,5,"Excellent experience. No waiting, guided to the service desk from the moment I walked in. Smooth seamless service. Courtesy car was much better than expected (420 x drive). Service delivered ahead of schedule and Liam was friendly helpful attentive and in control. Well done good job."
7/30/18,1,"We had absolutely appalling service at Coopermini Durham today. We had travelled 30 miles to test drive electric/petrol car. When we did so, it was not charged!!! Sales assistant unapologetic. We waited more than 30 mins before we even saw the car. No way would we deal with this garage."
7/30/18,2,"It was a very disappointing and upsetting experience for me and my infant. I Would not be going back there again. The customer service was awful. I was given a vehicle as a courtesy car while mine was being serviced by Inchcape. The car in question was faulty, it broke down on the motorway, it lost power and refused to drive and then started smoking. I had my infant with me. Called Inchcape in Preston to notify them of the situation, I was given the run around but eventually given a number to call and basically sort the issue myself. They were very much aware of the smoke and the fact I had a baby with me. I sat waiting for the tow car for 2hrs. Made it home in one piece. The next morning no representative of Inchcape called to ask how I got on the day before, I had to call again to figure out how to pick my vehicle... again I was asked to arrange for the pickup myself. On raising my disappointment the lady said “i understand where you’re coming from but I had been busy all morning” . All she seemed bothered about was ensuring payment was made as the lady said “we close by 1pm and payment must be made before we release the vehicle” My whole day was wasted as I sat again for 5hrs waiting for the tow truck.

I did share my disappointment when I picked up my car and was promised a courtesy call from the manager but didn’t get any. I certainly won’t be going back there."
7/30/18,4,"My experience was mixed, but I score the rating high because even though there were issues they were dealt with very well.

At the start of my purchase process Abi was my salesperson, then she was unavailable & Steve Champion took over. Finally Steve went on paternity leave & Will completed the process. Steve did a very good job at understanding my requirements & finding a suitable vehicle.

My major disappointment occurred on the day that I was scheduled to take possession of the car. The date & time had been agreed several days previously; on the morning in question I was told that the car was still in Derby & there would be a three day delay. Will intervened, took action & the delay was minimal.

I am very pleased with my new car."
7/30/18,3,"I purchased a Jaguar from Inchcape Norwich. I traded in my Nissan Qashqai which had cherished number plates on it which I wanted to retain as they were a present from my wife. I applied to DVLA to retain the number via their online system and got an instant authorisation to put the original number back on the car.
I was then asked by Inchcape if I could pick the Jaguar up on Friday rather than the following Tuesday as the sales person I had been dealing with would be off on leave the following week and would prefer to do the hand over himself (very commendable and helpful). When I arrived to collect the Jaguar, because I was still waiting for the amended registration document for my Nissan Qashqai I was told that I would have to leave a £500 deposit, refundable when I gave them the registration document. Seemed a bit excessive but knowing I would have the new registration document quite quickly I paid it.
The new document arrived today (Monday) the day before I was originally due to collect the car. So off I go to Inchcape to give them the registration document and get my deposit returned. This is when it gets most annoying. I was told my refund can take up to 5 weeks to process and has to be authorised by head office first.

So my feelings are:- not only do Inchcape not have trust in me as a customer they also don't have trust in their own staff to process a refund, a refund for a deposit they didn't actually have to take as the registration document clearly states 'THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT PROOF OF OWNERSHIP' and if I hadn't taken it to them they could simply apply for a duplicate, they had the car, they had the signed agreement from me that the vehicle had been bought by them in part exchange for my car. If they really, really are so untrusting of others, a £20 deposit would be more than sufficient. Therefore, if I had waited until Tuesday to collect the car as was originally discussed, the would not have asked for a £500 deposit and Inchcape would not be sitting with my £500 in their account for five weeks. Will they be paying interest?

The staff at Inchcape Norwich were superb and could not have been more helpful. They made my initial contact with the company feel as though they were going to be good to deal with. I would give the staff 10/10 Sadly however their hands are tied by their own head office which somewhat spoiled the experience."
7/30/18,5,Great garage service well done what more does anyone want
7/30/18,5,"Staff are very helpful and friendly. Kept up to date with progress of service, received a text and phonecall to inform when ready to collect"
7/30/18,4,"Yes thank you the car was fine except for one problem which you knew about the indicator in the left mirror ,i know you supplied one which was fine only when we went to fit it the cover was also broken on the inside which we had to get a new one
Apart from that all was fine"
7/30/18,5,"We bought our preregistered C class remotely and Inchcape were accommodating unlike some of their competitors.
The car was immaculately prepared and exactly as described.
Happy to recommend Inchcape Derby, we'd certainly deal with them again if changing in future."
7/30/18,2,"Not happy at all with the response I received. Also, emailed them twice as
regarding a faulty product and I still have not heard from them!"
7/30/18,5,"Called in on the off chance as I was considering trading in my 5 Series. At the time unsure whether to downsize to a 4 or stay with the 5. Dan was excellent, looked at and drove both cars with no pressure to buy. Once the decision was made great service and deal in respect of the trade in and the new car.

Fast forward five weeks and the happy owner of a new 530D M Sport X Drive.

Top notch from Dan and the team from start to finish. Thank you Andy."
7/30/18,3,"My first service appointment with BMW Ipswich, While booking appointment I made it clear I wanted Courtesy Car, but I wasn't provided courtesy car nor was informed/clearly mentioned while making service appointent that courtesy car isn't available. And later it was made as if I didn't listen to the receptionist. Next time no appointment without courtesy car. Would have appreciated if they at least paid for cab."
7/30/18,5,"Really impressed by the service at Mini in Malton. Was raining hard, part of the service area had been badly damaged, but they still did my service and were finished earlier than anticipated. Very professional and I highly recommend them"
7/30/18,5,"Polite and helpful staff, great video of the safety check and car left looking as good as new thanks to a complimentary wash and vac"
7/30/18,5,Superb staff especially Tom! They have genuinely gone the extra mile for this purchase.
7/30/18,5,Gave my Mercedes C220 for a regular A service at Inchcape Mercedes Benz at Warrington. Booking and scheduling the service was convenient. Happy with the customer care and service too.
7/30/18,1,"Appalling service, and problems completely avoidable.

I contacted BMW following the multiple recall notices highlighted by Watchdog.

I thought I had better initiate something as after a month of watching the TV program, I still had heard nothing form BMW. After many phone calls I manged to get an appointment for the work, albeit 12 weeks in the future. I was told that there was no option for a hire car or their car-collection service as this was a recall job.

I called BMW a few days before the appointment to check that all was fine for the 2xrecall work. I was informed all was well. In fact BMW called me a few days later (at 6pm the eve of the visit) to re-confirm they were all systems go.

On turning up the following morning at 8:30, I jokingly said I hope you have the parts in – and the representative said that it was unlikely that the parts were in – they had been on back-order!!!!
Sure enough they could only do one of the recalls. No parts for the other.

I did inform BMW that I was selling the car that afternoon, and it was on condition all the recall work was complete. Remember I had to wait 12 weeks for the parts and BMW had confirmed several times that they could complete the work – even on the evening before the job.
I subsequently lost the sale and now face taxing and insuring two cars simultaneously.
All of this was avoidable since BMW knew they did not have the parts for the job.

I would have liked to discuss this feedback with the dealership first, but the email from them requesting feedback is only signed “Cooper BMW -Reading”, no name or contact details………

Hopeless! Am moving to Mercedes."
7/30/18,3,"Not the speediest service - nearly 2hrs waiting for the car to be returned.

When paying for service, I was quoted a full hour's labour charge (£118).

Upon my protest, the sales assistant checked the amount of time spend on the vehicle, which was 0.7 - 42mins. The price was immediately adjusted to £82.60.

Honest mistake, or something more cynical? You decide."
7/30/18,5,"Excellent service from Kevin Lewis, very knowledgeable and considerate to needs of customer. Fast and efficient service and always available to answer any questions. Will definitely recommend in the future."
7/30/18,5,Fantastic service from start to finish
7/30/18,1,"I took my vehicle in for work under warranty. It had a leak, problem with drivers door and a faulty tyre sensor. Told me they couldn't find leak, needed to order part for the door and they had fixed sensor. Drove 20 mins home by which time tyre sensor warning light had come back on. I had a call to tell me part was in for the door. Took vehicle back, told them tyre sensor was still faulty. They fixed door and now found a leak from the injectors. I would have to come back. Told me sensor was fixed but drove home and light came back on again. Took vehicle back for injector leak to be repaired and tyre sensor. Now my electric door was not working properly so informed them of this fault. Drop vehicle at 08.30 and at 14.30 the man dealing with it rings me up. Can they keep vehicle overnight as their is a problem with the door? I tell him no and he says he will ring me when vehicle is ready to collect. It gets to 16.30 and I have heard nothing. I rings them up and the receptionist tells me that the vehicle is ready to collect and the keys will be at the desk. I ask her about other problems but she tells me that the guy has gone home so she will get somebody to sort it out. I order a taxi and I'm halfway to the garage when I get a call from them. The vehicle is not ready to be collected as they have a problem with the injectors. I ask why I was told that it was and the guy says he doesn't know. Next day I'm told vehicle is fixed. I go and pick it up and I'm told that there is nothing wrong with the door and some cock and bull story about the tyre sensor couldn't be fixed as there was a problem with the machine. Anyway, the door is still not working. I was told to ring them up and the sensor would be fixed while I waited. I rang them up and the receptionist informed me that the person handling it all was off. She would get somebody to ring me. Still waiting a week later.Surely somebody can book you in????? Anyway I sent an email to them telling them what had happened. Still waiting for a reply to that as well. The attitude of the staff who give you mis-information, no help,no follow up calls and seemingly couldn't care less is shocking. Having contacted the management and had no response you can see that the staff are just following their leaders."
7/30/18,1,"WORSEST BMW DEALERSHIP IN UK
I have booked my vehicle in for last Thursday and when I got there I have been told that my booking was cancelled for some reason. Then I have been offered to come in on Saturday but I won’t get a loan and I will have to wait arround 3 hours to get it serviced. I agreed to it and then I came in on last Saturday and when I got there I had to wait 1 hour to be served and then I have been told that my car is apparently to heavy for the ramp because it is a long wheel base, so it can not be serviced with BMW Thames DItton (which is a complete LIE).
I have been told to call Bmw Croyden and book it with them.
I have now called BMW Thames DITTON again and asked if I can get my car serviced even tho it is a long wheel base car and they have said that it has never been a problem for Bmw Thames DITTON to serivce a long wheel base car. Apparently they do it all he time. So all they did on Saturday was lying to me so they get rid of me. This is my first serivce with BMW and it has been a the worst. The worst dealership I have ever dealt with. How can you lie to your costumers? And how can you even consider yourself as a professional dealership. I will take this further and make sure this will not be forgotten. I have checked the reviews of Bmw Thames DITTON and their serivce is really Poor. A lot of people are complaining about basic things."
7/30/18,5,"Extremely attentive and helpful!
Great experience and polite staff."
7/30/18,1,"Very disappointing will never use again,
They call you names behind your back and lie to cover it up , only found out because one of the fools can't use emails properly"
7/29/18,5,From start to finish the team at Cooper York were superb. Product knowledge was excellent and they really understood what I wanted. After visiting several mini garages that just didn’t seem interested Mini Cooper York really excelled in ensuring I had a world class experience. I would definitely recommend going here if your after a mini.
7/29/18,1,"I visited Audi Twells yesterday with a friend who was having her Audi serviced, but as they were so busy I gave up waiting and decided to return today. After sitting with Sam for and hour and half, about to walk out to test drive an A1 I was introduced to Andy the Sales Manager. I have never met anyone ruder in my entire life. This man proceeded to tell me, in no uncertain terms and with sheer contempt that my vehicle which I wished to PartX was worth £2800. I challenged this as not only do I work in the motor industry myself, I have done research beforehand including a full HPI and checks on AutoTrader etc so I know my car is worth between £5.5K to a max of £7K! When I explained this to him he simply shrugged his shoulders and said ""oh well, that's all i can say..bye!"" I had to walk out. Andy ,due to your arrogance and poor customer service skills you have literally lost a £13K sale over a £2700 dispute all because you/Audi need to make sure you undercut and scam anyone who walks through those doors. I would like to say that Sam was brilliant but Andy you need some lessons in customer service. I will 100% not be recommending Audi Tunbridge Wells."
7/29/18,2,"When purchasing your car there is communication.When you require there assistance after purchase there is next to no communication,no return phone calls or emails.9 days waiting for number plates and a paint stick.Once you have spent your money don't expect customer service."
7/29/18,3,"I had a Gold service on my 10 year old Toyota in October 2017. The brake fluid was overfilled above the 'max' level, the engine oil not filled to the upper fill level and I doubted if the key fob coin battery had been replaced. The incorrect mileage was also recorded in my service book.
Attention to detail & quality control appeared lacking!"
7/28/18,5,"Great service
Thanks"
7/28/18,5,"Friendly, polite and efficient service from start to finish from Paul Hubbard and the team. From initial enquires to collection I was kept fully informed and Paul offered to collect me from the train station as I was travelling up from South Wales. 100% satisfied."
7/28/18,5,My car was booked for a free check up. Car was ready at the time stated & I was phoned when ready.
7/28/18,5,Amazing professional service concistant right from selection to payment and delivery of vehicle.
7/28/18,1,"I recently had my wife’s Mini JCW serviced (July 7th) performed at Cooper Banstead on a pit stop service. A day before I noticed the low washer fluid notification show up on the screen, as I knew this would be part of the service I didn’t see it as an issue.

I took it in for a service, they said it would be done within 2 hours, which noting the website shows a pit stop is 90 minutes, I wasn’t impressed, but I let it go.
I drove away from the service, the warning notification had gone as I expected, then first thing last week it reappeared, even though it clearly states on the invoice that it has been done along with all the other checks. The cleaning of the car was also well below a an acceptable standard with the alloys still very dirty. To say I am disappointed firstly is an understatement, furthermore my thoughts are if this wasn’t done, then what else hasn’t been done properly that we are unaware of. We purposely didn’t go to Stephen James in Bromley which is nearer to us, as we thought they would provide a better service, obviously this hasn’t been the case. I also have a BMW which needs its third service, but I won’t be takin it to them, as the service is far below what I would expect from a BMW/ Mini service centre. I emailed them about my concerns at Cooper, but they didn’t respond. Avoid !"
7/28/18,4,Very quick to get my car booked in. Process when there very efficient and staff helpful
7/28/18,5,My experience at Mercedes was top rate from beginning to end. Jay was absolutely superb He made me feel so very welcome and gave me time to ask questions giving me hiss full attention. He was knowledgeable and competent and made the whole experience a pleasure.
7/26/18,5,"I recently bought a new Land Rover Discovery from Inchcape Chester.

My experience was second to none.

The sales executive Andrew Haynes was courteous, helpful and extremely knowledgeable.

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Inchcape to anyone considering buying a car in the near future."
7/26/18,4,"Received the V5 today and it had the wrong address on, otherwise no complaints. Salesman was very attentive sending photos and contacting me regularly to see if everything was OK"
7/26/18,5,Very helpful staff - particularly the sales executive.
7/26/18,5,"No fuss, no hassle MOT I didn’t have my mobile with me so they suggested a common sense approach of low cost items just being done. They also let me know that my MOT would be cheaper than quoted as tgey had an offer on, totally unlike other garages I have used who seem to pile on as much cost as possible."
7/26/18,5,"Great service 1st class
Good job"
7/26/18,5,"One of the best customer experiences I’ve encountered, Thomas the sales consultant was professional, friendly and genuine, nothing was too much trouble for him. From test drive to buying to collecting and sorting out a minor issue everything was perfect. I would highly recommend this dealership."
7/26/18,5,"Easy to book, car was ready on time, clean and ready to go"
7/26/18,5,As always my experience at Cooper Norwich was friendly and efficient.
7/26/18,5,"Had to return my Mercedes Benz GLC220D for a safety recall check. Booked an appointment at the MB Inchcape Nottingham Dealership and was dealt with by Service Specialist Tom on the day. Safety check carried out on time with a complimentary car clean.
Good service"
7/26/18,2,"I bought my first Mercedes and was convinced by the salesman that the Alloy and bodywork insurance would be a good idea. I used the Inchcape app for the first time on May 11th (10 months after buying the car) to log alloy damage and paintwork damage (both show in the app history). However, the date given to fix the alloy was not until June 18th and when I called to query the wait I was told the bodywork issue hadn’t even been logged by Inchcape with the insurance company! So 2 jobs that I expected to be done simultaneously we’re not completed at the same time. I had the alloy work done, but it’s now July 26th and still no sign of the bodywork being done! I now have another small scratch on the car to fix, so I have chased for the original fix to be completed as well. I’ve been told by Inchcape via Twitter that I haven’t logged the job, but how can the app state that I have??! I was told when I bought the car that logging issues would be easy via the app. I also paid a lot for this extra cover, which I’m now regretting!"
7/26/18,5,"Excellent, friendly service. You know exactly what is going to happen and how much it will cost. I particularly liked the women’s magazines and free coffee provided while you wait."
7/26/18,5,"After having had a not very good experience purchasing the latest of my BMW at Coopers Tunbridge Wells, I returned to have a fault checked and found your After care service refreshingly good. I was dealt with in an old fashion caring way and efficiently on my arrival and the action taken was carefully explained, which satisfied me entirely. Thank you BMW Coopers.
Christopher White"
7/26/18,5,Reaaly pleased with the way were
7/26/18,1,"Communication poor. I left six messages for the person in the service department to call me back. Not a single return call. The only time I was able to talk to this person was on the rare occasion that my call was put through and she actually answered.
I also rang and left a message for the service manager to call me as I wanted to complain about the poor communication and guess what.... he didn’t call me back either.

My warranty repair has now been completed but I would not consider using Inchcape at Warrington ever again

I have used Chester in the past and have always found the customer service excellent.. it’s a pity this standard of service is not reflected in all Inchcape dealerships"
7/26/18,5,Lindsey was very helpful and friendly when I took my son's polo in for a routine service and MOT check at Bury. Will definitely go back.
7/26/18,5,"Mercedes-Benz Coventry
I have used them for servicing and more recently for an MOT. They have recently relocated to new premises which are bigger and better, especially for dropping the car off. The staff are friendly and professional and I m very satisfied with the service received."
7/26/18,5,Very professional and friendly service. The salesman took a lot of effort to get the whole specification and additional equipment just right. This meant the vehicle took some time to arrive but I was kept updated along the way. If the service department is as good as this I shall be using them as well.
7/26/18,1,"Dealt with Mini Cooper Colchester on a used mini. Paid a deposit and full balance when they then said the car had been wrongly priced and I needed to pay an extra £1500 if I wanted it. The worst customer service, nobody would accept blame. I had sold my car so was left a week without a car needing to get to work and the full £16500 was taken on Monday and so far on Thursday I’ve only received £500 back so no way of buying a new car. Manager refused to speak to us after husband told them exactly what he thought of them, they just washed there hands of us."
7/26/18,5,"Got my Prius AC Recharged at Toyota/Lexus Battersea. They were the cheapest Toyota dealer at only £59.99 for a Recharge & Sanitation.
Excellent customer service from Start to finish. Will definitely use them again.
The Video health check is fantastic."
7/26/18,5,"Can’t thank Syed enough for all this help, from the moment we walked in to the moment we left with a new car he was attentive to all of our needs. For my first experience buying a car he made it very straightforward and made sure the car had everything I required. He also kept in contact throughout the process including email updates and videos of the car. Would recommend to everyone."
7/26/18,5,did what they said what they were going to do great communication from them
7/26/18,1,"I recently had my car serviced at Cooper Croydon and it has to be one of the worst customer service experiences I have encountered for many years.
I had seen the reviews but thought most people only complain when they're not happy so didn't think it could be that bad. Sadly I was mistaken.
The pick-up from work was fine but I heard nothing from them for the rest of the day. I called at 5pm for an update but it's nigh on impossible getting to speak to anyone in the service department. When reception puts you through you don't get bounced back to be able to leave a message so you're obliged to phone back. When I did get to speak to someone they told me I should have been told my car was needed for 2 days. Had I been warned of this I would have made alternative arrangements to get home from work. I needed to rely on the goodwill of a colleague to go out of her way to take me home. Admittedly Cooper Croydon did offer to pay a taxi fare but I decided on the former option for the sake of simplicity.
Quite unbelievably on the second day I had the exact same experience i.e. absolutely no updates or communication. It was incumbent on me to phone them to enquire as to the whereabouts of my car. Once more I was passed from pillar to post and no-one was available to take my call in the service department.
I had a call back approximately 10 minutes later (not by the person who was apparently my service manager) to be told my car would be returned 5.45 – 6.15pm. I had a personal appointment at 6.30 so this was far too late so the car was delivered to my home address.
I did not get a particularly positive impression of the dealership when I was looking to purchase the car in the first instance and bought it elsewhere. However, since Cooper Croydon is by far the closest service centre to me I thought it merited trying.
It should not be down to the customer to check on the status of their vehicle. At no stage did I receive an apology.
What I also find astounding is that, if the reviews are anything to go by, this is a continuing issue and is not going to be resolved.
I have no idea why two days were required in the first instance but would guess that more work is taken on than can be handled and a backlog is created as soon as an issue arises.
I’m afraid that I will not be returning to this dealership."
7/26/18,5,So helpful and efficient and lovely people too
7/26/18,3,Average experience my expectations were meet but not exceeded as you’d hope with this brand..
7/26/18,5,"Excellent service from start to finish from Cooper BMW, Norwich."
7/26/18,4,Good service overall. Suggest phoning client night before collection with a approximate time for collection of vehicle on day of service.
7/26/18,5,"my Mercedes c class went in for an A service, was seen and dealt with on the same day and my car was ready within a few hours."
7/26/18,5,We had unfortunate other commitments on the day booked for the service and Cooper BMW Colchester went out of their way to accommodate us by arranging extraordinary pick up and return of the vehicle.
7/26/18,2,"I bought a C Class Coupe from the Derby dealership. The car is fantastic but the dealership service is poor. It is very difficult to get hold of the sales team by telephone, you leave a message with the receptionist but they never ring you back. Send them an email and you get no reply until you chase. After chasing on one occasion I was told they had problems with their server and the email wasn't received so I had to resend.
In person it seems to be better though, as the day I picked the car up everything went well. The salesman took a lot of time to explain the car features to me and everyone was extremely polite and helpful.
Overall I wouldn't recommend this dealership."
7/25/18,4,BMW can never tell you what your service will cost. They have to scan your key. Then they scan it and tell you “oh it’ll be about £250”. Then when you pick it up they say how they’ve done you a favour and it’s “only £206”. How hard can it be just to get the price right to start with? Every other manufacturer can! Apart from this the visit was painless!
7/25/18,5,"Service and staff excellent only criticism rust on brake disks not covered under warranty on a £45,000 motor. Told it is just something that happens. Feel Audi should look at over coming problem especially what is charged for coloured brake callipers , looks really good red brake calipers goes well with rust on brake disks"
7/25/18,5,"The service advisor Catherine was personable, attentive and knowledgeable. When the cost of the work over and above the service costs which were covered she negotiated a lesser cost so really pleased."
7/25/18,3,Expected better waited a long time for MOT and was going to change the vehicle waiting an hour also for the salesman to be free
7/25/18,5,"Friendly and courteous staff, always make feel welcome. Only problem is the wait. Make you look at all the amazing cars in the showroom!! 😊 should supply blindfolds on entry! 😂😂 quality people. Thank you"
7/25/18,3,"The experience of buying my new car at Inchcape Toyota was totally spoilt by a barrage of sales talk for extras. There was tyre insurance, cosmetic insurance, new for damaged etc. It took a whole hour before I was even given access to my car."
7/25/18,5,excellent all round service.
7/25/18,2,"Happy with car and cost, was not happy I was charged for Gardex when I didn’t request it"
7/25/18,5,"Great service, very easy to deal with."
7/25/18,4,Very simple transaction and work completed quickly. Only downside was the wash/wax I paid extra for. It absolutely wasn’t worth £15.
7/25/18,5,"Efficient, helpful, courteous."
7/25/18,5,"After 15 years experience of Coopers my expectations are high and never disappointed. The young man dealing with me, although relatively new to the job, was personable and attentive and it was good to renew friendships I have built up over the years.
The service was completed promptly and important advice supplied."
7/25/18,5,From the minute I stepped into the dealership I knew I was going to enjoy buying my next car. I had a specific spec and colour and as soon as I told Paul he said that although they didn’t have it they would get me it. I only waited 3 days and my dream car was mine. Thank you for being patient with me Highly recommend Mercedes Benz Liverpool
7/25/18,5,Customer service was excellent. Loved my car before but love it even more after its service. Thanks to all the team.
7/25/18,4,"Trouble free service for my BMW 320.

All as planned and good communication.

Gordon"
7/25/18,5,Well impressed my MOT was done while I wait and car cleaned too. All in one hour.thank you.
7/25/18,3,"Quoted time for completion 1.5-2 hours, actual time over 3 hours. No apology or explanation given. Mercedes Me app fitted, but I was not even give a leaflet telling me the benefits or even which app to download - very poor communication."
7/25/18,1,"BMW Thames Dutton service dept are difficult to contact on the phone and fail to meet their promises to call back and also fail to deliver on agreed aspects of service.
My BMW was dropped off for recall work and some other recommended work. I had arranged for the car to be returned after completion.despite the service rep telling me after the work that my car would be delivered back, it was not. I tried email and phone the next day and had no reply. Eventually the car was returned keys shoved though letterbox. However there was no call. Eventually got through to rep, excuse was undermanned and he had 200 email in inbox. I raised this with inchcape to complain.
Their eventual reply:

We do now have a new Management structure in place for our Thames Ditton retailer, we have been aware of instances within the retailer which have not been of a positive nature, please be rest assured this has and is being addressed, may we apologise for any inconvenience caused.
So given the new management better service?
Well time will tell
Jul 2018."
7/25/18,4,"Everything was made easy, collection & return service very prompt, driver was very polite and courteous"
7/24/18,5,"Purchased a GLE Coupe AMG 43 through Harriet Smith at the Nottingham showroom.
- Good Sales executive
- Responsive
- Handover administration was professionally done and comprehensive.
- Lovely showroom and professional staff
- Although new, Harriet attended to us as best she could. All questions post collection were researched and response received very quickly over email."
7/24/18,5,Prompt efficient service. Reasonable value.
7/24/18,5,Really straightforward experience trading in my old car for a new Mini and had my new car in just over a week. Knowledgeable and courteous staff - a no stress process from start to finish.
7/24/18,4,The service second to none. The only negative trying to park on site.
7/24/18,5,What a great experience from drop off to pick up. Very impressed
7/24/18,5,A fantastic and friendly service. Me and my family were made to feel very welcome by all the staff at the Loughborough Mercedes branch. There were activities to keep the kids busy whilst we waited to bring our car home and complimentary hot drinks for everyone. All staff were very professional and greeted us very well.
7/24/18,3,"Could not book courtesy car as they have a 6 week lead time. Could not work from the showroom as the “lounge appointment” have a 4 week lead time. Arrived for appointment and quoted the service price is £589 not £553 (£589 includes courtesy car they do not have available). Advise replacement tyres x 3. One is 2.5mm, one is 2.2mm and 3rd is 1.6mm. 1.6mm needed replacing but other tyres still have thousands of miles (new tyre is only 8mm for circa 20,000 miles). Replaced 2 x tyres. Total cost £1100 for service. Picked up car after 6 hours and cost of two taxis. They had cleaned the vehicle but not dusted the inside surfaces. I appreciate it is a 1st world problem but at the equivalent of nearly £200 per hour that they had the car I would have expected better."
7/24/18,4,I would have given 5 stars but again the service management led the side down. I asked for a callback about a warranty question and was promised a callback which didnt happen. This is not the first time this has happened. Everything else was amazing from start to finish including the video report and a bill less than I was expecting. Great car great service - management let you down.
7/24/18,5,"I've been looking for a new car for several months and visited several places for test drives, but have been constantly put off by really some terrible customer service from pushy unprofessional salesmen. Finally got exactly what I wanted from Mercedes-Benz Warrington. Superb customer service of a very professional standard across the board, from the moment you walk in the showroom."
7/24/18,5,Always a pleasure dealing with Cooper Colchester Mini. They must be good because now on my 4th Mini in 10 years
7/24/18,5,Excellent service and very polite and helpful when you call
7/24/18,5,"Just taken my Golf to Inchcape Exeter, this being the second time the first for a full service and on this occasion an Air-Con Service. This really is a top outfit, they combine a professional approach whilst being very friendly and courteous.
On introducing myself at reception and being given the impression that nothing would be too much trouble I was passed over to Natasha Wright a Service Advisor given that I was a hour early and had booked a service whilst I waited on the premises, Natasha arranged that my vehicle was serviced straight away, offering drinks whilst I waited.
I have to say that I can be a rather difficult unforgiving customer if I feel I'm not receiving the appropriate response in such situations, these guys perform at a standard that I would expect from a very high end customer service outlet such as top hotels etc.
On receiving my vehicle it had being washed and valeted again to a good standard."
7/24/18,5,Great service. Would definitely recommend this Garage.
7/24/18,4,Asif at Cooper Croydon was very helpful sourcing a used Mini that fulfilled my requirements very quickly.He also took the trouble to give me the opportunity to test drive a model similar to the one I purchased and then the one I purchased once it arrived. A delay in the arrival at Cooper Croydon of the Vehicle documents is the only reason why I haven't awarded 5 Stars. Friendly and respectful treatment from all the staff at Cooper Croydon.
7/23/18,5,"I was really pleased with my car 1st service .
Reception also arranged to get me to work; which was much appreciated.
I would recommend to everyone Well done Inchcape👍"
7/23/18,3,"Firstly, after booking a courtesy car 6weeks in advance I was contacted the day before the booking to be told no car available, which I accepted politely, to be told my car would be MOT & services promptly in 2 to 3 hrs.
ÇAR was dropped off 9.30am.
I was rang at 9.50 to say they would need it for an extra hour. Ok
No call to say ÇAR ready at 1.00pm or 2.00pm or at all.
Go back to garage 2.40pm wait for another hour!
Before ÇAR appears.
Had to cancel client I was meeting in Guildford.
Very Disappointing service from BMW
Not at all happy"
7/23/18,5,No nonesense approach. The salesman understood what we wanted and how much we could pay. We got a good deal and got what we wanted without messing about or wasting time.
7/23/18,5,"Very punctual/professional/through service, some might say that’s what you get with Mercedes and I’m just reinforcing this, excellent team well done and keep it up"
7/23/18,5,Great service from start to finish from Tom. Whole experience was great and it’s just a shame I don’t live near as I would be definitely using them for servicing.
7/23/18,1,"Wanted to trade my Z1000 in for a S1000r was told to email some pictures as it was January and bad weather. Waited ten days got no reply so I phoned the salesman and he did not remember any details.
So after I got my S1000r elsewhere I hade a fault with the paint work went to coopers as they are my local dealer three times and was told it was in the hands of BMW never heard anything else so the panels were sent to a well known bike spray shop came back as they should have been 1 to the spray shop BMW 0 for service."
7/23/18,5,"Very courteous and friendly staff. I brought my car in 15 minutes before my scheduled appointment and was seen by my allotted time. They said it would take 90 minutes and my car was returned to me within this time looking like new. Was very impressed with the service and liked the fact that Josh, who sold me my car originally came over to say hello. I’ve no reservations in regards to recommending this branch to any friend or family looking for a car in the future."
7/23/18,2,"Unfortunately I did not have a good experience at Mini on this occasion. My car was due an MOT at the same time as the service (of which is covered under a service package I have) so naturally I took it to Mini for both. I was shocked to hear my car failed its MOT because the drivers seat, despite being fully manoeuvrable in the upright driving position, did not slide forwards on its runners when tilted forward to give access to the back seats - I cannot understand how this makes the car unsafe to be on the roads, nor a risk to other road users, and naturally I was charged a large labour fee to reconnect a loose cable and get it working again. I shall use my service package up but I will be going elsewhere for future MOTs."
7/23/18,5,I cannot fault the excellent service received from Nick Sandhu. Nick was extremely helpful and made the task of buying my new car a pleasure.
7/23/18,5,"Great friendly team - our sales person Jack was lovely and looked after us well. Good choice of cars and as they are a group, there is a wider choice as they will bring a car over from one of their other dealerships for you.
When there was a last minute problem with the car I was trading in, they were professional, and fair."
7/23/18,5,Very efficient and kept me informed of the status of my Mercedes car
7/23/18,4,"Very good experience, after being let down by two other Jaguar dealers.

The salesman, Alan, was great. He made the entire process as simple as possible and I came away with the deal I wanted and it was a stress free experience. I could not have asked for more!

I would not hesitate to use this dealership again."
7/23/18,5,"Tim Irons,our salesperson very helpful and gave time to view the car.Valuation of px car acceptable and no pressure to take finance,gap insurance etc when offered.Bought a premium car for same money as
Mainstream competition."
7/23/18,5,Just bought an Audi A3 from the Macclesfield branch. Couldn’t folt anything! Was all so quick and easy! Kimberley the sales person who delt with me did one of the best jobs I’ve seen. Always so quick too relply too emails and when it came to the days I came into the garage she was straight to the desk too talk about it within minutes! Also went into every little detail you could ask for didn’t even need too ask any questions as she covered everything! Really brilliant job!
7/23/18,5,"EXCELLENT SERVICE WITH NO PRESSURE APPLIED.
EVERYTHING WAS DONE TO A HIGH DEGREE OF SATISFACTION.
CAR WAS READY AND SPOTLESS.
WOULD RECOMEND A VISIT."
7/23/18,5,"Excellant sales man, very helpful and friendly would deffinately recommend."
7/23/18,4,"Disappointed that having transferred full payment three days before collection by CHAPS that when we arrived at the dealership on Saturday to collect the accounts department had not confirmed with the sales department that funds had been received, therefore unless I could prove payment then my 2 hour journey would have been wasted.
However as I have internet banking I could demonstrate that the funds were with Inchcape.

I would have appreciated a call to warn me of the situation.


On driving from the dealership I noticed a mark on the windscreen which is a small stone chip and I am awaiting a call from the dealership to discuss how this can be remedied, also the valet was not of a very good standard, apart from that the car is great but I feel attention too detail was lacking."
7/23/18,5,"Never been let down, service is always first class"
7/23/18,5,"The staff were attentive and helpful, explaining the various options and features of the car - delighted so far with my new car - the second I’ve bought from the Inchcape group."
7/23/18,5,"I have just had my car delivered and from starting the process to the end it was a delight dealing with such a professional organisation.
Many thanks to Chris for all his expert advice and I wouldn’t hesitate in recommending this dealership."
7/23/18,2,"I found the service assistant assigned to me rude, she was unable to explain why the website did not work in the assumed manner and kept talking over me. Very defensive attitude rather than trying to find an acceptable solution. The contact has shown BMW in a bad light to me, so much so that I will probably not get a BMW the next time I change my car. I will probably go to Mercedes.

I have a BMW 520d and the on board service instruction stated that I had to have an oil and micro filter change at 5800 miles. Something that I think is unacceptable in a (fairly) new car."
7/23/18,5,"I had previously visited another Toyota showroom but did not receive the great service I received at Inchcape in Guildford James was absolutely brilliant He knew exactly what I wanted and was able to help me with my purchase I am very pleased with my car He was very professional and knowledgable
Brilliant"
7/23/18,1,No customer service. Drop the car off and told return to return in two hours. Receive a call after one hour saying the part has not arrived. Complete waste of time.
7/23/18,5,excellent well explained andvery helpfull
7/23/18,5,"Very efficient, very informative"
7/23/18,4,Sales man was great - very responsive to emails. Only slight issue was a longish wait for the car to be ready.
7/23/18,5,"Took my CLA into the Liverpool central Mercedes garage for its first service. Booked a one hour service slot online. Great service, could not fault."
7/23/18,5,Everything went to plan on timing and feedback on the MOT. Excellent service. Video was v.good.
7/23/18,2,"Poor Experience - This is not my first experience with your dealership - to arrive for a service and be told that you do not have a courtesy car available (when one is booked) is completely unacceptable..
To be left sitting for over two hours, when I have things to do, that is why a car was booked, not even offered a drink, car not cleaned properly, still issues un-resolved, I expected to be treated almost OTT this time, but no, you clearly don't care - the chap who dealt with me, Phil? was very professional and apologetic, but that does not excuse the poor experience AGAIN. Last Mercedes I get, back to BMW."
7/23/18,5,Excellent Service and very friendly staff!!!
7/23/18,2,Poor attention to detail and poor service. Inadequate car buying experience and does not meet Jaguar’s standards!
7/22/18,5,We was warmly welcomed into the showroom. Mark was expecting us as arranged previously by telephone. Everything was ready to go for my test drive in the jaguar xf r sport estate. Which I purchased and I love already.Great professionalism great knowledge and extremely patient on my test drive because I had never driven an automatic before.... let's just say my emergency stop was very impressive ....but mark was not phased at all.... I would recommend this dealership without hesitation to anyone wanting to buy a jaguar. Pleasure to deal with thank you mark for your help....
7/22/18,5,"I have been a customer of Inchcape for many years now and have always received the most courteous and helpful attention from their personnel.
After the recent last service and MOT, I was surprised and impressed to receive by email, a comprehensive video of the exhaust, tyres, brake pads, etc, the latter items detailing the wear on each.
I was also kept informed of parts required (and the cost!!!) to obtain a pass of the MOT!!"
7/22/18,5,Professional and caring approach from all the staff encountered at H A Fox in Southampton last week ! Thanks guys and Girls!
7/21/18,5,It's the first time I've been to Inchcape and the lady on the front desk was so polite always asking if we needed a drink or something to read. I found the whole experience very friendly. I will be using your services again. Thank you.
7/21/18,5,"Very helpful and friendly service, would recommend"
7/21/18,5,"A great service from all the team at Cooper Mini in Reading. Buying a new car from them was such a breath of fresh air, well I did end up with a JCW convertible! Everyone bent over backwards to provide a first rate service for my wife and I. Stephanie was brilliant in finding out what our needs were and helping us to choose the right car for us. She made us relaxed with her style and knowledge. Cooper Reading had so many cars to choose from (new and used), that made the decision process easier as you could see all the variants in one place. A cracking deal was made and the whole buying process was a dream. Cooper Reading is so in tune with the MINI brand and philosophy it was a lively and cool place to be at.
Thank you all for such a wonderful service, no wonder you are number 1."
7/21/18,5,Efficient friendly service.
7/21/18,5,This is the first time we have considered buying a Toyota. We were made very welcome. It was Jodie who showed us around. Nothing was too much trouble. We could take as much time as we needed and Jodie answered all of our questions. She was not at all pushy. We were so impressed that we went back to see her and have indeed purchased a car from her. Would definitely recommend her to anyone. Would also like to thank the lady on reception. Again nothing was too much trouble and she made excellent coffee!
7/21/18,5,Efficient friendly service refreshments offered and courtesy car if necessary thank you
7/21/18,5,"My car was picked up from my home at 8am, service completed, recall completed and car delivered back about 5pm, all done, fantastic!"
7/21/18,5,From the moment we walked into the Tonbridge Mini branch we felt welcome. Clare Pepper has excellent knowledge of the Mini brand and was great at recommending things that I hadn't even thought of. I was adamant that I wanted a dark green Mini but after talking with Clare and listening to what she had to say I changed my mind. Clare was so good at making us feel relaxed and even on the test drive she showed me what the Mini can do!! I would definitely recommend Mini in Tonbridge as everyone was so welcoming in fact I already have done!
7/21/18,5,Excellent communication and customer service from beginning to end! Would highly recommend this dealer
7/21/18,5,I recommend all people because you are very good
7/20/18,5,Brilliant service again from vw Swindon. Each time they've had my car they have been excellent.
7/20/18,5,Quick and efficient service.
7/20/18,3,"good dealership overall, a few issues with communications, a slight lack of care with the cars mileage description and a rather chaotic/unprofessional handover, I would recommend with some reservations if you are buying from a distance"
7/20/18,3,"very good service very well organised waiting area beautifull very comfortable very good drinks offerd and services were good .
The only point in want to make about the service charges bit unreasionable .which is replaces automatic transmission fluid charge of £156.00 PLUS VAT which was not necessary to charge as the milage on car was 17413 miles and you only change at 77000 miles . In was not very happy to pay that amount and think it should be refunded
I look forward to hearing from you

7/20/18,1,"Called in today at around 1030am to book the car in for an oil change..... nothing difficult. After taking my details the receptionist asked me to take a seat and told me that someone would be with me shortly...... she went over to an empty desk and placed a post-it note on it..... I picked up the local paper, started to read it, and by the time I has got 50% of the way through it (at least 10 minutes later, I guess) I looked around for the umpteemth time, nobody came back to the empty desk, noted that two other clerks in the Service area were still tapping their keyboards and conferring occasionally..... but they were not interested in anything in the waiting area..... I gave up. Like them, I just couldn't be bothered. What other garage/dealership takes ten minutes plus just to book an oil change?
Wasn't even offered a coffee while I waited!
Finally, despite them having my details, and having used them quite a few times previously, nobody bothered to pick up the phone to contact me!
Clearly, they have absolutely ZERO skills when it comes to Customer Service.
They seem to think that we owe them a living? Wrong!
Managers of the Customer Service Department and Vehicle Service Department take note - could do (alot) better!
THREE DAYS LATER, on Monday
AUDI respond via TrustPilot!
Still no contact from any representative of Tunbridge Wells Audi - they must all have long necks in dark places, rendering phones impossible to use?"
7/20/18,5,"Great servicing experience. I waited whilst the service was being undertaken. Lovely showroom to wait in with complimentary drinks. The service took the exact amount of time that I was advised it would take and I even got a video at the end showing me under my car , the tread on my tyres and the wear in my break pads - would definitely recommend as a service centre."
7/20/18,5,Excellent service through out my car buying experience would definatly go back in the future
7/20/18,4,"Pretty good on the whole. Would be good to receive a reminder the day before a service, especially if your car is being collected. Also, I had been informed that my car required a part upgrade that was going to be covered by BMW and that this would be done during the service, unfortunately the work couldn't be completed as apparently the car must have less than half a tank of fuel in order to carry out the repair - I was never told this and I'll now need to arrange another time for this to be done which is somewhat inconvenient. Some forward planning should have been made/advised"
7/20/18,5,Excellent service and communication
7/20/18,5,Excellent service especially from Yolanta
7/20/18,5,"Friendly speedy, and did a good job of the service"
7/20/18,2,"This might be just me but I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth having spent £366 for a service on my a5. The service itself I wouldn’t expect to notice anything different in the way the car drives as it was just a oil and filter change with health check, so I assume audi carried these tasks out and was happy with the job they carried out. (Even though you wouldn’t notice if they had or hadn’t)
However the service also comes with a wash and vacuum included. This I was left very disappointed; the car now has swirl marks all over it. And the wheels don’t look like they’ve been cleaned just jet washed. As I said before this might just be me but I take great care when washing my car 2 bucket rule with grit filter. Clean mitts and dry cloths etc, wanting my car to look the best it possibly can and in a showroom condition. I now have a very tedious and time consuming task of polishing out the swirl marks.
Maybe I just expected a little more from audi and expected a little more attention to detail and more care to be carried out by a so called premium brand. It must be noted that my partner dropped and picked up the car as I would of gone back into the dealership to express my disappointment, but my partner is a little less confrontational than me. That being said my partner was dealt with politely and offered a drink, but I will not be using audi cheshire oaks again or if I do will be requesting them not to wash the vehicle.
I feel I may aswell have taken my vechicle to a local non audi garage and paid half the price with less dissapoontment"
7/20/18,5,I was attended by service depart within 5 minutes of my arrival. A very company does that in these days.
7/20/18,5,"Nice clean showroom, friendly staff, great sales reps (not too pushy)...and the cars are great!"
7/20/18,5,"Pleased with finished vehicle and communication during time at servicing.
Especially thank you to person who left lost money on dashboard."
7/20/18,5,"I have recently brought a 4 Series BMW from CooperBMW Norwich, the salesman Jake Gladding provided exceptional service from start to finish!
No pushy sales tactics, and honest approach to selling the car was great!

The car is fantastic, and pricing was spot on!

I will be recommending to family and friends, and I will be back in the future!

7/20/18,1,"Like all these dealerships (or is it just Inchcape?) you can NEVER get through to someone on the telephone. I wanted parts for my son's VW, but they just don't answer the phone, and you always end up with a 'receptionist' who can't help you. Then they never phone you back.
Please don't tell me to contact tellusmore(a)inchcape.co.uk because I've done that for my BMW following a complaint and heard absolutely nothing back. It's just a way of making your social media complaints look like they were handled!"
7/20/18,1,"Nearly brand new Q2 purchased end of April. Spent nearly 27k . Repeatedly fobbed off . Calls ignored. Promises not kept. Jad being the main culprit and now his manager. Really so disappointed . We complained and given promise of payment up to £100 for a meal. Let us try and make it up to you they said. Tried to get them to pay me back as they promised. They ignore my e mails ! Wasted so much time and energy with this absolute shower. No more. Wish we had never given them a single penny. Will never go back or use Audi TW for servicing. Avoid like the plague. Had a Toyota before. St Leonard’s Toyota were brilliant. Never should have gone to this lot but I thought we were buying a premium brand with a premium retailer.
Update. Following this review and e mailing their customer services address as below, they have now paid me the £100. I am grateful for that but a day late and a dollar short as the saying goes. I am told the staff no longer with the business. Nothing to do with me but perhaps other issues. Either way they need to do much better. I won’t be back."
7/20/18,2,"I took my car into Thames Ditton on the 17/7/18 for an mot and service/health check.
A video informed me that the oil needed to be topped up which I assumed would be done.
Subsequently the oil warning light came on and I topped up the oil.Can you confirm if you topped up the oil or am I burning oil. The car passed the mot and you were sending me a report confirming tyre depths etc.I am still awaiting the report..Also, I had to wait 30 minutes when I dropped the car off and when I picked the car up in the afternoon.
This is not acceptable to me.
Regards, Robert Silva"
7/20/18,3,Very good experience with car salesman but poor follow up by company due to incorrect data being recorded
7/19/18,1,"Following a recent review of this company I had a request to provide my details so that they can ""investigate"" their poor service provided. Have a little look at what happened when I tried to provide my details for them to pay their lip-service and grovel insincerely....what a joke they can't even get this right!

7/19/18,1,"Terrible from the word go! Called the number via their website to books service and rung off the hook. Emailed via website and didn’t get a response within 2 weeks. Walked into Showroom and cannot book services at site you have to call. They gave me a different number to call and booked a service with much needed courtesy car.
Arrived at site to be moved twice to the desk I was being served. Courtesy car scrubbed out! Upon questioning i was told I had a text to tell me! I had 30 mins before I arrived at the booked time. I had not read it as I was on the normal rush around morning routine. They can get me a taxi. Ok I say. Go to other desk. Oh, taxis are 30 mins at least. A driver is coming back in 5 mins and he can drop you, please take another seat! 25mins gone by! Any news on the driver to the other receptionist! What driver, I will call you a cab! Blah, blah, blah. Guy took me to Mini and shouted at the receptionist there - sort him a car out! He then informs me once other guy has left that they don’t have any. No drivers either. I will take you back over. Then he has a mini paddy and then gives me a set of keys to the ‘Managers’ car!
Go home. 3 hours later. Car is ready. Ok, that’s quick. I will get there when I can as I am in a meeting. 2 hours later I turn up to pick the car up.
Paid up all ok. I will bring the car around for you. Comes back 10 mins later. It’s in the valet area, will be 15mins is that ok? Yes, as it was filthy!
30mins later, what is going on?
He runs off and brings the car back!
Not seemless and lost loads of time that day that I cannot get back!
Audi, Porsche never have anything like any of these issues above. None of them!
Crazy from start to finish!"
7/19/18,5,"Had a problem with TPMS tyre valve - fitted in without an appointment.
Everything very well explained - problem resolved. Can only praise their excellent service."
7/19/18,5,very good service
7/19/18,5,"Excellent customer care, a professional hassle free experience."
7/19/18,3,"Very pleasant staff, especially the driver, and accommodating when I changed my collection address.

Frustrating that the drier was sent to the incorrect address, thus delaying collection. This then delayed the return, and meant my car was not washed. This is my second service here and is the second time I did not get my car washed.

The video message summarising the service is a good idea, shame I couldn't hear any of what was said due to the radio in the background."
7/19/18,1,"Loan car supplied was filthy dirty and on reserve fuel level - given the distance to the nearest fuel station this was inexcusable.
Upon returning at the prearranged collection time I waited for 15 minutes as the service person was with another customer When she came over was told my car wasnt ready and to come back tomorrow.
TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME that could have been avoided with a simple phone call.

Aftersales Director is rude enough to not return my calls

NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS MERCEDES FRANCHISE AT ALL.

I would honestly recommend that if you can book your car in somewhere else then do so!"
7/19/18,5,"Great service, great atmosphere and care in the showroom"
7/19/18,5,"efficient, polite and thanks for cleaning my car."
7/19/18,5,"Excellent service, polite and accommodating, my service was carried out efficiently while I waited, I was able to continue working remotely thanks to a desk, coffee and Wi-fi."
7/19/18,5,Excellent attentive service - I would recommend the company
7/19/18,5,"Amazing effort to solve the problem which was caused by Apple upgrade that put a filter on contacts.

7/19/18,5,very good response rep could not have done more to answer queries. Went out of his way to help
7/19/18,5,"Super service. Needed 2 recalls jobs, loan car provided and valet and wash thrown in and no charge!"
7/18/18,5,Professional and courteous with attention to detail. Excellent facilities and the ability to be able to watch the work being carried out on your car if you want to. Waiting area is very comfortable with good drinks facilities. Courtesy car offered if required and complementary car wash after service. Mercedes Benz has to lead others with the standards they offer.
7/18/18,5,Incredibly helpful and efficient staff.
7/18/18,4,"I had a great experience at Cooper Norwich mini center.

They had a great selection of cars, and a good price range to suit most if not all budgets.

I was looking for something a little sporty, so checked the website for Mini Cooper S models, and that’s where I found one that ticked all the boxes. The price was right around my budget, and I was very supprised at the fuel economy.

I booked a test drive for the next day, and the next morning had a call from Scott, confirming the test drive I requested. Upon arriving at the show room I was impressed with the layout, and being able to freely browse around with out being pounced on as soon as you arrive. We headed to the reception to let them know we was there, and was the shortly greeted by Scott. He was very pleasant and at no point did I feel pressured that I had to buy.

In the test drive he asked what the car would be mostly used for, and what the road conditions where like where I would be driving. He then directed us on route that very closely matched the roads in my area, this showed off the potential of what the car would be like, and yes I was impressed.

After the test drive we worked out some figures on the cars price and finance, when they where done, I was free to go away and have a think while walking around the show room. When I was ready I went back and agreed to the deal, and can’t wait to pick up my new car.

All I can say is you won’t get better service else where, and you are never pressured into anything. Great service and sales team, in fact I’m thinking of getting a second one for my wife."
7/18/18,5,"Had a couple of recalls on my BMW and things could not of been made easier. Polite professional staff, all work carried out quickly."
7/18/18,5,"Very helpful, good folllow up on a timely basis and price bettered elsewhere"
7/18/18,5,"A simple service and collection and delivery went very smoothly.
No problems and car was well presented afterwards."
7/18/18,4,excellent service but extremely expensive
7/18/18,5,car was serviced and valeted within 2 hours. Excellent customer service.
7/18/18,5,"Collected my car in the morning at the time they said they would, sent me a video of what they were doing and what was needed then washed and vacuumed my car and returned it to me early afternoon. Excellent service thank you."
7/18/18,5,My car was taken for its MOT as soon as I arrived on time and on completion all was explained clearly including the bill and I was able to get on my way.
7/18/18,5,great service; no issues
7/18/18,5,"As always a great service experience at Inchcape Llandudno Junction. Mandy was extremely helpful and a pleasure to deal with. I find the service from all the team excellent, thank you."
7/18/18,3,Personnel supported the process but were clearly overloaded. Not my best visit.
7/18/18,5,"Excellent service, as usual. Lovely to be greeted by members of staff I have known for 12 years or more (but rarely see!).
Rather nice to get a short video clip of part of the service checks on my tyres and brakes.
Felt very well looked after - thank you Cooper BMW Norwich!"
7/17/18,5,"I turned to Inchcape Guildford (Land Rover) to sort out a warranty issue (!) with my LR having had enough of the astonishingly poor service from the supplying dealership in Thames Ditton. It has put my faith back into the JLR support network. They were prompt, courteous and professional. I would recommend Guildford to all LR/Jaguar owners in SW London/Surrey who think they have to put up with a shoddy service from their dealer."
7/17/18,5,Personal and efficient service. Highly recommended.
7/17/18,1,"We hope your recent visit to Mercedes-Benz of Leicester exceeded your expectations.

PROBLEM, I haven't visited Mercedes-Benz of Leicester in over 10 years."
7/17/18,5,I was impressed because the Mini central booking call centre had mistakenly booked my car into Tonbridge when I specified Tunbridge Wells. Staff at Tunbridge Wells sympathised & made an effort to service my car on time as per my original request.
7/17/18,5,"The service I received was very friendly, efficient and professional. I will be using BMW Cobham again."
7/17/18,5,"Took my car in for re-call was greeted by Phil, who is an absolute credit to Mercedes Ellesmere port."
7/17/18,5,"From the time I booked my Mini in for a service and MOT to the time my car was returned I could not have asked for better service.
The staff in all areas were very helpful and made the whole process very easy."
7/17/18,5,Always very attentive... never had a bad experience I am a returning customer and felt as valued as I did on my very first visit
7/17/18,5,"BMW Cooper Croydon came and collected my car for me on time - earlier than expected to be fair, fixed the problem and dropped it back all washed nice and clean. Very happy with the driver and the telephone staff. Thank you"
7/17/18,5,An excellent experience from your welcome to end of service briefing. It seems your well being is as important as your cars. Well done Coopers.
7/17/18,5,Jon Taylor at Coopers of Norwich gave us outstanding service. It was our daughters 21st he helped us locate a mini and really looked after us.He also made a very special memory for my daughter when we went to collect it. Excellent service would recommend them to all friends and family. Thankyou Jon.
7/17/18,5,"Could not have asked for a better car buying experience! Lots of stock on site of all the models I was interested in, and friendly, helpful staff to show me round them. No hard sell, or pushy salesman. Got my car ready for delivery really quickly, and I couldn't be happier with it. Will definitely be going back when it's time to change again!"
7/17/18,5,"They do an excellent job, my car was on a safety recall / software update which was completed on the day of its allotted appointment. Job done, washed and sorted - cant ask for more- recommended.
However the ""Booking in and collection procedure"" can be rather protracted."
7/16/18,2,"I called Crewe Audi and spoke to Katie who was extremely impolite when I told her what I wanted to speak with a member of staff about. Stated he was busy but that she would email him DC. I have received nothing via email and doubt DC has been informed of my call. She has a total couldn't care less attitude.

I called Inchcapeaudi central service centre to try to get some better assistance.
Nathan was a total contrast to Katie, professional and charming, taking time to fully answer my questions and book a service for me at Chester Audi next week, which initially we thought was possible.

I was connected to Tirran at driver line who had no details of any service plan in place connected to my vehicle. He passed me through to

Hardeep at Audi HQ.
to double check the service agreement and for the second time was told that my vehicle was showing as 'non maintained' when I have a service plan agreement, have every single made regular payment have all confirmation of that and yet it could not be found.

I provided the agreement reference number which meant nothing at all to Hardeep who then put me on hold to find the service plan.

I spent 22 minutes in total on the phone, was placed on hold 3 separate times for at least 10 of those minutes, waiting for Hardeep to find my service plan. He eventually came back and said I would have to call Crewe Audi again. They could not help.

I have been paying 25.52 per month for the service and yet the central service team have absolutely no knowledge of a service plan sold by Crewe Audi.

I called Crewe Audi whilst on hold again and got through to Katie on reception who, when I asked to speak to a member of staff rudely said 'yeah, just a mo' and put me on hold. No 'sorry for the inconvenience after me explaining that I had unsuccessfully tried to sort out the detail of my plan with Chester and Inchcape central services for the last 30 mins, surely out of common courtesy she could at least be polite?

Jack from the sales team was a complete contrast and hugely helpful (five stars) but told me that the agreement I took out only allowed me to have the car serviced at Crewe. I had no idea of this as at the time I worked in Worcestershire so would never had agreed to that had I known its limitations geographically. I now live in N.Wales, it is therefore impossible during working hours/days to take my vehicle to Crewe. Jack took my details and said that, as I have built up a pot of money via my payments since March 2016 to EmAC (28 x payments of £25.18 so far) , he would try to arrange an alternative to me having to somehow get the vehicle to Crewe. Nothing confirmed as yet.

So far, I have been trying to sort this issue out for one hour and still do not have a service booked under the agreement which will cost me a total of £881.64 over the duration.

At least I have faith in Jack, although still no service booked one hour and 15 minutes since my first call to Katie at Crewe Audi.

The two stars re Nathan and Jack, other than that the service is non-existent."
7/16/18,4,Cheshire Oaks Mercedes Benz met all the standards I would expect a Mercedes Benz main dealership to meet. I will certainly use them again and would therefore not hesitate to recommend them to other Mercedes customers.
7/16/18,3,"Car came back very dusty inside with lots of finger marks!!
I will try once more or may end up going back to Audi (5 Stars)"
7/16/18,5,"Cooper Tonbridge has one of the best services that I have ever had from a car dealer. They are professional, friendly and efficient for both pre-sale and after-sale services. AAA+ Star. Highly recommend!!!"
7/16/18,1,"Went to the Mini garage for a test drive... it was the worst customer service experience I encountered. The lady who ""took care"" of us was unfriendly, she replied to all my questions with ""I don't know"". When we did the test drive, she just sat at the back and said nothing. Then, as I was interested in the car, but had some questions, she just rolled her eyes. Not sure what was her problem, but in the end, I did not buy the car because of her! I would never give someone so lazy and rude a commission. O top of this, she said, give me a call Monday if you are interested. I did call Monday to say I was not, but was told she was on holiday... so basically the worst salesperson ever! I did talk to a manager to share my experience, but nobody called me back to understand more about this situation."
7/15/18,5,"I was looking for a small car for work and managed to find one within my price range at Inchcape Toyota - Guildford. The Sales Executive I spoke to was Mr Matthew Hayes. He was very professional and helpful throughout the whole process from arranging a test drive, going through the buying process to the handover of the vehicle.

Two days after collecting the car, Matthew also contacted me via email to see how I was getting on the with the car, which I thought was nice of him.

I also have to give a big shout out to Mr Graeme Shore (Aftersales Executive) who is also based at Inchcape Toyota - Guildford. Mr Shore was also very professional when we spoke about the warranty side of the vehicle.

Overall, I am very happy with the service and staff at Inchcape Toyota - Guildford. Thank you :)"
7/15/18,5,Couldn't be more helpfull. Great experience will return!!
7/15/18,5,"From test drive to driving away with the new car was quite a pleasant experience.
The test drive was good and the features of the car were explained by the sales executive.
I would recommend Macclesfield Audi, we travelled 50 miles to find the right used car but it was well worth the trip.

Pete and Liz Butler."
7/15/18,5,Great service from start to finish. Martin was spot on in terms of meeting my requirements and was very clear and honest with me throughout the process. Well and truly above and beyond
7/15/18,5,"It was only an MOT, my car is due to be serviced in August as part of the 5 year warranty. However it was finished, together with a couple of checks i'd asked them to make, in good time, car cleaned and valeted too. Fab!"
7/14/18,5,As always the customer service was excellent and an efficient service
7/14/18,5,The treatment I have experienced from the Mini Dealership in Norwich has always been exceptional. They go out of their way to accommodate your wishes and are so helpful. I cannot recommend them enough.
7/14/18,5,Good service and detailed feedback
7/14/18,5,"Great service, couldn't do enough for you, everything that I asked for was done no problem. explained every possible ways of finance services etc. Contacted me to keep me informed, picked up car on date.
excellent."
7/14/18,5,I found Mercedes-Benz Oxford to be very helpful and the sale of our car very smooth. Stuart was very helpful throughout the whole process.
7/14/18,5,I was very impressed with Andy Plant's attention. A very good test drive and all the necessary information freely given which enabled me to make an on-the-spot purchase of a lovely used Z4 which (on collection) had been brought up to a very high standard of readiness by the service department. Would heartily recommend!
7/13/18,5,"Just bought my new car, really pleased with her. The service at Mini Cooper, Malton was excellent, nothing was too much trouble and they kept me up to date through the whole process. Would totally recommend them for the purchase of a car."
7/13/18,4,Great experience 1st time buying from this dealer would recommend
7/13/18,5,Prompt professional and extremely helpful
7/13/18,4,All went as planned
7/13/18,5,"Sales person did very well to try to make up for a basically very poor cumbersome system. I spent some 12 hrs over three appointments
to buy the car I wanted. Very nearly walked out in disgust, only the fact that the car I wanted was a bit rare, that stopped me!!"
7/13/18,4,"BMW Car Service - Thames Ditton

I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the problem they had that prevented my car being washed after the service!

Had to replace a tyre during the service and got a good price too.

I would recommend this dealer without a problem.."
7/13/18,5,Amazing salesman Adam and manager joe.
7/13/18,5,The service at Inchcape Cheshire Oaks is excellent. Particular mention for Jay Wake. For a young man his knowledge and enthusiasm is really good and he goes that extra mile to help. My experience while purchasing my 6th new car for them was first class.
7/13/18,4,"I have been taking my mini back to cooper nowich fir it’s servining, MOT and other car related issues ever since I bought it. Their service and attention to customer service is good and I’m pleased with the overall way they deal with me. The only thing that has let them down in recent times is not re setting my service due indicator, which has meant having to return to them so this can be addressed, this has now happened twice."
7/13/18,5,"Excellent experience from beginning to end. I booked my car in for a routine service and MOT, although I did not buy the car from this dealer. All the staff were helpful and pleasant throughout. They provided useful information without being pushy about selling stuff you neither want nor need. All round very professional - I shall definitely be going back there."
7/13/18,5,Efficient service. Courteous staff and did everything they said they would do and at the price quoted.
7/13/18,4,I knew the car I wanted so went to CooperBMW Reading. Very pleasant and professional Sales Person (Abby) went through options available and quickly I decided to go ahead and trade in my BMW320 and place my order. The 420i was in stock and I took delivery two weeks later. I'm thrilled with the new car!
7/13/18,5,Really helpful and very professional service
7/13/18,5,"Great experience at Swindon Audi, Gareth was lovely, smart, courteous and efficient. He didn’t do the hard sell and the whole experience was excellent."
7/13/18,5,Very helpful and informative. They go out of their way to look after you from the moment you walk in to the moment you drive home in your new car. Very happy with the service and my new vehicle.
7/13/18,5,"Fantastic experience when recently ordering and picking up my new car! Really can’t recommend the Chester branch highly enough. The ‘customer experience’ is vital with car dealerships, Chester Inchcape recognise this and make sure all customers have a positive experience when visiting. Ashley Brear in particular went above and beyond and made sure I was well informed and looked after at every stage. Thank you very much to Ashley and the rest of the team at Chester Inchcape! 👍🏻"
7/13/18,5,Fantastic service. The staff were most helpful from my initial enquiry about a new car to assisting with the finance and the salesman even coming in on his day off to hand the car over to me. First class!!
7/12/18,5,First time visit to the Chelmsford branch having always used Colchester in the past but no available dates here to suit so went to Chelmsford. First rate service with a smile. Very impressed.
7/12/18,5,"After been refused a slot for a service at Stockton BMW due to vehicle call backs and the fact I was told it would be August before I could get a service I was offered Durham BMW as an alternative. As it happened I fancied a day out in Durham luckily. I arrived and found the staff to be more than helpful Michelle had everything planned even down to a lift into Durham city whilst the car was serviced and cleaned . Needless to say when I returned a few hours later after a call from Michelle the car was waiting to be taken. Everything was explained what was done to the car and any issues like a few dents in my sump. They even sent me a video to show where it was ,excellent idea . All I can say for this experience I would have no objections in going back to Durham although it is a trek from Middlesbrough and I did actually purchase the car from Stockton branch. Great job Durham Branch."
7/12/18,5,BMW Cooper Malton did the warranty work on my car.They were very efficient and professional in their dealings with me from start to finish.The ladies and the technicians they have are a credit and took time to answer my questions.
7/12/18,3,Car wasn’t ready when I went to collect it and had no fuel in it
7/12/18,5,Superb customer service - helped with everything I needed and made the whole experience/process of purchasing a new vehicle comfortable and smooth.
7/12/18,5,"Excellent service would highly recommend, great customer service, friendly and polite staff"
7/12/18,4,"I have received very good service from the team at Inchcape UK, very happy to recommend them."
7/12/18,5,"Tony Kelly was so helpful in helping us choose the right car for us, and then made the whole process really easy. He kept in touch via email, and from first test driving on Sunday morning, we took delivery on Wednesday morning"
7/12/18,5,"No negatives here - Submitted my mini for a full inspection. All persons involved on my visit handled my request in a professional capacity.
Because of this i have re-booked the mini at the dealership to have
work carried out post inspection. I will also use the dealership for future servicing / mot etc..

Many thanks - Tony Panayiotou"
7/12/18,2,I received a call day before service saying that they had a huge backlog of cars and perhaps I would like to re-book!! Not even possible as my MOT was expiring. They have not changed the brake fluid although this is showing as being due soon. I had to wait 45 minutes for my car to be washed after having been told to pick it up. Overall not a good experience. Must do better!!
7/12/18,5,very good and efficient would totally recommend.
7/12/18,5,Great service. Very helpful and excellent value for money. Looked after me very well.
7/12/18,5,"The service offered was very good. There was no bartering like you often get with local car selling services. I was offered a fair price for my old car and the service was very professional.

Lauren was very good. There was no pressure selling or awkwardness. The service was efficient and enjoyable.

It would be nice to give customers a complimentary AMG keyring or something as a good will gesture when purchasing a car."
7/12/18,5,"Very welcoming, efficient and friendly."
7/11/18,5,"Very pleased with the service I received today from Coopers Ipswich.
I walked in with no appointment and was seen within a short period and my car was fixed there and then.
Thank you Coopers."
7/11/18,5,"I was initially a little nervous about going in for not only a new car but a lease one. A friend who had had a positive experience with leasing from Inchcape Kidlington introduced me to the idea. My husband and I hadn't had a car for nearly 4 years following him writing off our Honda. With ill health and constant hospital visits we both felt it worth considering getting a car this way.
Delighted with the outcome and the staff experience was excellent . Just getting used to driving most days again and the Aygo is a great little car.
Would recommend Inchcape, car and great service to anyone."
7/11/18,5,It was very professionally handled straight forward and tailored to the individual’s needs. Very warm and welcoming.
7/11/18,5,Excellent customer service
7/11/18,1,"Very bad customer experience
Staff were generally courteous but hopelessly incompetent
Very frustrating experience and would not recommend"
7/11/18,4,"Nice coffee, pleasant staff, a bit pushy with the extras but that's expected. Only downside so far is cars maps out of date, for the price paid I would expect everything to be updated. If the maps aren't is the main car firmware upto date?"
7/11/18,1,"BMW Ipswich , not a nice experience ,used to be 100% customer service , now there is not any ,all the good staff have left and new staff clueless of customer service , shocking , was told an hour for a service , when arrived no where to park full of cars ,clearly not selling many as no decent car sales team , when arrived was informed two hour wait ,used to be offered free lift back ,courtesy car or a taxi ,but not any more , waited 3 hours no hot beverage offered , complained about the wait , elderly gentlemen Paul ,eventually went to see why taken so long , was just left sitting there , three hours later received my car , a young girl took my payment but didn’t know how to explain what I was paying for ,obviously no training , car usually cleaned and valet but oh no car received a cat lick and seem to have forgot to do inside , mot due next month usually they combine the two ,,,well they won’t be doing my mot this year ."
7/11/18,5,"Veru impressed our 1st dealings with them
We willuse them again"
7/11/18,5,Great experience buying a 2nd hand Discovery 4 from Daniel. Very easy and professional throughout. Car as expected with no hidden problems to report.
7/11/18,5,excellent service. thanks to Andy who collected the car and the team in the service department
7/11/18,5,"Stratford Mercedes Benz - Brilliant...

Cannot fault the guys at Stratford Mercedes Benz at all. From the point of walking through the door to collecting our new car two weeks later, the service was second to none. Completely well looked after and their staff are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable and they turned what had been a bad experience into a positive one - a completely different experience to the service we received a few years ago when looking to buy a new car...we went to BMW after that one! However, so glad we decided to give them another try though. If I had to choose one word - excellent!"
7/11/18,3,"Disappointed that radio stations had been changed, excessive mileage on car , 2 dirty seat covers left in car , interior not cleaned, and no response from Email to service advisor"
7/10/18,5,"All work completed, good and professional service."
7/10/18,1,"It seems this service center has gone to worst merc service center. Left the car for service, wait for drop off and pick up was both times over 30 min.
The service manager gave report saying leak of oil and said they can fix when I went for collection, usually it was call while servicing not after completion. Also if leak happen ECM/Car's computer informs as a fault so had to recheck this with other service center. Just wanted to make bills.
They were suppose to clear the car, seems in rush did even poor job with this with lazy vacuum as well as Wash as one can see dirt and moth still attached to car after wash.
Worst thing after service, the car started to make weird noise from somewhere AC duct,
Also there was known rubber coming out of the cabriolet roof, which they didn't even mention in the report- completely missed out which is a very easy fix by glue as glue went loose, Also in the boot a small sping and a platic cover was not fixed as it needed just small glue a min. or less to fix. Didnot even mention in the service report. Its worst experience from Merc centre, halford can do far better job so no point going to merc again."
7/10/18,5,"I went for a test drive with some apprehension as I had owned my previous car for 15yrs but once I spoke to the sales executive (Steve Stephenson) who's car it actually was, I felt at at ease.
Steve told me all about the car and answered any questions I had and was never pushy unlike some dealers who are just out for a quick sale so after a good test drive, I ended up with a new car 😊"
7/10/18,5,"Excellent collection, delivery and service throughout."
7/10/18,3,Everything fine (except for the price which I was aware of but think is very steep for an oil change and cursory look over) .Just one other thing I booked a two hour session when I made the booking with Audi but Simon said it was not recorded as a two hours session although they did ( almost) manage to complete it in two hours
7/10/18,4,Everyone pleasant and polite. Did everything related to my car as expected and kept me informed. One small criticism....loan car on fuel reserve when I left forecourt. Very happy to pay for what I use but do feel cars should be filled before you send out.
7/10/18,5,"Fantastic dealership with some very competent staff.
I deal with a lot of dealers from all different brands and this has been by fair and away the best experience this year. Calls are actually answered, phones calls are returned and both Kishan and Lee were a credit to the dealership.
Vehicle was as described and the process from purchase to collection was just 3 working days so my demands were met.
Keep up the good work."
7/10/18,3,I knew before the car went in that it would need work carrying out went in for a covered service comes out with a huge bill.
7/10/18,5,Loverly lady on service desk very helpful well done 5stars Barry revell
7/10/18,5,"Inchcape Audi Stockport were fantastic, they helped me out with a problem i had that others seemed to struggle to resolve. The customer service i received was second to none and Emma the lady who kept me updated and organised the fix was exceptional. i wish all the people i dealt with was as good as Emma, my life would be far easier."
7/10/18,5,"No hassle , everything explained , ready on time , and overall no hassle . The car has not been a problem over the two years I have owned it ."
7/10/18,3,"Booked in for a ""while you wait"" service, due to delays in getting authority from VW Finance to authorise the service my car was still in the carpark 90 minutes after I arrived. The service should have taken 1 hour Eventually the dealer offered me a courtesy car to go to my office, basically wasted most of the morning.
I will definitely not use this ""while you wait"" service again."
7/10/18,2,"Spelt my surname wrong on some documents, including vehicle change. Got my house number wrong, so unlikely to get some mail.
Was told PCP amount that changed when I collected the car
Whole process took two and half hours - was losing patience
Offered to fill fuel, however only half a tank."
7/10/18,5,"Many thanks for booking me in at such short notice and ... for leaving the cleaned and shiny when you were done. Little things really do make a big difference.
Thanks for the heads-up about the damage to the skirt too. I know I didn't take you up on the offer of getting it repaired but it's nice to know that you are watching out for things that we, as drivers, wouldn't always see."
7/10/18,5,After having bad service at another dealership. I found Audi Stockport fantastic. Will be definitely going back there.
7/10/18,5,"Excellent service
The BMW staff were very helpful and knowledgeable about their cars. They took the time to explain the different features and were keen to get the right deal for me. When the BMW representative said he was going to call he did and when I couldn't get hold of him we corresponded through email which was easy and effective when sorting insurance and discussing the collection date and time. I was very impressed with the service received as previously I had been into BMW and spoken to a very patronising sales representative who kept repeating himself as though I was stupid and didn't understand what he was talking about... Maybe the fact that I'm a women made him feel as through repeating himself would help my little brain take in the information!!!! In fact it actually put me off want to change my car with the dealership in Reading. I can honestly say this time was so much better and I would be very happy in the future to purchase another used car from BMW."

7/9/18,2,"For a premium MB car service I would have expected the adblue in my car you be refilled as standard, considering it does not cost much at all. However was instead told that is an additional cost but in my case they'll make an exception and refill it for free. Not sure if this was a genuine mistake being covered up or it is actually not included in a £300 service!"

Phoned in on the day but the receptionist was not able to give me a pick up time. The actual sertvice etc seemed to go as planned. Just a bit more effort on your customer communications would help so much."

7/9/18,5,"Mercedes Benz - Loughborough. 5* excellent service. When looking for a new MB Dougie, Bryan and the team couldn't have been more helpful.

I would recommend this company to anyone. Thank you guys."
7/9/18,5,My experience of buying a second hand bmw with Cooper BMW at Boldon Colliery was faultless. The whole experience from walking into the premises to leaving with my car was excellent. All staff members were very helpful - especially Tony Foley and Stephen Stephenson.
7/9/18,3,"Had a recall on my car, it's the first Mercedes I have bought due to all the hype about them and customer service. It was extremely difficult to book in. I was told it would only take an hour I could wait or come back. Good job I didn't wait, my wife dropped it off at 8am was stated be back at 2 to collect. 5pm it was ready rubbish service plus dishonest to start before an apology came. Really annoyed."
7/9/18,2,"As a bit of ""sensible"" maintenance I had Cooper Cobham change the alternator belt on my 530D. It promptly broke on my home because it had been wrongly fitted, I believe. I was told to drive it in the next day to have it looked at again, but my battery went flat (no charging) and I was stranded on the A3. The garage could not recover the car and suggested a recovery company and said that they would pay. When I arrived at the garage I had to pay the recovery company, but Coopers said that they would reimburse me later. I am still waiting after three years! I am now having to take the complaint to BMW Customer Services.
Generally the garage is a real pain to deal with. It is really hard to contact anyone by phone and when you do, they tell you that they will do something and then not do it. Parking there is also a nightmare.
Avoid this garage!!"
7/9/18,5,"Just recently purchased a mini from Mini Cooper Durham and the service was fantastic. From the minute I walked into the show room to the minute I drove my new car home.

Christian the sales person explained everything in layman’s terms and was very understanding and helpful. I highly recommend visiting this garage when looking for your next car."

7/7/18,2,"went to view a second hand S-Class Coupe at the Oxford main dealership and liked the car, i had asked for a part exchange price for my car and the salesman said that he would call me that day with a deal. the call did not happen so i called the following day only to discover that they had sold the car to another customer without notifying me or give me the chance for the deal. very dissapointed"
7/7/18,4,"Very good service with regard to picking the car up and dropping back to me. It may sound trivial, but they say they clean the car for you. The inside doesn't appear to have been touched for some reason and the windows are all smeared. Think they shouldn't offer this service if they can't do a good job. They clean the leather seats with a product that turns the black leather into blue streaks. This has happened every time its been cleaned. They deny using any chemicals on it but clean water wouldn't have this affect. Exasperating!!!!!"
7/7/18,4,Great service thanks. 4 star only as tyre pressures not check and set!

7/7/18,5,"Excellent customer service, extremely helpful and knowledgable staff - an entirely pleasant buying experience."
7/6/18,1,"It should be Zero stars for Zero customer service

I never felt the need to write a report until now but on this occasion I am doing.

Where shall I start:

When I went to buy a £40k car where I knew what spec I wanted before I went into the showroom I was treated awfully. I dont think the representative thought I was going to buy a car by the way my wife and I were treated and they showed complete lack of interest. I asked for a test drive a week in advance in a manual and automatic to compare and when I got there there wasnt even a car available to test. I had driven 40 miles round trip. Thats how they sell cars to you. When I received the car after waiting 5 months for it to be delivered that I had specified it was completely the wrong spec. I had a choice of waiting another 3 months or accepting the one they messed up on. In hindsight I wished I hadnt. Buying a new car like this should be an experience. Thats the whole point of paying top dollar. Its one I dont want to repeat for sure.

Next I went in for second service. 42000 miles.

1st time. I was supplied a curtesy car with no fuel. I was told it had a full tank but I was lucky to get off car park. Completely empty - running on fumes. On my return back to pick up the car after a wait for over an hour and half air condioning was not sorted. Apparently due to no air con gas. Tail ram not fixed. Still creaking. Bear in mind I said these issues needing looking at weeks in advance.

I was then told I would have to come back and they would ring back to arrange another appointment. After a week later I had to chase them up to arrange a new appointment. I was told it wouldn’t be for at least another month. I also told them my car had developed a diesel emission fluid fault since the service. I was told I would have to go through Landrover Assist. No interest by them to fix. Clearly a fob off.

Inchcape actually called a day before the second appointment and cancelled it due to no curtesy car available. I had to again go without air conditioning for another week in sweltering 32 degrees C heat. I again also told them my car had developed the diesel emission fluid fault which Landrover Assist fixed (and advised me to inform Inchcape as part of the schedule of works as they would need to allot more time to look at the def injector).

3rd time I arrived for my appointment and the Inchcape representative again said no car available. Even though I was promised profusely the previous week. Their only offer was to take me to work and pick me up. As I run a business I have many appointments which I need to get to by car. This is not acceptable to me. Hence the curtesy car requirement. When I got to Inchcape Preston the diesel emission fluid fault wasn’t recorded and I had to go through the performance yet again explaining it. They eventually sorted a curtesy car but asked for driving licence which I had already given previously when they messed up on the first visit. No one said I would need to give it again. I was then refused the car as I had no driving licence. Not even an offer to sort something out and even though they earlier offered to take me to work.

I asked to speak to the manager. I was refused. Their representative said they couldn’t insure me so I couldnt have a curtesy car so there was no point me speaking to their manager. Clearly another fob off.

As time was passing (over an hour) and I had business appointments to attend to I had to leave with no resolution only a word that they would call me in due course.

As a result I have now put a complaint in to Land Rover HQ.

Time wasted on 2 separate occasions for the same problem due to their incompetance, having to empty my car for no reason and a wasted journey to Preston to be told they can’t help me. Complete waste of my time and money and no apology.

I thought I was buying into a premium car when I bought a Landrover for a premium price so I expected a premium service. I would get a better service with a Ford or Skoda Agent than this.

Clearly they have nice shiny buildings at Inchcape UK but their customer service is terrible. Beyond reproach.

I cant wait for the warranty to run out so I can actually take it to a local garage that does care.

Land Rover are great cars but are seriously let down by poor companies representing them like this."
7/6/18,5,"Helpful, friendly service"
7/6/18,5,"I returned to Coopers at Preston Park for my new BMW.
We were treated with the most professional and friendly input for our many questions regarding this purchase.
Amendments and additional input that I asked for to the car were carried out speedily and efficiently.
All the staff were helpful to us. I could have bought this same car at York but I choose my reliable local garage.
The salesman Johnathan Aihey was really patient and helpful with us.
Thank you."
7/6/18,5,"Excellent service, very thorough, less time than the 3hours expected. loved the video walk round and given a very good wash and vacuum to finish. Quality service from a quality company."
7/6/18,5,Service carried out within the time and price stated.
7/6/18,1,"An absolute shambles!! After putting my car in last Tuesday for a SIM card issue I was told at the end of the day that the car had to have a software update. I left it for a couple of extra days and had to chase up progress to which I was told that it was a wiring issue (which I didn’t believe) and that the car wouldn’t be ready until the Friday!! 4 times I had to call for an update and none came, in the end I went into the dealership and Lee the service guy bare face lied to me saying they were still having wiring problems. When I told him I didn’t believe him I spoke to Dave Grieve the service manager who investigated and, guess what? No wiring issue and no work been done - I had been lied too. Dave calmed me down and assured me he would deal with it and call me later today, guess what? NO CALL (despite me chasing him up)

DO NOT USE"
7/6/18,1,"Very bad service fitting a Mercedes Me Adapter. Expected time was 1hr, actual time taken was 1:45. Even then this item was not correctly fitted (the velcro fastening for the cover was left in the box).
The adapter was not commissioned correctly (or at all!), which eventually required me to call the MB contact help des, to get it activated on the MB system, (until then the App kept asking me to visit a service centre for it to be fitted)... & then give me instructions to activate the adapter on the vehicle (which had to be completed within 3 minutes of the website activation). The whole process took another frustrating 2 hrs for me to sort out at home...
POOR work Mercedes."
7/6/18,2,Did not troubleshoot a problem with a door speaker on my F-Type other than to tell me that couldn't find anything wrong when the car was already on the way back to me. They have asked me to tell them which radio station I was listening to and bring the car back in sometime - thanks!
7/6/18,4,"Had my car serviced by this garage & had no problems with the way I was treat or how the car was serviced. Only gripe was that they gave me the wrong service information when I collected my car, info was for another car. Nice loan car obtained for the duration of the service"
7/6/18,5,Mercedes Benz Southport have for the last 10 years maintained my Mercedes C160 in suberb condition. Have always found the whole servicing or MOT process painless with excellent service throughout. Would. recommend to anyone the purchase of a servicing contract to balance out service costs throughout the year - even for an older vehicle. At no time have I ever felt unnecessary works have been suggested or done. Costs have been very fair considering their expertise as a main dealer. The latest video safety check is an additional bonus.
7/6/18,5,"Great communication both prior to, during and post the service and MOT. The booking process was easy and I was kept up to speed on progress and completion of the works."
7/6/18,5,"Took my car in for a service and was looked after admirably by Diane.
Always a great customer experience at Mini Cooper Croydon and this occasion was no exception."
7/6/18,5,"Recently purchased an approved used F Pace. Purchase was not planned and so the garage did well to accommodate my requirements to prepare the vehicle for sale subject to my test drive. Also to value my p/ex. Overall a very good experience, friendly and knowledgeable staff, who made us feel very welcome on the day (we travelled across from our holiday location in the North West). Would recommend."
7/6/18,1,"I booked to drop the car off and inconvenience my partner to pick me up, so I didn't need to sit in the salesroom; drop off and go. I was asked to wait for 25 mins before someone was free to take a my keys, get one signature and walk me to my car and back just to get the mileage. Annoyed because my kids had to wait in a hot car.

The cost was crazy for what you got. When returned the windows didn't turn in, the person didn't know how to fix that. I fiddled and got it working again. The screen has since (it went in 6 days ago) been a little flickery at times, I'm dreading having to take it in again now.

Car wheels (behind alloys) and inside still dirty after offering to clean the car.

Overall, I feel I've been fleeced. I'm not allowed to use anyone else and as a captive customer, they don't need to try as hard."
7/6/18,5,"I had my BMW serviced at Cooper Chelmsford on Thursday. Everything very efficiently done from booking in to completion of work. Staff every helpful. Attention drawn to a bulge in the sidewall of front tyre which I had not noticed.
Only adverse comment that I would make is that I was quoted £209.40 for a new tyre (which was not in stock), whereas I was able to get the exact same tyre bought and fitted at Nick's Tyres in nearby Boreham for £180."
7/6/18,1,"Stressful Experience

I bought new toyota C-RH Dynamic hybrid from Oxford.
I live in Coventry but still went with dealer in Oxford as they promised me the the car on next weekend. Sales agent ask me to pay the deposit on 16/06/2018 if I wish to have car by 23-24 June. So I paid £500 on phone and then all this started because I still haven't received my car and using courtesy Car. I was told my car will be deliver on 23-24 June. Then I get a call saying the car got sports pack and I have to pay £425 (50% of the pack) on top. I refused to pay for something that I didnt want so they asked me to wait till end Of June. So I negotiated with them as I had cheaper deal if I wanted to wait till end of month, also I have been told that they are giving me gap insurance for free + £1000 discount on top of my scrappage. but to my surprise when I received order form only £500 was discounted and rest £500 was used to give me ""free"" Insurance.
then near to delivery date I got call saying they cant deliver me car but they will give me courtsey car and I have to come to branch for paying the rest of the deposit and sign the paper work as Scrappage deal is finishing on 30/06/2018. on our arrival the sales person kept avoiding us. us and keep sending his colleagues to do our paper work (who`s expertise was dealing in used cars but not new) so he couldn't answer our questions. No car payment was taken even after my wife them to take payment. I could have got my car on Thursday (05/07/2018) but due to pending payment we couldnt.
at one stage, every time I saw dealer`s number flashing on my mobile first thing came to my mind was ""now what"".
I thought buying your first new car would be a pleasant and exciting experience but unfortunately I was disappointed.

Rushed Sale
huge gap between promises and delivery
Lots of goof ups
Poor Communication
Inefficient sales process
misleading and mis-selling
Please do your own research about prices and other products before buying car from here"
7/6/18,5,Excellent service. Only slight criticism is that some of the promised communication did not arrive until after I collected the car. Otherwise first rate.
7/6/18,1,"I booked my car in a few weeks ago & arranged to have a hire car. I booked a day off work so I could take the car in. The night before I was told no hire cars were available. After some negotiation I arranged for them to pick the car up. Thus I had no car and had to change my plans for my day off. In the evening they phoned to ask if they could deliver the car back the next day. Again after a negotiation I got the car back early evening.
Very poor service. Particularly v disappointing as I had , had to wait so long for the appointment. Not impressed."
7/6/18,5,"Very helpful, they gave me a good deal ! Actually the were pretty Amazing I would recommend them all day long"
7/6/18,3,"Communication - simple. It would have earned you a 5.

Advised collection 8-10am.
10:30 still no one came so I called
Advised I would be called back - wasn’t
12:30 I called again was told on way
12:40 they arrived

Actual service was for air con and to turn off the service light which wasn’t reset after the last service.

Sorry Audi."
7/6/18,5,"Very good customer service, booked car in for MOT and went for a walk and car was ready in 2 hours all cleaned and health check carried out for free."
7/6/18,5,"No Hassle in booking the appointment, picked up on time and dropped off as required. The only issue was I instructed for no additional work to be completed unless spoken to first, AddBlue was added to the service and I was expected to pay for it again, this is the 2nd time it has happened"
7/6/18,5,"All of the staff were very helpful and explained everything well. The service provided was cost effective and delivered exactly on the time they said. Nice touch as well with the video report during the MOT. Exceeded expectations, as they also managed to fit in a parts recall / upgrade and give the car a good clean at the same time."
7/6/18,4,"Was expected, staff courteous and efficient and great coffee!"
7/6/18,1,"I've just had a read through some of the reviews below and it's like deja vu for me. There seems to be a culture of poor customer service at BMW. Nice cars once you get them, but hope that nothing goes wrong. I phoned on 11th June to book my car in for diagnostics because of some issues with the aircon and boot. I was given a date of July 4th, which I humbly accepted, as I had no other choice (Please bear in mind the car is less than a year old). I was then phoned and told the day before the appointment that the courtesy car I was promised had been written off (sound familiar?) so they would need to pick me up and drop me off, or reschedule (with another three week wait for an appointment!). My husband said we weren't happy with that (I had a job interview on July 4th and needed a car) and to come back to us with a better solution. To date have not heard back despite phoning back twice, and being told that a manager would phone me back on the same day. I am currently on hold to their customer complaints line - it has been 45 minutes and counting. I sent an email as well, but really don't expect any response based on what I've read here. I guess they are good cars - as long as nothing goes wrong with them.....good luck everyone.....and yes, we should have bought the Nissan.....will do so when the contract on the BMW expires"
7/6/18,5,"Very impressed with how we were dealt with from initial deal to delivery.
Thanks especially to Kevin our salesman on this deal and thanks in general to all who made the purchase of this car go so seamlessly.
I love my new Jaguar F Pace Portfolio.

Amanda Hague"
7/6/18,5,"I was looking to opt out of company car scheme and arrange my own PCH.

Jaguar was one of the manufacturers that appealed to me so i arranged an appointment at my local dealership in Southampton.

I was expecting this to be a stressful experience. Thanks to the assistance, knowledge and experience of this team, the whole process of arranging a PCH couldn't have been any easier. Models and price structures were clearly explained, test drives arranged etc..

I would certainly recommend this company"
7/6/18,5,"As always, staff and service carried out to a high level."
7/6/18,5,Very good service & extremely helpful people. Would recommend Cooper reading to anybody thinking of buying a Mini or BMW.
7/5/18,3,No courtesy cars at all! Was stuck without one
7/5/18,5,Real Professionals. the car was perfect
7/5/18,3,"My car was booked in for a recall and I had a text to confirm. However, when I got there I was informed that only half the job could be done owing to a shortage of parts. I will need to return the car probably in September.
My travelling time is around an hour, the appointment was 9am and the car wasn't ready for collection until 4pm. A courtesy car wasn't available.
The car received a health check and had been valeted. However, just before driving off I discovered the 'i' from the '318' on the rear of the car had been knocked off but no one cared to mention it until I returned to Reception. I was told they would post me a replacement and it is very easy to stick back on.
These things can happen but I expect a higher standard from BMW. The valeting wasn't particularly impressive but an improvement on how it looked before.
A little disappointing overall if I'm honest"
7/5/18,1,"Woefully poor customer service on a consistent basis at Cooper Thames Ditton. They rarely answer the phone, do not return calls and do not do as they promise."
7/5/18,5,Excellent service and good communication throughout
7/5/18,5,"Prompt easy drop off for my service, phone call from mechanic to say that all was well. Pick up quick and easy. Staff very polite and friendly. Overall excellent"
7/5/18,1,"From bitter personal experience I would advise you to boycott Mercedes dealership in North Oxford , in fact I would also advise boycotting the Inchcape company itself. This will save you the torment of attempting to force this dealership to honour their sales agreements and promises. Do not get blinded by the brand name into thinking you are paying a premium price for a quality product and service, as you will be paying a premium for, poor service, poor quality work and the embarrassment of listening to blatant lying .
If you question what I am saying, then telephone North Oxford dealership's reception, service or parts department and see how long it takes someone to answer the phone. This issue gets frustrating when you have a concern with the vehicle you have purchased. The quickest department to answer the phone will be the sales department of course and that is where your problem will start.
Finally, in regard to the empty rhetoric concerning their usually exemplary, imagined and sadly non existent customer service, which is usually appears below missives such as these imploring the writer to contact Inchcape.; be advised that Inchacape contacted me four weeks ago and tape recorded my discussions surrounding the issues I am having with their North Oxford dealership. I was assured that the recording would be presented to their managers and someone would respond to my complaints. Three weeks has past and no one has contacted me. This comes as no surprise and merely confirms my conviction that buying a car from them was a very very grave error on my part.

It is said that “A fool and their money are soon parted “ so if you do proceed to deal with these people then do not say afterwards that you were not warned!

This company tell lies to its customers, the quality of its work is poor if in fact the work is performed at all.

It's your choice but after you have parted with your money and you have problems with your purchase you will find no one wants to speak with you, neither the dealer nor parent company , don't say you were not warned.


Finally a note to Inchcape, before you respond to this missive with the usual empty rhetorical concern when imploring me to contact you, be advised ; I have already discussed many issues when you telephoned me four weeks ago with regard to my experience when purchasing a car in North Oxford. You recorded about 15 mins conversation when I explained the problems I experience. I was assured that your managers would be given the recording and that they would respond, that was four weeks ago. I have heard nothing since.

Further, attempting to contact you is a waste of time as the telephone numbers given on your websites namely +442075460022 and 00800 9777 7777 are out of service. You really do not want to hear any complaints do you??"
7/5/18,5,very happy with everything
7/5/18,4,My company car has not been running well for sometime. I could not get a date with Coopers for about a month. Before this date the car became worse (Warning light showing) and I took it back into them as I did not feel very safe in it. I was told that although the car needed attention it was safe to drive. I drove it back to work and called out BMW help/support. They came very quickly and changed a valve that was connected in some way to a problem with emissions. I then needed to have a software update but waited for another 10 days. Once at Coopers the service was good and the car was returned to me nice and clean inside and out. Just not sure about some of the advice I had and the length of time it took to sort the car out.
7/5/18,5,Brilliant service from salespeople you can trust.
7/5/18,5,Excellent service and facilities
7/5/18,5,Always a friendly greeting and helpful staff. Always treated with respect and made to feel special. Never had a complaint about Inchcape UK...I'm driving my third car from them.
7/5/18,5,Excellent service from Mercedes-Benz of Leicester. Booked service online. Reminder and confirmation a day before. As promised took 90 min to complete. Waited in comfortable lounge which provided hot and cold drinks with news paper and magazines. Car nicely cleaned inside and out. Price as expected from a reputable garage.
7/5/18,4,"I would like to give 5 stars to Diane, but 2.5 stars to who ever decided that Diane could do the job of 3 people! Sales people do make big sales, but, excellent service keeps the customers coming back.
Get Diane an assistant!!
Otherwise 👍"
7/5/18,5,Great service - very helpful people.
7/4/18,5,Really pleased with level of service from Coopers. Car was beautifully prepared for us.
7/4/18,3,Had a few issues with dealership in terms of getting my car when promised. Also slow to respond to email enquiries. However did sort things out in the end. Just a little frustrating. On a positive note they were very competitive with pricing especially when comparing this to other local dealerships in the Northeast.
7/4/18,4,"Once contact was made with a person they proved very helpful and well informed about the vehicles.
However, considering I was in the process of buying a new car I found phoning in to check any progress was a little frustrating. Even though I thought I had made the right option choices the phone often just rang and rang. I found the best way of speaking with someone was to ask for reception.
I have only just taken delivery and I'm pleased that there are no negatives to report - both my wife and I are pleased with the car."
7/4/18,3,"Had car serviced here. Work was great. Reasonable price too. But poor communication takes the shine off their work. Staff were less than polite when I went to drop the car off at the agreed time (6:30 - 7:00 pm). And next day, no communication on when car was ready to be picked up. I had to call the reception at least 5 times (between 4:30 and 5:30 pm) before they picked up the phone, so I could know that the car was ready."
7/4/18,4,"Good service and helpful staff. If anyone is looking to buy a Mercedes, then this is definitely the place to come!"
7/4/18,5,All ways get good service
7/4/18,5,Excellent service.
7/4/18,5,"I went to Hyde Audi on a Saturday afternoon to look at cars / see if I could test drive one. Ended up buying an A1, and brought it home yesterday (Tuesday) - can't fault the service received by Hyde Audi. Everything was explained well to me when I collected the car, and I was more than happy with it.
Gary (who dealt with everything for me) was excellent! :-)"
7/4/18,5,"A great improvement at this dealership since a staff change.
However an improvement in customer parking is desperately needed at this dealership. Our car which was damaged whilst parked was repaired without question, but the parking is very congested and is in urgent need of improvement"
7/4/18,3,"Not a great experience. Expect better from BMW. Not kept in contact regarding vehicle service and pick up time. Keep waiting right until the very end of the day. Most disappointingly, car not valeted after service."
7/4/18,5,Really excellent service.
7/4/18,5,"We chose to take our car for servicing at Cooper Norwich after having a poor experience at Listers Bmw Kings Lynn. The whole experience was excellent, from the booking to the service. We had a 'while you wait appointment, took about 1.5 hours. Had coffee provided while we waited. All the staff are friendly and attentive. We had a chat with the service manager Mark Small about an unrelated problem we have with the car which Listers were reluctant to assist us with and he could not have been more helpful. We are not expecting a positive result from Bmw Uk with that issue but at least we felt that we were listened to and Mark made some enquiries into it with Bmw Uk.
In all a very positive experience and we would recommend Cooper Norwich to anyone."
7/3/18,2,"No one really looks after you here. I have lease car with them, need to get a new car soon, asked to meet with the sales person who I test drove with, never followed up with me. Dont think they care about the keeping their custom.
Everytime I get a service and my car washed, they do a poor job of even cleaning the car. Very disappointing. and as a customer of 3 years I feel very undervalued and not looked after at all."
7/3/18,5,everything done to high standard and in one day..
7/3/18,1,"20/8/18
Update
Emailed to contact Inchcape on their email address, no reply to our email that I hey requested .

Friendly enough but didn’t listen to our needs .
Said would have no problem selling our diesel car on for court as emaculate, then came back with low offered .
When asked why said it was because of diesel issues at present !
So when asked if new desiel showed this in the reflection of the price on sale, they contradicted themselves by saying selling at full price desiel on forecourt ....
What a shame we have number of minis in house hold but sadly considering looking else were ....
On the other hand 5 stars to the customer service , service engineers and lads who wash/valet the cars after service at BMW , always customer orintated .

31/7/18
Due circumstances beyond our control delay in Emailing company . Have taken up their invation to discuss matters awaiting reply from them on my email ......."
7/3/18,4,Service was good had a very good courtesy car !
7/3/18,5,"In for a service, no problem with the drop off, and picked up a little 3i for the day, strange little car but great to drive, early pick up of my car and again very smooth and quick, without any hiccups, well done"
7/3/18,5,Car picked up and retuned all in good time.kept up to date about service via phone and video link.washed and cleaned to.
7/3/18,5,5* all round.
7/3/18,5,"I was very impressed with honesty displayed by the salesman and the efficiency of the sale process.

I would recommend in the future."
7/3/18,5,Great experience from start to finish. Owen and Carl were amazing throughout and I love my new car!
7/3/18,1,"I have two BMWs and have used Cooper Reading because they were my closest dealer. I had a problem with the paint on one brand new car. It took them over 3 months to sort it out and the service manager never returned any calls I made. I even made an official complaint about how lousy the service was, but that never came to anything and was never followed up.

Since then I have had other dealing with them and they consistently never return calls. I will probably look to Marshall Hampshire going forward. It's further away, but the service couldn't be any worse than Cooper Reading."
7/3/18,2,"And not the first time with Inchcape. Had my original appointment for service and MOT cancelled with only 24 hours notice because they have this new state of the art premises, shame it didn't have MOT certification. Appointment was re-booked for a few weeks later when I could have a courtesy car because I was told I couldn't sit and wait because they didn't know how long it would take as they were using another garage for the MOT. OK so far if a tad inconvenient. Travel time was 44 minutes using the address and post code on their website, wrong postcode on the site, ended up in some awful place between Nuneaton and Coventry before I could pull over to phone to ask for directions. All their agents were busy, took ten minutes to answer before I could get the correct post code. The place is close to the Ricoh arena off a dual carriageway, appallingly difficult to access and even worse to leave. Try getting ono that dual carriageway at rush hour!
Lesson number 1, when you book get the correct postcode otherwise like me you'll end up somewhere you really don't want to get out of your car.
Lesson 2, if your car needs an MOT check if they can do it on site, whether they have got their certification finally, if not book somewhere else and cut out the middle man, it'll save you time and stress.
When I finally arrived there and sat waiting to be served the person who was supposed to deal with me didn't even have my name correctly written down. So they have four years at least of details on their computer of servicing, MOT, payments etc but someone couldn't be bothered to transpose that correctly on the worksheet.
Lesson number 4, there's very little going on regarding care and attention of the customers and those little things that make you feel like they care about you as a customer. Get used to it, it's just the way it is and if you have a specialist car that requires a main dealer this is it or the option I considered during this meltdown was to return to my old dealership in Worcester. It's a drive of an hour and a quarter but hey, it took me that long to find the place anyway and it's a much nicer environment over there. And it's not just the biscuits and muffins with the coffee calling me, it's the fact that they never made me feel like a second class citizen because I happen to enjoy driving a Smart car not a top of the range Mercedes Benz."
7/3/18,4,Good service. I purchased a 220d E class cabriolet on 23rd June 18. The sales lady Miss Barbosa was a delight to deal with and certainly knew her product. I would recommend the company and will probably deal with them again in the future.
7/3/18,5,"Friendly staff, very helpful and professional...!!"
7/3/18,4,Work undertaken in timely manner. Only downside was the car wasn't valeted during the process
7/3/18,2,"Their new facility in Coventry is great, but that's let down by the attitude of office staff. Went into get my car serviced the other day, the white collar staff were really arrogant, the only exception was the receptionist and the gentleman mechanic who helped me to navigate my car out of the bay."
7/3/18,2,"I called reception 4 times spoke with different people they did get back to me until 1 hour later very unprofessional particularly Receptionest called Venessa !!
1 hour later service man called Phil got back to me saying my Q7 is ready to b collected
I used Manchester garage they were faster in their response"
7/3/18,5,"Just taken delivery of my GLC 43 AMG!!!

I cannot thank Mark Shakeshaft enough for his perseverance in sourcing me exactly what I wanted. He did all the hard work and I drove away in a gleaming new vehicle. Mark kept me updated throughout the whole process and the handover (including the car being unveiled from underneath a huge Mercedes cover) was effortless.

Thanks again to Mark for all your efforts and also to Ian MacDonald for his help and guidance in terms of insurance products.

Overall, highly recommended."
7/3/18,4,"I had the annual service of my BMW M3 carried out at Cooper Tunbridge Wells. I cannot fault the level of service I received from checking in the car in the morning to collecting in the evening. The staff were friendly and helpful and my one additional request was dealt with. They kept me informed as they said they would.

The only reasons I am not giving five stars are:-

1. the loan car was so low on petrol I barely made it to the fuel station by the time I noticed.
2. I was asked if I wanted the car washed. It was but the windows were left in a worse state than when I brought the car in. Not really good enough."
7/3/18,5,"Efficient kept to times explained process even sorted out recall issue saving another visit
Great idea of vehicle being videotaped"
7/3/18,4,"Good , fast and efficient service"
7/3/18,5,Excellent service and done with a smile which is always nice
7/3/18,5,"Excellent service, very helpful staff, good communication."
7/2/18,4,Really enjouyed talking and working with Steve to secure my gorgeous new mini . He was quick to respond and sent the extra mile in making sure details were actioned
7/2/18,3,"Brought an Audi Q3 from East Kent Audi Canterbury on Thursday 28/06/2018 happy with the car and service I received. But it would been nice to be told that the car only had 10 miles of fuel left to empty with the Adblue warning light on, Not being familiar with the area we had to ring the dealership to find directions to the nearest garage .I would have gladly have paid money in advance for the fuel and the Adblue If is the way they run there business, Rather of having a stressful half hour trying to find a garage on what should have been an enjoyable day"
7/2/18,1,"I would not recommend Mercedes Benz of Nottingham dealership at all, the aftersales service is terrible! I usually don’t leave reviews but having received consistently poor customer service I have no choice. I asked for my GAP insurance to be cancelled and after numerous emails and phone calls the insrance is still not cancelled. I am most upset by the fact that I have not received a single response to any of my emails to the business manager and that is not acceptable at all. The sales person did respond to some of my emails so Mercedes can’t say they never received my emails. Secondly, I reported some issues with the car that the dealership promised to resolve but they didn’t in the allocated 3 days and said they will email me with a company’s details who will come round to my place to do the work but I never received that email. I repeatedly tried to contact the dealership but I was given the same response that someone will be in touch but I didn’t get a response again for weeks. I have since raised a formal complaint and The issues still remain unresolved 2+ weeks following my complaint. This has been my second car from Mercedes and I think will probably be the last Mercedes vehicle. It’s a pity I do love the brand but the service is letting the brand down."
7/2/18,5,"Every Swindon Audi visit is a hassle free experiance, walking in the door to the lovely new wide open interior is like walking into a car show.
When dealing with the staff I find them helpful, knowledgeable and very accomadating with all requests, I would like to name people that I have had dealings with (denise) but I won’t take the shine off of those not spoken too :)
All in all a great experiance and a fantastic team, you won’t be disappointed when visiting for what ever reason you may have.
Good Luck Swindon Audi."
7/2/18,2,"Normally an excellent service from Swindon Audi but not this time.
Car was booked in for a service and on a recall for an oil switch, car also needed front speaker looking at as it was giving a distorted sound and the rear number plate had come away from it’s mounting on the right side.
Dropped car off as requested at 08.45 and said I’d collect before close of business which is 19.00.
Received phone call about 17.00 saying car was ready and went over what had been done.
Car needed new osf tyre and new wiper blades and a shock absorber was leaking but lease company (lex auto lease) wouldn’t authorise a repair I’m used to that our company have been using them for years and they are worse than awful if you need anything doing.
Went to collect the car only to be told they didn’t have the oil switch in stock so couldn’t do the recall fit, if you don’t have the part in stock at time of booking the car in then don’t book it in, but they did the oil change etc and informed me they had repaired the number plate, they couldn’t find fault with the speaker.
Next morning I load my boot ready for work close the boot and the number plate falls off on the right side, start the car only to be greeted by what sounds like my sat nav lady in a fish bowl while gargling the water, same with the radio or any media I choose to play also the technicians phone was linked to my car, why? I do around 1200 -1400 miles a week so having to return the car again and losing a days work doesn’t sit well.
I have to choose my new car soon so will live with the speaker issue and repair the number plate myself.
Will my next car be an Audi? Maybe not."
7/2/18,5,"We were originally told the car we wanted was sold, but as soon as the sale fell through, we were called back and given all the information we needed by a consultant Grant Pilling. He thoroughly explained all the options and the finer details about the car. The customer service we received when travelling all the way to Warrington from London was second to none. Grant was very accommodating to all our needs and consequently purchasing a Mercedes from the dealers is something I would absolutely always recommend my friends and family consider. Thank you Mercedes!"
7/2/18,5,As I say 5 stars
7/2/18,1,"I had to argue to get the recal work done on the day it was booked in for especially as I left it with them all day. They also offered a wash and it was very poorly done, they didn’t even dust the dashboard."
7/2/18,5,Excellent professional friendly service from Stacy. Faultless Thank you
7/2/18,5,"Excellent customer service. Friendly, professional and very helpful."
7/2/18,5,"Hi,
Went to Mini Cooper Ipswich to buy a MINI Clubman Cooper Sport.
Met James. Fine and knowledgeable young man about the MINI brand and what Cooper Ipswich had to offer. Met other members of the Mini team including receptionists and all friendly and welcoming. James identified a Cooper Sport in stock with a good specification. James is well informed and answered all my questions as to the car and the specifications. I had a strict budget to stick to. After initial discussions on the price of the Cooper S James quickly realized I was a committed buyer at the right price for me. The purchase was then made. Fantastic. James was away on delivery day however Niall and Adam stepped in for a fluid handover. No pressure from add on sales but informed on products available to future proof your car. Fantastic. MINI have upped their game .The car feels and performs like a premium estate. Whats not to like.."
7/2/18,5,"happy and friendly staff
No pushy sales
Very helpful and found us the car we wanted for the budget we gave.
Highly recommended 😁"
7/2/18,5,"Quite simply the whole team does exactly what is says it will do from purchase through preparation,adminisration, delivery and aftersales!"
7/2/18,1,I would give it zero if Trustpilot allowed. Shameful company. Dreadful product knowledge and sales staff would say anything to get the order. Dont return calls. Integrity of staff zero. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
7/2/18,5,"I was assisted by Gary Martin and James Smith with my purchase and I could not recommend them more.
They are extremely knowledgeable and able to assist and advise you through the whole process.
Thank you"
7/2/18,5,Professional service and advice.
7/2/18,5,Had towbar and roof rails fitted. Staff very helpful - fitted my bike rack foot to fixed flange towbar at same time and updated software. Car washed and hoovered too.
7/2/18,5,Darren at Audi Maidstone was great. Loving our new car!
7/2/18,4,"Very good service, both salesman seen were very thorough and patient."
7/2/18,5,"Samantha was extremely helpful. She knew exactly what I wanted. It was was done ever so quickly, she made experience simple and easy.
I will look forward to to my next car with the Audi team."
7/2/18,5,"I was very impressed by the staff throughout my experience, they were polite, provided the right information and were able to generate rapport. My only issue was not with the staff or anyone at Cooper, Reading, but the Apple Maps which directed me to the other side of the building which meant i couldn't drive in.....user error perhaps...?"
7/2/18,5,"I like this dealer! I enjoyed browsing the wide selection of vehicles without feeling pressured. I was able to do this at my leisure and staff were on hand to answer my questions. On making a decision to buy, the whole process was smooth and seamless. Karen, who dealt with my purchase, knew every step which made it relaxed and stress free! On collection I was shown all the features and again, nothing was too much trouble. I have bought cars from other establishments in the past and can honestly say that this has been a great experience.
I have a fabulous car from a sales team I trust.
Thankyou!"
7/2/18,5,"Great service, no problems and courtesy car provided."
7/2/18,1,"Another shocking performance from Inchape Hunters Land Rover. It’s annual service time and Hunters pestered to have me book my one year old vehicle booked in for service.

However I’ve decided to sell so called Hunters on four separate occasions to talk to someone to see if they maybe interested in buying the car back for their used stock. Each time I’ve been told I need to speak with their sales Manager ‘Paul’, still has no return call from anyone.

A truly awful experience from Hunters, who in my opinion don’t deserve to be in business and actually severely damage the Land Rover brand."
7/2/18,5,Very efficient and courteous staff. I would recommend Inchcape strongly.
7/2/18,5,"From the beginning to the end with a purchase the whole customer journey was relaxing informative and enjoyable

We both felt at ease and treated respectfully and with honesty with humour.

Your Sales Representative projected professionalism and humour. Christine Drabble was perfect to keep us on our purchase journey and interacted at our level of what to buy.

A great experience and looking forward to purchasing another vehicle soon."
7/2/18,5,"Flawless customer service, from the day i made the first phone call untill the day i picked up the car i cannot complain, great experience and a big thank you to Michael Reed."
7/2/18,5,I collected my new Mercedes-Benz GLA on Saturday and could not recommend the dealership enough! Simon Morley in the new car sales team made it possible to order my dream car within budget and was always on hand to answer any of my questions. The hand over experience was fantastic and I drove away feeling happy that I knew all of the features on my car. Thanks Inchcape Mercedes-Benz of Oxford I will be back.
7/2/18,1,"Absolutely appalled, After Enquirering about Satnav upgrade and being told I’d have to wait 6wks to get an appointment if I wanted to wait with my car, which I was told would only take 1hr, I booked it in at a cost of £99 and being told this also would cover the 12mths membership fees!!
On arrival at this dealership at 1.40pm, which I was booked in from 2pm, I was then approached and advised that this upgrade and Mercedes me would take up to 4hrs, after a confused discussion with a adviser I was then left 20mins until I was then advised by the service manager it should only take 1hr but may run over???? Over 3hrs later I was still waiting, when I finally got away and home I then realised that they hadn’t even sorted out the Mercedes me, so I then had a 30min call with Mercedes to sort out myself and then was told I’d have to pay anoth £49 for live traffic services, I was then very confused as I was told and led to believe that the £99 I paid was for this service!!!!!
Obviously I complained and was told someone will call me back but I’m still waiting since Friday 29th June!!!!!
Whilst in the waiting room I overheard many discrulped customers complaining how bad the service was, coming from a customer facing business myself I found it absolutely disgusting and off putting, this dealership is the far worst I’ve ever had to deal with and unless I get some sort of an apology and full explanation as to why I was misled and the products not completed correctly in the 4hrs they had to do it then I’ll have to report them to trading standards and ombudsman."
7/2/18,5,"Great experience . Treated really couteously. Zena and Jodie were very well informed about Toyota cars and listened carefully to what we were looking for. This is our 4th car purchased from Inchcape. We are very happy with sales staff and aftercare from Service Department.
We cannot recommend Nottingham Toyota more highly"
7/2/18,5,Brilliant service
7/2/18,4,"Service was fine, but the cafe area was too busy / noisy"
7/2/18,2,"Not the dealership it once was, I bought a car that was in excess of 20k and was left to feel pretty low."
7/2/18,5,Excellent efficient honest service especially by Luca
7/2/18,5,"Excellent service by the salesman (Dave Flynn) and the receptionist. Choose Toyota (Aygo - 2015) after having being a Mercedes owner family for over 20 yrs.
Thank You.
Dillon."
7/2/18,1,"I purchased an A1 S-Line style edition, only to find out a day before delivery I would not be getting the wheels as advertised, and instead be downgraded to a lower spec equivalent, yet pay the original full price.
Despite the wheels going missing under the responsibility of inchcape and bound by a contract they are unwilling to replace or offer any kind of discount and expect the customer to bear the cost.
I wouldnt even expect these tricks from a dodgy car garage yet alone an Audi approved and authorised dealer.
Apparently management at Inchcape don't care about good customer service yet alone legal agreements for that matter."
7/2/18,5,"I found the sales team at Ipswich Mini especially, Adam Harrod, very friendly and welcoming with the purchase of my first mini."
7/2/18,5,"Louise was so friendly and made me feel happy, she kept in touch all the time, the car was completed before the time given and had a wash. Very good service"
7/1/18,1,"Audi Maidstone.
This garage appears to have no consideration for customers time. I arrived at 8.15 to drop the car and joined the queue to check it in, I finally left at 8.45am. This was an oil service which should not take long and needed the car for lunchtime, the paperwork clearly stated 12 noon but by 1.45 no news so I called and spoke with Ben (useless) and he said the car was ready. I arrived at 2pm and he said he would get t ready and then spent 15 mins on the phone, I challenged him and he said they were cleaning it and it would be 10 minutes- I didn't get it until 2.50pm.

However much worse than this. I CHECKED MY BILL AND THEY CHARGED ME FOR 11 LTRS OF ADBLUE, THIS CANNOT BE TRUE AS I FILLED IT 2 DAYS PRIOR WITH 10 LITRES, AGAIN I CHALLENGED AND HE SAID THE COMPUTER SAID IT NEEDED IT. THIS IS DISHONEST AT LEAST AND ILLEGAL AS THERE IS NO WAY THEY PUT THIS IN THE CAR. THE ATTITUDE IS APPALLING AND THERE WAS NO OFFER TO DELETE IT FROM THE INVOICE SO I WILL BE TAKING THIS FURTHER.
IF YOU ARE READING THIS I URGE YOU TO THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU USE THIS GARAGE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PROFIT IF THEY CHARGE YOU FOR ITEMS NOT SUPPLIED OVER A FULL YEAR. I WON'T BE USING THEM AGAIN AND INTEND TO ENSURE MY COMPLAINT IS ACTUALLY TAKEN SERIOUSLY- IT'S NOT THE MONEY IT'S JUST LIES AND THEFT."
7/1/18,1,Bought a car and two days later had to go back to be fixed. A week later the car broke down (Friday). Was advised that I did not have roadside assistance (comes with warranty) as my car was not registered. After a lot of wrangling BMW picked up the car dropped me home. Came and took the car away. Due to go back to dealer Monday. No courtesy car as promised as again not registered. No point having approved BMW benefits if you cant use them. Don't know how I will get to work on Monday. Happy to change review if things get sorted quickly. Been without a car for 2 days now.
7/1/18,5,Treat customers with respect and kindness
7/1/18,5,I was lent a car. Mine was serviced and cleaned and came back running very well. There was a video of the service and I was treated very well by the garage. Highly recommend them if you need a service.
6/30/18,5,Car collected from home for service and MOT. Returned afterwards after having been washed and vacuumed inside. Excellent service.
6/30/18,5,"10/10 brilliant service provide by Phil, and the reception staff, all ran very smooth."
6/30/18,3,"Excellent in respect of new sales including the sales consultant. all information was provided with on going updates. impressive hand over of the new car with all systems explained.
However the valeting could have been better with tree sap in evidence and black marks on the paintwork together with polish residue not cleaned off the paintwork.. Also a one inch scratch that went through the paintwork into the body below leaving a black scratch mark on the area in front of the bonnet and scratches on the chrome area under the front and rear door window on the drivers side.. Obviously Mercedes will rectify the faults and provide a courtesy car while the work is being carried out. However the precheck on the car should have identified the issues. Overall excluding these issues the purchase of the car was a pleasurable experience."
6/30/18,5,I found them helpful and everything ok
6/30/18,5,I had Alex Daniels at Banstead who helped my process of buying my new mini so easy! Defo would recommend to anyone ! Thank you Alex
6/30/18,5,"Excellent and friendly service, impressed by everyone I met."
6/30/18,2,"After sales service very poor. After waiting four weeks for my new V5C (log book) and not receiving anything, thought it was time to act. Got intouch with the DVLA, who said they nothing with my name on it waiting to be documented. Got intouch with Inchcape to find out that the documents had not been sent of. Something else they fail on, after trying to get in touch with there sales man during my time waiting for V5C. Which we thought we had struck up a reasonable relationship with, failed to get back in touch. Another tiny thing, after spending quite a considerable amount on a second hand car, they don’t even put new mats in. Which I was able to source, tailor made for £15. The sales manager was more interested in selling add on warranties than customer satisfaction. Don’t think I shall go back to Inchcape Shrewsbury."
6/29/18,2,"The reception staff are wonderful, unfortunately I cannot say the same about the service representative. From the initial meeting with him at 8.20 am it was obvious he doesn’t enjoy his job, and is not in the slightest interested in customer care. I called him 3 times during the day for an update, (as I really did need the car back ASAP) he refused to speak to me or to return my call, so I wasted a complete day waiting around for a call back. I eventually got through to Sylvia (what a professional lady)and explainled my predicament to her, in that he was not returning my calls, and she went and found out that yes the car was ready for collection. Also I had booked the appointment 4 weeks in advance so as to have a courtesy car, only to receive a text message at 20.58 the night before, advising that a car would not be available and to call them now, I did but the phones are unmanned from 18.00 so why send the message. On the day of the service they did provide a mini cab home for me and promised another to return back to collect he car, but they didn’t advise me that the car was ready until it was too late to arrange the return journey, so I was another £20 out of pocket. Would I recommend the service side of Cooper Thames Ditton to friends, absolutely not. I bought my car there but will not be returning for the next service, and to that matter, when it comes to replacing it in the near future, I will be looking elsewhere, I have never had this problem with mercedes. Get the service staff to take customer care lessons from your wonderful reception girls, before they ruin the business."
6/29/18,5,Excellent service!
6/29/18,5,"On arriving at Inchcape Jaguar in York I was warmly welcomed by a member of staff.
Having travelled through lengthy congestion’s a journey Of 242.4 miles over 6 hours 😥I was Immediately offered a hot/cold beverage that arrived swiftly.
I wasn’t prepared for the lengthy journey and wasn’t intended to do it again. I wanted to drive away my new car that day.
At first I was told that the whole process would take a few days to have the car prepared and ready. My face must have said it all as Adam went to speak to his manager.
Everyone including the secretary whom I might add stayed on longer to help finalise the sale for me to drive away my new car that day.
I was bold over by everybody’s effort.
I’m now a proud owner of a jaguar xjl autobiography. A very big thank you to all at jaguar in York. Absolutely amazing to meet a friendly bunch of people.
I was given a chilled bottle of water for my journey home and I have to admit I had a tear of emotional kindness that I had received throughout my visit.
A credit to all at Inchcape Jaguar in York.
Thank you all so very much."
6/29/18,5,"Amazing new premises great set such an easy process for my service
Will definitely return"
6/29/18,5,"Fantastic service, couldn’t have left happier. I was so excited to be able to get my first BMW and Mia Robertson was outstanding!! She made the whole experience so enjoyable and confortable. I will definitely back for my next BMW at reading."
6/29/18,5,Great professional and friendly service from Becky. She had great product knowledge and was very genuine. Mini great too! 😎
6/29/18,5,"Perfect helpful service from Lee, with the purchase of my second mini at Coopers Norwich. As always all staff very helpful.. thank you"
6/29/18,3,"Car appears services and MOT ok but was returned in terrible state.supposed to be washed and cleaned but with large areas missed , only 3 wheels cleaned and very streaky. Had to get it washed on the way home very embarrassing."
6/29/18,2,Booked in for a service. I opted to wait for the work to be carried out. I was told it would take 90 minutes prior to choosing this option. I arrived at 8:30 and left at 11:30. That is 180 minutes. Very unreasonable for only a filter change.
6/29/18,5,"Fantastic service., great communication, couldn't ask for me. Highly recommended"
6/29/18,5,"Phil was really helpful and it was a pleasure being made to feel like a truly valued customer,
Really nice guy"
6/29/18,5,Excellent experience - really nice customer service from the whole team. Would definitely recommend as the job was done professionally and quickly. Thank you Swindon Audi :)
6/29/18,5,Superb service. So glad I have a Mercedes!
6/29/18,4,"Service very good from Simon Telford, although did seem very stretched due to staff shortages.
There are a couple of items outstanding , that is a parcel shelf missing and a drivers side matt. I am surprised they have been missed during pre delivery inspection.The true test will be when I receive them.That is being managed by Micheal Combe as Simon is on holiday."
6/29/18,5,"My first experience of Mercedes Loughborough and a very pleasant one. My car was booked in on a recall notice. The receptionists greeting was friendly and warm, she promptly left to inform Adam of my arrival who came and exchanged pleasantries. After the promised one hour, I returned to collect my freshly cleaned car which Adam brought to the door and bid me a good day. Perfect."
6/29/18,5,"Excellent service and very polite and helpful staff, very busy so expect a wait when taking your car in!
But the staff are all on hand to help out.

Thank you to Tom At Mercedes Nottingham for your help."
6/29/18,5,Everything was taken care of effortlessly without compromise ! A few concerns were dealt with professionally and to our liking . This is always the case there hence we return there each time for our new card!
6/29/18,5,Excellent service and professionalism especially from Issac.
6/29/18,3,"Fast and efficient service - I managed to get a cancellation spot so didn't have to wait 2 weeks for my A/C to be fixed during the hottest period on record !!
My only negative is the customer experience once you get to the service area - it really isn't clear what the set up is and you have to loiter until someone spots you as there is no dedicated service reception - there was no one around when I went to both drop my car off and pick it up so I ended up waiting around longer than I would have liked, eventually having to accost a random member of staff who happened to be walking passed - perhaps a little more thought needs to be applied to this area of what is otherwise a stunning new dealership."
6/29/18,4,"AS always, great service from Michael at Chelmsford. A shame that he and Laura had to man the service department on their own, which resulted in a late pick up through lack of communication, and the pair of them rushed of their feet. Management really need to look at this issue. Loan car was filthy, which is very unusual, which Michael was very apologetic about."
6/29/18,5,"I found the process of buying a used car at Cooper mini Banstead very easy and pretty straightforward. I knew what spec etc I was looking for and they did all the legwork of sourcing me a car which I found to be invaluable , as it’s very time consuming to keep looking around . Even though the car they found eventually fell through , they found me another one and I love it . I found the staff to be helpful and polite and not pushy at all . This is my first mini and I think I’m going to be a lifelong fan now !"
6/29/18,5,Efficient service and extremely helpful every step of the way.
6/29/18,2,"Booked my car in for the rear tracking and balance to be corrected (I was getting vibration through the steering) and to touch up a stone chip on my bonnet. I was told they would need the car for the day, so dropped it off at 9:30 as requested.
Upon arrival I was told that they no longer did paint work at Warrington.
If I had been told this when I booked it in, I would have gone elsewhere.
I returned at 3:30 to find that the car had not been touched at that point - having assumed that they needed the car all day for the paint to dry!
At 5:30 I was told that the car was almost ready and was on road test.
Unfortunately, the problem has not been corrected and the car is having to go back in.
I will update this review once the problem has been fixed."
6/28/18,5,"I've dealt with Cooper BMW Norwich in the past and have had very mixed experiences, some ok, some bad. This goes for other BMW dealerships as well, Soper Lincoln and Sycamore Peterborough to name 2 others.

It's been a few years since I last dealt with Cooper BMW Norwich and I am happy to say that now under new management since my last dealings the experience has been extremely good for the entire buying process from initial interest, to ordering, to purchase and collection.

The service has been prompt, informative at all stages of my purchase and the once arrogent attitude held by some of the staff seems to have been removed which only strengthens the dealership's customer service and its staff making them more approachable and comfortable to deal with.

Would happily recommend dealing with Cooper BMW Norwich."
6/28/18,5,"A very happy customer. Will Todd sold me my car. I purchased a Mini Cooper road star. Will was very informative and helpful. It was a stress free purchase. I only visited the Sunderland showroom to have a look but as soon as I saw my car I had to have it. Will did not pressurise me at all.

I highly recommend this show room to anyone considering purchasing a mini.

Thanks again will for your help.

From Angela"
6/28/18,5,"I definitely recommend Swindon Audi to everyone. This is the best car dealers to ever dealt with, Errald dealt with me professionally, he filled me with confidence in regards to my purchase. He his not a pushy sales gentleman, He knows his stuff and knowledge about anything to do with Audi. He was patient to wait for me for a whole week keeping the car I admire ready and waiting for me to test drive. There was no hesitation to buy the car, I bought the car straight away and he made all the paperwork life smooth and easy. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and extremely highly service from Erralld. This is the kind of staff any Audi dealer should keep, they add value to the company."
6/28/18,5,"Total hassle free experience where nothing is to much trouble
Well done Coopers"
6/28/18,1,"I've unfortunately had a frustrating experience with Cooper BMW Teesside and my BMW i8. It is a 2015 vehicle on a 5 year service pack. I had issues with the 12v battery around January 2018 and it failed again around April 2018. The car was collected and I was told the battery would be charged and car returned next day. I was then told I would have to pay £220 for a new battery as they had already replaced the battery in January, which was not consistent with what I had been told at that time. I called several times to ask if they could just explain what work they had done in January but I could never get through to anyone that could help, only being endlessly promised callbacks from Andrew which never happened. They offered a discount (down to £200) but I feel they had completely missed the point - I just wanted to know why they were charging me now for what they had allegedly done for free in January.

After 2 complaints to BMW UK, including emails to tellusmore (at) inchcape.co.uk, I got a brief email saying the battery had been replaced FOC - this had not addressed my complaint. They had my car for over 2 months (during which I spent £2000 on finance, plus car insurance and lost time on service pack and several other service charges that BMW charge for).

To add insult to injury, the car was filthy on return and clearly had been left parked under a tree for 2 months (so another £400 to spend at a detailer to clean off the tree sap) and the car started up with a red service light saying the car was overdue a service back in 03/2018 - they had not informed me of this and the work could have easily been done whilst they had my car for the 2 months (included under the service pack).

Of course, now I want to book the car in for service, and I get the same message that they're busy and I'll get a call back! Needless to say, the i8 is worthless if it spends most its life at BMW, so in the meantime I did what I should have done in the first place and bought a Nissan GTR.

What happened BMW, you used to be great??"
6/28/18,5,"First class service from start to finish from the York branch of MINI.
Adam Craven (sales) was exceptional in delivering a professional and efficient service, full of knowledge with no hesitation. Lucy in the office, again offering a first class service as with the ladies on reception.
Would recommend the York dealership to anyone looking for a Mini."
6/28/18,5,Friendly courteous and efficient service from test drive through to purchase of new vehicle.
6/28/18,5,"This is my second time in buying a used BMW and I have to say when I want to change my latest I would not hesitate to go back to Cooper BMW Chelmsford.

Many thanks to Henry for his understanding of customers who could not make up their minds on what car to buy. The Series 2 225d we decided on is perfect can't wait to get behind the wheel each day.

Many thanks for your help."
6/28/18,5,Absolutely amazing experience through this dealership when buying my car. Beyond helpful from my first phone call with Lee to after sales care. Truthful and honest as I was buying my car unseen meant a lot to me and nothing was too much trouble when explaining the finer details. I highly recommend this dealership and certainly rate it top notch. Thank you again Lee for all your help your customer service was above and beyond!
6/28/18,2,"Booked car in for recall informed it would only take 1 hour
I was on site for just over 2 hours
When I drove the car after work carried out the steering wheel was not put back on square
I had to re-book for this to be rectified
This is my first visit to this garage and first impressions are normally the ones you hold I am sorry to say not good"
6/28/18,4,"Would have been 5 but for rude attitude when ringing Inchape direct and lady on the phone telling me I missed a service when I knew I hadn't but she would not continue on the normal basis as I disagreed with her assessment. I rang the VW Serviceline, they totally agreed that I had not missed a service and then booked in with Inchape for me.
From this moment on, I cant fault Inchape, excellent fast drop off and not kept waiting on pick-up and staff on both occasions very knowledgeable and polite."
6/27/18,5,excellent service.lovely staff.lounge very nice.enjoyable from start to end.mike cox
6/27/18,5,Excellent service and great communication.
6/27/18,5,"The service on my car was carried very speedily and I was amazed how soon after dropping it off I was called back to pick it up. OK, it was only a Service A, i.e. an oil change and check-up, but it was still carried out quickly and more speedily than other makes of car I have owned. I was also really pleased how easy it was to book my car for a service on-line and all the available dates shown on my screen, far superior to phoning in and juggling available dates suitable for me and the garage."
6/27/18,4,Stacy Booth was extremely helpful. The only reason I have not given 5 stars is the fact that I was unable to collect my new car on a weekend.
6/27/18,5,Fantastic service at Stockport Audi. Excellent customer service. Very professional. Brilliant deal on a lovely nearly new Audi q2. Very happy 😊 would definitely recommend.
6/27/18,5,MOT was carried out without any issue and without delay.
6/27/18,5,"This was an excellent service. The staff were polite and efficient nothing was to much trouble. Taking my car for service here was almost
an enjoyable experience. Well done all at Stockport Inchcape and thank you .
I will certainly recommend
I have owned numerous cars over my 42 years of driving and this was the very best service that I have ever received"
6/27/18,5,Great Service
6/27/18,1,"BMW Sunderland
Not great I’m sorry to say. Staff were great and very friendly.
1 - Initial hour, charged at £99.00, only provided same information as I gave to BMW Service team myself when I left the car. Provided info as to what to look at next at extra cost. Nothing fixed.
2 - My car was also in for two recall items where the parts were not there for one so has to go back later.
3 - Inside if Car was immaculate when I left it and had debris from feet in foot wells when I picked it up. £3 missing from ashtray which had been left open by someone.
4 - Radio on very loud on station I don’t use and considerable petrol seems to have been used. It appears to me that the engine has been running while the work was done so someone could listen to the radio but this is my speculation.
5 - It is also my speculation that the recall work was done or partially done in the time I was paying for diagnostic/fault finding and repair work."
6/27/18,5,"Service was very good from start to finish, staff are very helpful at all timest"
6/27/18,5,"I contacted Inchape after seeing a ""Quality used"" vehicle online which I later bought based on a video of the vehicle and the salespersons guidance as I live some distance away. I found the information given by the salesperson was accurate resulting in a satisfactory purchase when the vehicle arrived. A huge thanks to Bart, the salesman for his help in my purchase. He answered any questions I had & assured me the quality of the vehicle was as it should be."
6/27/18,5,"Very pleasant garage to visit - staff know their jobs and are very friendly and polite.
Regular customers are greeted by name which tells you that the Cooper's staff welcome your visit."
6/27/18,5,Picked up my car for a B service. Very informative with video about my car. Dropped off my car like new.
6/27/18,5,"Super impressed with how professional the whole experience was. Janet was such a lovely lady did not feel pressured with the usual sales pitch. Look forward to returning to Audi in 2/3 years for an upgrade.
Thank you"
6/27/18,5,"Carried out fast and efficiently, good communication and service this time - Mark kept me informed.
Great improvement."
6/27/18,3,"Once again, good service from the dealer spoilt by poor back-up from BMW UK. I couldn't have wished for better service from the dealer - clean bill of health on MoT, car washed and looked good.Unfortunately they missed some corrosion spots on the bottom of the door - these were reported a day later, with photos sent to Head Office. Although the paint is still well within the long warrenty period, they claim it is damage due to stone chips so not warrented. There are many chips on the bonnet that have not corroded and I don't believe stones can chip this area. Anyway, what does paint warrenty mean if it can't deal with stone chips? Please remind me why the car cost £70k originally?"
6/27/18,5,Great service and very friendly
6/27/18,5,Everything ran smoothly and efficiently - very pleased.
6/27/18,1,Still waiting for my refund. I was told the money would be in my account yesterday 26/6 between 3pm and 6pm. Still no money. been put in. How can something so simple be so complicated. A quick fix that takes 2 months and counting to resolve. Great VW Customer service.
6/27/18,5,Richard was very polite and helpful.thanks
6/26/18,5,Very prompt service
6/26/18,5,"Very good experience, very professional/ knowledgeable but made to feel comfortable and no pressure. ( salesman Gary) Top fellow, had a bit of friendly banter whilst agreeing trade in value against the car I purchased ( c class amg line) The car was pristine in every way, and the price was very competitive with other cars out there ( auto trader) would certainly use again and recommend. ( travelled from sheffield to purchase) 👍👍"
6/26/18,5,"Bought a Mercedes C Class from the Nottingham Dealership, Jim Battrick from the sales team was very helpful and went out of his way to make sure we were happy about purchasing the car. Nathan was also very helpful explaining and sorting out the finance and warranty for the car. Great selection of Mercedes cars and very helpful staff, 10/10."
6/26/18,5,"My first experience of Lexus Derby was excellent !
6 months ago everything was arranged via email and the car was collected & returned by their drivers!
This is my second experience... again arranged via email but I dropped off and collected myself.
I’ve just returned from a 9 night cruise around the Med where I was treated like a king ... my short time at Lexus Derby was like I was David Beckham and George Clooney combined!
Thanks to Joanne Holly and Alex ... who should apply to channel 5 for his own late night chat show !!
Great team!"
6/26/18,5,"Once again, I am blown away by the experience from Southport Mercedes. Whether it is buying a car from them or servicing it with them it is the same, exceptional service from everyone there. Why go anywhere else? I live on the Isle of Man now and I still bring my car to Southport for a service"
6/26/18,5,Excellent service. Great staff.
6/26/18,1,"No friction, just didn’t do the job properly! Wasted my time."
6/26/18,5,Excellent service. Thank you.
6/26/18,5,I needed my BMW 435 serviced and I brought it into Thames Ditton. The team was polite and the service was impeccable. I defiantly will use them again.
6/26/18,5,"BMW Cooper Sunderland should be a flag ship for Inchcape UK. We would like to thank the following individuals there: Ellie Farrell, David McKechnie, Ray Haslam and last but not least Emma BMW Genius. Their skill and ability should make them irreplaceable they went through a complicated situation that resulted in my wife and I now enjoying our new BMW X5, a huge thank you to all involved."
6/26/18,2,"On site visit was good, but follow up needs improvement. After my visit some warning lights appeared and despite voice mails and emails , 3 days on no response received."
6/26/18,5,Excellent customer service and sales staff were very honest and helpful. San easy ride when you want to purchase a car which can generally be stressful but not so when you are dealing with INCHCAPE.
6/26/18,5,"Very efficient, knowledgeable and competent."
6/25/18,5,"All went according to plan...courtesy car supplied.... no issues
Attentive staff very happy"
6/25/18,5,Efficient and friendly. First class service.
6/25/18,5,Excellent customer service
6/25/18,5,"Knowledgeable salesman, relaxed atmosphere with good customer service"
6/25/18,5,It has been an absolute pleasure to buy a mini from Cooper. Nothing was too much trouble for Becky who dealt with us and Lucy who helped with additional policies. Would not hesitate in buying from them again or recommending them.
6/25/18,5,"Great customer service.. kept informed on all of the work being undertaken. Whilst I do need to bring the car back for some geometry checks, it was my choice to re-book that or Mercedes would have simply completed the work the following day. Catherine was excellent in her updates. Second time I’ve used this dealership and both occasions/experiences were great!"
6/25/18,5,"Very easy to book
Great welcome and kept informed throughout the service by a video and the Service Receptionist.
Nice relaxed atmosphere.
Recommended."
6/25/18,4,"Overall the experience was far from ideal. I'd booked online selecting the 9th and the confirmation email stated the 23rd. No where in that email did it say the 9th wasn't available so I travelled to the garage on the 9th which was partly my own fault for not reading the whole email. I just assumed that since I asked for the 9th that it was correct. Then the timings on google state it doesn't open till 9 but the booking process said 8 leaving some confusion. Overall staff were very helpful, the online process not so good, leaving me disappointed in the experience."
6/25/18,5,Excellent experience at Audi in Tunbridge Wells. Joe Cochrane was great and my new car purchase went as smooth as silk. Recommend without reservation.
6/25/18,5,"Great service for the purchase of new car. No hard sell, clear and easy purchase"
6/25/18,3,"No problems, car returned in good time, had been cleaned quite well"
6/25/18,5,Perfect service - highly recommend
6/25/18,5,"Good experience over a short period to ensure car was ready for collection as planned. Video presentation the day before to show everything was ready.

Collection of car also very straight forward."
6/25/18,5,"Excellent service, really pleased with the servicing of my car which included pick up and delivery and it was returned valeted and sparkling. Great customer service too."
6/24/18,5,"Very pleased with service all round at Inchcape. Pleasant booking in a service over the phone and from then on pleasant and efficient to deal with. I can happily recommend!
( Inchcape are a very welcome change from Farnells, Bury branch, who are truly shocking in customer care.... Goodbye forever to them!)
Thank you Inchcape until next time!........I'll be back."
6/24/18,3,"Felt that the service desk reception was unwelcoming when dropping my car off. But this was much improved when collection my car.
The price of the service was somewhat of a shock due to the brake disk replacement."
6/24/18,1,"I’ve arranged a car service with BMW Cooper Banstead and this was carried out on 18th June 2018 however this wasn’t carried out to my expectations.
When we’ve brought the car home we’ve noticed that the service book hasn’t been stamped to confirm that as service was conducted and what checks has been carried out. From the invoice notice that a video was made however the staff at BMW Cooper Banstead did not explained, mentioned or give us any details on how we access this.
Notice how unprofessional did they fill the online service history as attached where the oil engine and the brake fluid – replacement carried out on time however the filters have been replaced late – how is this possible. Usually when the engine oil is replaced then the filters are replaced in the same time and it would be recommended that the microfilter is replaced too. It is evident that who fills this information on “connecteddrive” isn’t trained or have any knowledge for sure with regards to the info to input here.

We did call BMW Cooper Banstead on the 19th June 2018 and ask for “Mr Greg” the one who was responsible with the service of our car to explain why the service book hasn’t been stamped and at date we are writing this we haven’t heard back from the branch since.
The prices are excessively higher and nowadays there are garages which offer a better service overall."
6/24/18,5,"Only one thing I when I delivered my car for service at 10 o'clock I was told that my car would be ready for collection between 5 & 6pm !
When I booked the service was told that it would take 90 minutes ! Bit of confusion.
Other than that all was fine !"
6/24/18,3,"New showroom great, but....after being greeted on arrrival by reception and told to wait in the waiting area, it was then 25 mins before anyone came to see me.
When I did receive attention it was fine and the service was good."
6/23/18,5,BMW were fantastic when I bought my 340i there deals are very competitive and the staff do a fantastic job very friendly and helpful
6/23/18,1,"Had to wait nearly 3 hours for the car to be ready, when it was presented it hadn’t been cleaned, broke down within 5 miles of dealership, it was your good fortune that I bumped into a wall on my return or you would of been giving me my money back.
M Southwell"
6/23/18,5,Great service and the car was beautifully cleaned.
6/23/18,5,Great service from an exceptional sales person (Lisa). No question a star performer who could not have been more helpful. The whole inchcape experience was flawless and the car is brilliant.
6/23/18,4,"Very smooth service. Waited in the showroom for my car to be finished, comfortable surroundings."
6/23/18,5,"Superb customer service from Mark. Excellent. He is a credit to BMW Reading and a very good reason to come back, hopefully I'll be lucky to have my BM looked after by him next time. Thanks to the rest of the team also. What a team! Top, top."
6/22/18,5,"Recently bought a mini from Cooper Colchester and Hilary was fantastic- great communication, very helpful and arranged part exchange, delivery and collection to me in Aberdeen.
Car was exactly as described and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.
Highly recommend this company and would use again"
6/22/18,5,"Had the water pump and timing belt changed. Did online booking and I was allowed to book a Saturday slot for this work, but got a phone call informing me I had to book it in during the week, not ideal for me, but they gave me a courtesy car which aliviated my issues. I dealt with Tom who was efficient and sorted all the paperwork out quickly. Very happy and only slightly more than a local garage would have cost for this work, and I got VW parts, warranty, a visual health check, plus a courtesy car."
6/22/18,5,"Very prompt service
Excellent customer service
I am very pleased"
6/22/18,2,"Very expensive for basic oil change, screen wash not filled up on a £273 first service - very poor. Car given complimentary wash shame the wheels still filthy on one side of the car. No parking spaces in the overcrowded dealership another customer (who had a space) waited as they were blocked until someone found the keys of the abandoned car. Service staff very friendly and accommodating all thought will probably look elsewhere next time. At that price I expected more."
6/22/18,1,"Came in for a recall on a positive battery cable/terminal. Waited from 1pm to 2pm for anyone to take my keys for my 1.15pm appointment (despite already speaking to 2 receptionists on arrival). Job completed and received completion form at 3.15pm and told no other problems found(i assume from the health check i was told it would have at booking), told my keys will be back with me shortly. Receptionist returns about 4pm with no keys and claiming mechanics/engineers dont think they have even had my car yet! (What a joke!) Get keys just after 4 and leave despite noticing the very poor valet job inside and out but had enough and just wanted to leave.

Next day get in car and turn blowers on for the first time, nothing! Full power, nothing coming out. Tried turning temp up and down, turning AC on and off, blowers off and on several times, car/ignition on and off. Still nothing.

Had to message Coopers on Facebook as they had closed for the day, get automated reply saying will be contacted in morning. Message at 8.30am apologising and i will have someone call me soon after asking for REG and Tel No.
11.30 no call so messaged again, i was assured someone will be in touch very soon, 1.30 still no call so rang coopers myself and went in to have it sorted. Not happy about having to make 2x30 mile round trips for something they messed up on. Eventually get told that my blowers arent working because there isn't a fuse in for them! Really?! After having the car for roughly 4 years and using the blowers regularly my fuse has up and walked off that day and no one has an answer for that?! I get the usual we are sorry it wasn't there we will put in another, why not own up to it? Did it dissolve? Was it banished by thanos? The fact these are more viable explanations of what happened to it, compared to the one i was given, is ridiculous. 100% worst experience i have ever had from start to finish. I can understand why people wont pay the ridiculous prices for BMWs service with such poor quality in return. Would not recommend this place to anyone!"
6/22/18,2,Went in for puncture repair and after collection of vehicle had to take it back as job had not been completed properly with inadequate air pressure in repaired tyre...................then kept waiting a further 45 minutes to get it put right. there seems to me to be a communications issue between departments
6/22/18,4,I needed my car serviced in a hurry and Jamie-Lee was able to sort things out very quickly.
6/22/18,5,"Excellent service, the staff were very friendly. Jamie who sold the car to us was very professional and we came away feeling very happy with our purchase."
6/22/18,5,Very polite and professional service advisor who delivered exactly what was discussed when checking in my vehicle for its service. Was made to feel like a valued customer and would definitely recommend to others.
6/22/18,5,"Really well looked after by Christopher Belch, found the right car for us (our 6th Mercedes) and very professional all the way through. Attention to detail first rate and nothing was too much trouble. Looking forward too my next visit to Mercedes Benz in Warrington and our next purchase in a few years time."
6/22/18,5,"I had arranged for the pickup of my BMW for service and mot. On the morning this was due I needed to change the time of pickup to much earlier due to me having a horrid toothache. 30 minutes later the guys were on my doorstep to sort out the change of vehicles. Now that's what I call service, at a time I really needed Durham Cooper BMW were brilliant."
6/22/18,2,Expensive and poor customer services
6/22/18,4,Very good service Jo was extremely pleasant
6/22/18,5,Very happy with the smooth running of buying a new car. Kinga was thorough with everything and explaining different options with me so that I could chose what was best for me. All round extremely happy with it all and my new car!
6/22/18,5,excellent good old fashioned customer service like it should be. Surpassed my expectations and delighted from the moment i was met at the door by a service technician until the moment i left.. A special mention for the charming Jamie Lee. Highly recommended!!
6/22/18,4,"Why do salesmen keep going back and forward to their manager and come back with nothing is there any real saving for the customer and how do we know
We all know they are ripping us off we have to keep it to a minimum not easy"
6/22/18,5,Excellent service from Keith Richardson when I bought my replacement Range Rover.
6/22/18,2,"We booked our car into coopers for a safety recall, we asked for fast lane service and were told the job would take 1.5 hours,
The job took 4.5 hours to complete!,!
Not good!"
6/22/18,5,"Our Smart Car in for its first service. All done whilst I had a walk on the sea front and had a coffee.
Can’t fault the attention given to the service. Many thanks


PETER BYRNE"
6/22/18,5,"Very pleasant service desk staff - friendly helpful and honest. Had the cars first major service and first MOT - was given some options for extended service intervals and some summer service packs, which would overall work out more cost effective for me due to the high mileages I cover. Also found some offers for me which brought the final cost down too."
6/22/18,4,Very good - made changing cars easy.
6/22/18,5,"This was my very first visit to Swindon Audi and a well deserved 5 Star Review.
The team were professional, polite and helpful.
Barry in servicing kept me updated with the progress on my car, The reception team were brilliant.
On collecting my car I was helped by lady who went above and beyond my expectations of the dealership.
Overall first class, Thank you."
6/22/18,5,"Fabulous service lee Wilkinson dealt all the time with my car and updated where my car was in production, that was exciting and I gave my car for part exchange, they done service in no time.I recommend any one to buy car in this place I love my mini cooper:) Thankyou for all your help Lee.You are a star keep it up."
6/22/18,3,"When you call to book in, it's a call centre & not the dealership.
Call centre were officious and ""customer is wrong"" in tone and manner.
Came across as we do it our way & not to suit the customer - cited lack of resources as a reason not to offer me a lift and cited no cars free to give me a loan car - I wouldn't expect a non-premium marque to say this.
When I arrived at the dealership, they did not do what the vehicle had been booked in for, so after 90 minutes they came back to tell me that the car needed the work doing to it that I had brought it in to get carried out!
I complained, and lo and behold a loan car was suddenly available!
When the car was returned a service light - overdue service; though it isn't overdue is now on.
The dealership did their best & were apologetic, BUT other dealers have looked after me better - this is the supplying dealer and my contract is nearly up - will I go to this dealership for my next car; based on this experience I doubt. I also placed a comment on a social media post that a senior manager posted - they did not feel it warranted a response nor a Private Message. So not feeling valued and Daimler wonder why sales/profits are sliding - it's not just World trade issues"
6/22/18,1,Well I brought used car got it drop off my gargage too get check over found quite few things wrong with it can't belive it left main dealership like that so dispointed & customer service /after service not good take ages for them to get back to you I had I phone loads to get them to pick car in all whole week now they had car for two days now one rang me back & about re fund
6/22/18,5,"Excellent car, sales team and experience, I'm very pleased with my purchase."
6/22/18,5,"Collected my car, did all the work as advised, sent me a complementary video and dropped by car off early. Can't expect more than that."
6/22/18,5,Very helpful fantastic service
6/22/18,5,Excellent service - collected my car by an very polite driver and left back the same day all serviced and cleaned. Cannot ask for more than that. Very happy customer here...
6/22/18,5,"Would 100% go through sophie and mercedes benz cheshire oaks inchape again, this is the 5th car I've purchased and this was by far the best service, have already recommended both parties more than once since my recent purchase. very happy with it from start to finish.

thanks

Ste."
6/22/18,5,"Hassle free from start to finish. From booking the service to having the car collected and returned, friendly polite and efficient personnel."
6/22/18,5,Knowledgeable staff and courteous service
6/22/18,5,"Very efficient, no pressure and good prices."
6/22/18,5,Excellent service mirroring the quality of the product. Many thanks to Gemma Black who certainly went the extra mile by coming in on her day off as this was the only time we were available. We would have no hesitation in recommending Mercedes Benz Liverpool.
6/22/18,5,"First class customer service. Setting the standard.
I only wish BMW did a tourer electric 520 as I am being forced to leave BMW and try a Mercedes which I do not want."
6/22/18,5,Very pleased with the service I got from Anothony. He is a credit to the company. Thanks again for helping me with my new car.
6/21/18,4,"Had a slight hiccup with an Inchcape dealership, spoke to Emma at Inchcape who resolved the issue in two days so would use again.

Thanks
Emma"
6/21/18,5,"Great customer service, and great cars"
6/21/18,5,Fantastic service and very helpful. They called me to remind me my service was due and kept me fully informed of progress. Very helpful and would highly recommend.
6/21/18,5,Polite professional service is always given
6/21/18,5,"I had my brake pads, discs and sensors replaced yesterday on my XKR following advice from Brian last Saturday. The excellent communications and high level of technical knowledge exhibited translated to good customer focus and gave me high levels of confidence in the team. Translating information from the workshops via the service desk to the customer is key and this dealership has got it right. As a result I am switching my ongoing vehicle maintenance to this centre. Top work."
6/21/18,5,very very very satisfied brilliant staff and service
6/21/18,5,"Experience incredibly positive. Lovely reception, everything straight forward and easy. No complications. Video footage was really appreciated. No additional costs."
6/21/18,5,"Excellent from reception to Jo on service counter, to picking up my clean car. Thanks"
6/21/18,5,"Very smooth and enjoyable experience buying from Cooper BMW Norwich. Constructive and thoughtful advice given, meticulous attention to detail and finding the right car for my needs made this the best car-buying experience I’ve had. James Hurn was very patient and knowledgeable, going out of his way to make sure I was happy with each stage of the process and once the car had arrived, he ensured that the condition of the car was spot-on. I can honestly say this has been a purchase that I can look back on with no regrets or mis-givings."
6/21/18,5,"After buying the WRONG CAR from another L/R dealer and deciding, after 5 weeks, that I just couldn't keep it, I went to Inchcape(Hunters) in Southampton fearing the worst. I was expecting to loose quite a bit of money but no, they sorted me out and I came away happy. I traded in a Disco 4 for a Freelander 2. Have to say that it was a good experience and James my salesman was very professional and extremely helpful. I would totally recommend Hunters to friends and family.
Thanks to all
Keithbuster"
6/21/18,4,"From the phone service to the end journey was effortless ,
Ellie Farrell the service advisor that dealt with me was fantastic,she was very professional and helpful with my one and only query,
She is a credit to the company and deserves a recognition"
6/21/18,5,Really great service from Kal in the Liverpool showroom from start to finish would recommend this salesman to friends
6/21/18,5,"Leicester Mercedes were brilliant they arranged to pick my car up at the
House they collected the car on time and returned it early afternoon
had a service and check over. good job guys"
6/21/18,5,"Best looking showroom! Visited the showroom to test a used 5 Series, which we ended up buying a week later, totally delighted with the quality of the vehicle. The customer service was exceptional.Very good experience, one happy customer"
6/21/18,4,"I gave my car for servicing & MOT check & the experience was very good. As a courtesy car I was given a brand new E class to drive. I got back the car on time & everything was explained to me very well by Tim who was very friendly & courteous.
I gave a 4 and not a 5 because the person who received me first in the morning of 20th June who was a young guy was a bit rough & aggressive calling me mate & buddy, even though I am at least 15 years older than him. Another lady named Seema was also quite rude & curt while talking to me on the phone when I had asked some details about the service. This was my second visit to this showroom. The first was almost 10 months back when I wanted to buy a car and did not buy it from here as I found Catherine & Alvin very rude & pushy. I bought my car from Mercedes Inchcape Derby instead and they were very good. But I had to come back to this showroom as the service was due for the car.
Someone needs to look at the customer service dept here. The people working in the service dept are good."
6/21/18,5,Excellent well recommended
6/21/18,5,"Having bought from Toyota before I expect the expert quality of service expected, and they did not let me down. Kind and considerate sales personel help me choose my car without harassment. Always a pleasure doing business with them."
6/21/18,5,warm friendly helpful
6/21/18,5,"I was kept informed by Inchcape from collection of my vehicle for service all the way through to delivery back to me. I received a text message advising what time my vehicle went into the servicing bay and this was followed up with an email showing the work carried out along with the results of the service. Excellent Customer Service all round, couldnt fault the experience."
6/21/18,5,"New to the process, everything explained plainly and was a seamless process.
Excellent"
6/21/18,5,"Excellent service from start to finish with this garage i think they must have pinched the best staff from all the top dealerships in UK.
Well Done."
6/21/18,5,"Was a fast, effiecent service with polite,tentative staff. The salesman Tom Kernahan, who sold me the car recognised me and made an effort to say hello which was a nice gesture. One thing to point out though.... the customer waiting area had Jeremy Kyle on, on the large TV. I found it an odd choice given it was all about sex tapes and masturbation.... would think BBC news 24/7 would perhaps be more appropriate whilst one waits for a car service."
6/21/18,5,Martin Tickle was very helpful from start to finish on purchasing my Mercedes C Class Coupe. From initially advising based on no sales opportunity he committed valuable time and information to help me understand what model of car was right for me. This ultimately led to a sale 2 weeks later when I revisited the warrington site for further information. Martin pulled out all the stops he could to make me happy from extra visits to staying late to suit me. Everything Martin promised was delivered on time and professionally. Thanks Martin for all your help.
6/21/18,5,Nice and happy
6/21/18,5,"I have recently purchased a used Mercedes C180 from Warrington Mercedes. Very easy transaction mainly due to the salesman Graham O'Conner .
No pressure and very knowledgeable."
6/21/18,1,"My car (Range Rover) was recovered by the AA following an engine fault. It sat with Inchcape Hunters for 6 days without any contact from the garage so I had to contact them to ask whether anyone had looked at the large grey Range Rover parked in their service area. They had not. What followed was disaster after disaster:
1. Calls are diverted, held for long periods and staff are generally not contactable., Messages rarely resulting in a timely call back.
2. When I registered dissatisfaction the service team became rude and on one occasion put the phone down.
3. I was told the ""fault"" was fixed when what they really meant was that they had serviced the vehicle but had not bothered to look at the items specifically detailed as requiring repair. All in all I felt they the people I spoke to were just dishonest.

All this took two weeks to resolve - and would have been longer had I not spent several hours on the phone making sure the garage actually did what it was requested to do.

To top it all off, two days after getting the vehicle back I then received a video of the service showing me my ""heavily worn"" brake pads. The worker said the pads now need changing and in any event within the next 10k miles. Needless to say, the brake pads were not replaced - and no-one thought to ask about doing this work whilst the vehicle was at the garage! I don't know what to say!

I have had the misfortune of using Hunters (now Inchcape) on various occasions over the last 10 years (sadly some things have to be done by the authorised dealer) and they never seem to change. Customers are very much the second priority here. I would actively avoid using this garage for anything - including sales (where I have had similar poor experience). My experience is shared by a number of my farm neighbours in North Norfolk so that we have persuaded a local garage near Holt to get a land rover specialist in so that they can handle servicing properly. I hope this gets going.

Please heed this warning - avoid Hunters in Norwich. I really don't know how this place manages to survive. Big changes in culture and personnel required here before I will go any near them again."
6/21/18,2,"The customer service experience was very disappointing.
I have visited the customer area within servicing on 3 occassions and have been left disappointed every time.
I have just stood there for several minutes and the staff just walk past me rather than asking if they can help. This needs to improve - poor service."
6/21/18,5,Always very helpful and good communication with customers.
6/20/18,5,Tried a full service with home pick up of vehicle and I think it worked a treat. A call in the morning to update and a call when car was almost ready.
6/20/18,5,"Efficient, confident but friendly service. I was provided with an excellent hire car for the day, and my car was ready slightly earlier than they predicted. It was returned to me fully valeted."
6/20/18,5,"excellent service, vehicle booked in on time, good feedback, good performance."
6/20/18,5,"Brilliant service.
Everything they say, they do"
6/20/18,5,"The team at Mini Cooper Reading were amazing! I truly cannot thank them enough for helping to me see my dream car become a reality! Friendly, helpful, and relaxed, no part of my engagement with them has been difficult. No hard sell, giving me what I wanted and going the extra mile to make the experience exciting and fun. THANK YOU!! Adnan in particular was brilliant."
6/20/18,5,"After already owning a BMW, going to another of the top brands (landrover) not receiving the service and commitment to find a car to the spec I wanted, I found myself going back to bmw to find my next car. The budget I had was not a problem unlike other dealers, who didn't seem to want to do the work. Bmw, especially James Richardson, couldnt do enough for me, so friendly, weren't pushy at all, and didn't try to sell you something that you didn't need just to reach your max limit. Nothing was too much trouble, any help needed would be available whenever I want to call. The after service is just as important as the sale. Great job bmw coopers Norwich (and James)."
6/20/18,5,My visit to Cooper Sunderland was to have my BMW serviced. My wife and I were greeted by the lovely Brenda at reception and were shown to our designated service advisor Stewart. We were served coffee whilst the service formalities were completed and Stewart took note of two queries I had about the operation of my car. We were advised when the vehicle would be ready and arrived at the appointed time to be looked after by Brenda again while the service report was completed at which time we were taken to Stewart who answered my queries very comprehensively and gave a run down of the service carried out and alerted me to the nearside rear tyre possibly needing replacement before the winter and that everything else was fine. Great service as always. Would not go anywhere else. Great service and great staff. Have been using this dealer for around 18 years.
6/20/18,5,Very friendly and helpful receptionist and Dan was very helpful and offered alternatives where needed. A very helpful fellow
6/20/18,4,"I had booked in for a brake fluid service and a free Spring Health check. All went smoothly and I was sent a video of the health check explaining faults found. However, it was not explained that the video was just of the health check so I had to telephone to make sure that the requested work had been done.

I returned to collect my car after I'd been told it was ready. Unfortunately, I had to wait 30 minutes for the service adviser to return, having been told that he was in the workshop and, after 15 minutes, that he had been told I was waiting. He was apologetic but the delay undid any goodwill built up by the earlier good service."
6/20/18,5,Excellent Service. All done on time and without fuss.
6/20/18,5,"I was discomforted by the call centre booking who were unable to give me a first start time for my service.I wished to visit a granddaughter in hospital in the afternoon.However,at Southport Carl was extremely helpful and supportive.He applied a discount for my I convenience and did a replacement fuse at the last minute."
6/20/18,5,"If only all mercedes dealerships were as efficient as Warrington.
Very up to date technology,
with the e-mail video view/ commentary one hour after checking in.
A special mention to a young lady named Gemma who has all the people skills to go far.

6/20/18,2,"I am dissatisfied with the service provided. Let me explain, I have booked an appointment with Cooper BMW Durham in Midmay and this was cancelled the evening before the appointment due to unavailability of parts and I was told that they will rebook in a week’s time but never received a call back so had to call them back after 3weeks to book another appointment and this time I dropped the car at 8:30am and agreed to hand it back at 5:00pm with a wash and hoover done. Surprisingly no call to me on any updates. I went to Cooper BMW Durham at 5pm to collect the car expecting it to be ready by then and they kindly asked me to wait. so, at around 5:30pm I was told that your car is ready but without a wash nor hoover done for which I was upset. Here itself they have broken their said ten customer commitments which they have proudly written in their showroom. Later I received the car at about 6:20pm with just a wash. Unhappy."
6/20/18,4,Very friendly and helpful staff. Work completed early and satisfactory
6/20/18,4,The problem of not giving five stars is that it was hard to get through to book a service on the telephone
6/20/18,5,"Car was in for service, picked up from and delivered back home at times agreed.. All aspects of the appointment efficiently and courteously managed."
6/20/18,5,car collected and returned free. Polite and friendly 'collecter' on time on both occasions. Car immaculately clean.
6/20/18,5,"Collected the car from my home the evening before, kept me updated on the progress. Sent me a video showing the advisory on the M.O.T. They brought the car back washed and inside hoovered. The only fault I found was they were a bit pricey on there tyre quote."
6/20/18,5,"Really excellent service pleasant waiting area with refreshments,
Friendly very efficient staff service was complete in the stated time would not hesitate to use this dealership again."
6/20/18,5,Excellent service and communication.
6/20/18,1,"Would never go to Swindon Audi garage to fix our Q7, poor comunication and customer services, appointments not being met, had it booked in and wasn't looked at until 3 days later then given a wrong diagnostics, they wanted to charge us for work that didn't doing, and then a new Turbo when one is not needed, as they can not be bothered to fix a part that needed fixing. Money grabbing company!! Totally against the FCA and Trading Standards. Optinons given your turbo is in great condition, however we won't change the part you need we will change the turbo!! you can go to another garage and have the part changed tow your vehicle back and then we will programme it so you can drive it!! Absolute Joke!!! Would never recommend any one to use or buy from Swindon Audi. If you don't want to be ripped off then don't use the Swindon Branch"
6/20/18,5,"Delighted with my new S3 and with the team at Tetbury Audi, especially Alex Brookes the Sales Executive. Alex was extremely helpful throughout the whole process, including a test drive and the part exchange of my old vehicle."
6/20/18,5,Professional from start to finish
6/20/18,1,"Purchased a Mercedes in March 2018 with it being advertised with FULL Main Dealer Mercedes Service History, and was told it was last serviced in October 2017. Upon collecting the car it came to light that the car was serviced in April 2017, we were then given the opportunity to have a free service at their garage but as it supposedly had Mercedes History we declined as wanted to maintain the Main Dealer Mercedes history, so we were given some free fuel (no way near the cost of the service).

After a struggle to get it booked into inchape Mercedes in Derby for a service it came to light that the car didn't have Full Mercedes history! The advert for the car aswell as the the video the salesman made before we travelled to view the car and phonecalls with them all show that they advertised and sold this vehicle with Mercedes Main Dealer history!! A MAJOR FAIL from a dealer of this size!

Made a complaint through inchcape and offered a poor resolution!

UPDATE: We have raised this with the Motor Ombudsman and INCHAPE have not responded after months..

Also sending this to FCA for the way they try and MISS SELL finance products!"
6/20/18,5,"I’ve now purchased 9 cars from east Kent Audi
And always used the sales executive Harry Bryant . Lastest purchases this month were my new Q7 and the new Q2 for my wife.
Harry is extremely professional & polite as are all the team that greet you, I would highly recommend the entire services of east Kent Audi ."
6/19/18,5,"Again a first class service with Inchape Coventry. Took us through all the details of the service and MOT in easy to understand way, cant fault them in anyway."
6/19/18,5,All good very pleased
6/19/18,5,"I received excellent service from Mercedes Loughborough, particularly from Emile. Thank you."
6/19/18,1,"Cooper Norwich
Arranged one of these much advertised 'drive it your way' test drives. Gave plenty of notice on my online booking form (13 days) of the car I was looking to drive, the date and time, confirmation received. All planned to coincide with service on my own BMW. Leave key with service desk and they take me over to the reception for my hand over to sales. Took 20 minutes for sales guy to turn up (product genius actually turned up) and then complete farce ensued - didn't have model choice - would I want to try something else, er no, that's why I requested the car I requested - what if I get you something close - er no again - and so it continued topped off by guy saying he would be accompanying my test drive if I decided to go !!
Gave up, returned to service desk relayed story, said they would raise issue with sales manager. 15 mins later said sales manager turns up - admitted that no one had actually read the request, knew nothing about it and besides, the small print says that not all cars are stocked - well excuse me for giving you nearly 2 weeks notice for said car, nobody thought to let me know!! Clearly my fault !!!
Had this several times before here, service dept is excellent, sales side have a whole upper level of arrogance few will be able to better......choose any other BMW dealer to do business with."
6/19/18,5,"Fantastic Customer Service from start to finish. The sales Executive Carl at the Approved Used dealer in Hyde was extremely helpful, courteous and understanding of my specific requirements and no hard sell what so ever. My Audi A3 was in immaculate condition throughout and my overall experience of the car buying purchase was an excellent one. Would highly recommend to anyone."
6/19/18,4,"Seen a few bad reviews but from boking in (and changing my apointment twice no problem) was a good experiance, only issue was the car was clean through a small change went missing not good."
6/18/18,1,"My car was booked in for an MOT plus a few other maintenance points. I had an email confirming this but only the MOT was carried out after waiting for over 3 hours. On challenging this I was told it wasn’t on the job sheet and there was nothing they could do. I insisted on the other things being looked into and reluctantly the next thing on the list was done. The people I dealt with were disinterested and had no idea of customer service, blaming everybody else. When I asked to speak to the person in charge I was told there wasn’t anyone in charge. I left my number so that the person could ring me on the next working day and no one called. Appalling experience from start to finish."
6/18/18,5,"Great service, clear information about the whole process of buying my mini."
6/18/18,5,"I've just bought a new car from Toyota in Basingstoke and the whole process was seamless. All staff were very welcoming and friendly with no pressure! Communication was great all the way through and I knew exactly what was happening and when.
My handover was very thorough.
I would definetly recommend them."
6/18/18,5,"Came in to get a map update & air con regass for my 6 Series. Had a great experience at the Service Desk from Tom who was professional & swiftly took all the details & arranged my courtesy car - a 530d which was much appreciated.

All sorted by 2pm & returned to a nice clean car & bill sorted out swiftly without any fuss or issues.

BMW Norwich clearly have a great team.

Thank you."
6/18/18,5,"Nice showroom, great waiting lounge for the service team with coffee machine and squash available. Service reception was prompt, courtesy car was great amd video update to my phone of the issues found was perfect. Overall good service at a reasonable price"
6/18/18,5,"Excellent service thank you no issues at all, helpful friendly staff"
6/18/18,5,Excellent service. They made buying a car incredibly easy
6/18/18,5,"Having it been my first time taking out finance and a new car, the sales advisor (Jad) was very helpful answered all questions and queries and made me feel very reassured and excited for collecting my new car. Really friendly and presentable staff. Reccomended car garage."
6/18/18,5,"I started at the Inchcape centre at Thames Ditton but I found the service was terrible, no one was interested in seeing me, the receptionist told me no one available but staff were sitting at desks playing with their mobiles, after half an hour of waiting for someone to book me in for a spring checkup and asking the receptionist one last time how much longer I had to wait and her reply was still vague, I left and went to the centre at Cobham.
Wow, what a complete difference it was, as I walked into the centre, I was greeted with a smile from the lady at the desk, not a frown, I was directed to another lady who asked me to sit down and offered me a drink with the reassurance that someone would be with me shortly not, no one was available and don’t know when someone would be able to help me, no sooner had I sat down with a coffee I was called over to a service desk where, with a nothings too much attitude I had a date booked for my car to come in and I was walking out the door in about 15 minuets and extremely satisfied, never again will I set foot in the Thames Ditton branch, which is a shame as that is where I bought my car. Well done Cobham, see you again soon."
6/18/18,5,"Excellent service, have bought from them before and went back for my second VW. First class service with a personal touch ( and the coffee's not too bad !) I dealt with John Muldoon on both occasions and to be honest you would not find a better guy, listens understands and gets the car that's right for you. Seriously go there you won't be disappointed. Tell them I sent you"
6/18/18,5,Matt was excellent in providing the right deal for me!
6/18/18,5,"Staff polite and helpfull, service completed ahead of estimated time, Livvy was very professional, friendly and knew her job well, a credit to the company,,thankyou"
6/18/18,2,I had my rear brake light (on the top of the boot) and when I pick my car up it had dirty greasy fingerprints all over the top of the boot. I don't expect this kind of service from BMW main dealers.
6/18/18,4,Recent purchase of a used Audi Q5. Turned around and driven away in 4 days. Kept informed of progress and was always available to speak to with any queries. Would recommend.
6/18/18,5,"When I first walked into the Audi garage I was greeted, the receptionist was miserable and quite frankly that put me off even looking let alone buying. But then Georgette greeted me. She made me feel like my time was important to get and listened to everything I wanted. She walked me round a few cars and took me to the ones I had been viewing. I was right on time but she made her schedule work around me. She gave excellent service and went above and beyond. She really is an asset to the company. Without her standard of service and shining personality I can guarantee I would not of purchased from the Audi Crawley branch due to the lack of service i saw when I took my first steps inside."
6/18/18,1,"Waited too long to be served, over 30 mins each side of dropping off my car and picking it up. Failed the MOT on a bald tyre and told to get one fitted myself and comeback to get the MOT sign off, as the tyre person was away. I will never return to Mini to service and MOT my Mini. I have found a cheaper and more local garage, that has a better customer service and lower prices."
6/18/18,5,"As a customer of Cooper BMW Reading for many years, the service received on my visit last week was of the level I have experienced many times. Efficient, professional and friendly. I will continue to use Coopers as long as the service levels remain as good as they currently are"
6/18/18,5,Efficient service all round
6/18/18,5,"Visited one Land Rover dealer six times and left frustrated six times, visited Hunters at Kings Lynn once and inside two hours had purchased a motor. Received excellent service and advice from Gary Steeles."
6/18/18,5,"Spot on ! Worked hard to find the appointment to fit our busy schedule. Did everything asked and all ready to collect at agreed time.
Nothing else to add but our thanks !"
6/18/18,5,"Great service from Jessica and all the service team.
Checking in and picking up my courtesy car was slick and I was extremely impressed by the You Tube video the engineer sent me on my tyres.
I do have to return to the garage today as my service warning message has come back on, but I am assured the process will be quite quick.
Thank you Team Inchcape!"
6/18/18,3,"Did not quite get that ""feeling"" that I have had from my regular centre - Teesside Audi - Number of things that dissapointed me - was told I could not have an upgrade for my Sat Nav unless I paid £250 - I did not get a cal that my car was ready to be picked up even though I was told that that would happen - was told my fluid levels would be topped up but shortly after leaving the centre I got the warning light that Adblue need to be added - so that fluid had not been filled - was told that the car would be vacuumed but when I looked in the boot later next day then it was quite evident that the boot had not been touched"
6/18/18,5,"Used for a couple of years now for my service and MOT. They even pick up the car from your house and, if using that particular service, send a video from the mechanic looking under the car and talking through the work needed. Recent MOT was cheaper than expected and even talked me out of some expensive work I thought needed doing - the opposite to some I've used before! Highly impressed by them all round."
6/18/18,3,"All in all an okay experience however I was told that my vehicle would be ready between 4-6 and I would be contacted when it was ready to pick up. I had stated that we were going away for the weekend and if it could be available for pick up sooner that would be appreciated. Unfortunately by ten past 6 we still hadn't received a call, I called the dealer ship and they had missed it because one of the engineers that was working on my car had to leave urgently, therefore it had been ready earlier however no one had called us to notify us the vehicle was ready. When I picked the vehicle up the staff were extremely apologetic. When collecting the car, the member of staffing I was dealing with mentioned that the valet is part and parcel of the service. The car had been washed and the inside looked to have been started however the foot well mats for the back seats were still on the seat and it generally felt like it had been rushed or just started due to the service engineer having to leave in a hurry. Like I say all in all okay but it could have been a little better."
6/18/18,4,"Booked Service and told it was £600+. Was not advised of other options when I booked (up to this point it was previously as company car but I purchased it recently.)
When I came to pay was told of monthly service plan which knocks £200 off bringing it more in line with what I pay for other vehicles such as Land Rover.

Why are we left hanging outside with doors locked when times clearly state that Service opens at 08:00. Had 4 services at Oxford branch and all times I have had to wait for doors to be unlocked.

Finally, why do we have to pay for Courtesy cars? Most other garages provide for free.

Otherwise a fab service."
6/18/18,5,"Excellent service from the selling of the car, help, keeping in touch and the handover! Every aspect was covered, mainly due to Noel and Glen’s great help at Mini Cooper Norwich!"
6/18/18,3,"Took my car for the safety recall on the steering colum airbag. Reception was good and the technician came out promptly to take my keys. I was told 1-2 hours and only waited 50 mins. However on getting to my car and driving away the steering wheel lock had not been put on and although a small annoyance the clock had not been reset after the job. I rang in returning home and explained that this was my first visit and not too impressed! I received a verbal apology from the receptionist who advised she would inform the technician. Not the most positive experience, hope no errors with the safety recall work!"
6/18/18,5,"I initially visited the showroom with a view to buying an E Pace and saw Joe Carey who was very helpful .After seeing an F Pace and organising a test drive I decided that model was more suitable for my purposes. Joe came up with a good part exchange offer to enable to proceed with the purchase of the vehicle which I'm extremely pleased with. Joe was very professional and I would have no hesitation in recommending him and the other staff to friends and family, I believe friends of mine have already made enquires to purchase an E Pace."
6/18/18,3,"The service assistant, Livvy was really good.
After a poor start of left waiting by the desks instead of being shown to the seating area. This was disappointing as at least 4 staff members walked passed me and didn’t point me in the right direction. I then had to go to the back of the queue, not happy.

Livvy did make up for this poor start.
She also informed me that I wasn’t due a service just MOT. Why couldn’t they inform me when I booked the vehicle in?

Also I’ve had the car for two years now and Mini still keep sending all correspondence through in the name of my husband. Not good"
6/18/18,1,"Very poor. Car returned to me without fully been serviced. (Had request to have the air con serviced but was ignored). On previous visit, message with video was sent to me, this time however did it couldn't care about it."
6/18/18,4,"Friendly service
Very expensive for a service"
6/18/18,5,"Fantastic, such kind and helpful people. 10/10 already have reckonmend to friends and family!"
6/18/18,3,Accounts department let the sales and service team down.
6/18/18,5,Great company to deal with.
6/18/18,5,"Excellent service, friendly and informative staff. Would definately recommend to others."
6/18/18,5,"my experience I must say was a great one, mark in service who I dealt with was my courteous and to the point. He bent over backwards to accommodate my request. Cooper BMW service has really impressed me, that’s the way all dealerships should be!"
6/18/18,1,"Safety check carried out at Hunters, I was told car was in safe running order, took my car to ATS for a second check only to be told my brake pads are 95% worn and need replacing asap. Rang Tim services manager only to told if your not happy take your elsewhere"
6/18/18,5,"Paul my sales contact was excellent. He was efficient, knowledgable, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The service offered by the rest of the team was excellent. The car was better than I had imagined and with the extras that I requested make this a pleasure to own and drive. Looking forward to many happy years of motoring."
6/17/18,5,First class service.
6/17/18,2,"Car went in for a recall item. Battery terminal replacement. Didn't think it would take long. Went in at 08.00. Phoned several times in the afternoon to check progress, promised a call back but never got one. As 17.55 got a recorded message to say would I phone. Tried but their phone system kept dropping the call. Eventually drove to the garage to find out what was going on and eventually pick my car up at 18.15.
Basically it was impossible to make contact with service reception by phone."
6/16/18,5,Excellent service
6/16/18,2,"The sales man decided to tell me the car only came with 1 key after I had purchased the car. Given that the car cost me nearly £27,000 and was less than a year old I told him this was unacceptable and wanted 2 keys. After agreeing to supply me another key, the new key did not work when it arrived. After much emailing and leaving phone messages, I finally managed to a second key that actually worked.
A few weeks later, I then noticed that the car was missing a wind deflector which was meant to be part of the ""comfort package"". BMW Coopers Reading (Inchcape) did agree to supply me with this but i had to pick the part up myself from the dealership and would not send it to me despite it being quite small and light and so easy to send. I got no apology from them for this oversight!
All in all quite poor customer service and not one I would expect from BMW. Why do they not check the car over before selling it??"
6/16/18,5,I bought a used Jaguar XF Sportbrake trading in my Volvo. I was made to feel welcome and given whatever time needed to look at the car and drive it. Barry was very friendly and the whole experience was very good. I had a test drive which confirmed for me this was the car I wanted and I was offered I think a very fair trade in price for my car. The advantage of a 2 years manufacturers warranty and breakdown cover on a used car is very appealing. I had expected to have to pay more than from an independent garage but Inchcape offered by far the best deal. I look forward to using the service department in the future if it is anywhere near as good as the buying experience.
6/16/18,5,"All of the service was very professional at BMW Coopers (Sunderland). The staff were friendly, not pushy and helped us source a car that I am very happy with. I was also happy with the trade-in (price and process) for my old car. I will be going back to them to buy again when my car PCP starts to come near its end."
6/16/18,5,I would like to personally thank Mark Cruikshank and Catia Barbosa of Inchcape Stratford upon Avon Mercedes for my beautiful 2017 E Class Cabriolet which I recently purchased from them. They were thoroughly professional throughout the whole transaction and the car was handed over in A1 condition. Thank you both and I hope we can do business again in the future.
6/16/18,5,"Really terrific experience the staff are friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming."
6/16/18,3,"The handover was conducted by Yin who was very helpful despite being new to the Sales Team and the trade in general. I scored him 5* at the time and that was well deserved.
There were other issues:
1. I had to ask twice before the car was part-filled with petrol.
2. I was surprised to find that the next service is due in November. I expect to have had the benefit of 12 months motoring at least until incurring this expense. I was able to negotiate the November service ""at cost"". I would anticipate an interesting discussion in the future about what constitutes cost!
3. After handover, when setting up the InControl App, I discovered that the vehicle was already connected to another account. It took 3 calls to the dealership before anyone would talk to me about this. The issue was finally resolved some 5 hours after my initial request for assistance.
4. I asked for information about the Thatcher Tracking System. I was not aware that the vehicle was fitted with this and I was concerned that there might be a subscription due. The dealership couldn't help me other than suggesting that I speak to Jaguar's. I phoned them and they told me that the Dealership should have sorted this. They did however provide me with the information I required.
Overall I am left with the impression that the Dealership is penny pinching and staff are inadequately trained. This comes as a surprise to me as I was expecting something much better from a Jaguar dealership. I speak as someone who worked in the motor trade, albeit many years ago. I have experience at various managerial levels, up to and including Dealer Principal. I would not be happy to receive a review of this nature."
6/15/18,5,"Bmw coopers Done really good job today by fixing dsc foult ,replacing a tyre and answered all the questions and went through the whole what’s been done on my ."
6/15/18,2,"Having previously felt well supported and treated with courtesy my recent experience left a lot to be desired. The manager tried to retrieve what started as a difficult situation by kindly driving me to my home. My £164 Service and air conditioning check turned into an £800 bill despite the fact that the car is still under warranty. What really upset me was the utter arrogance of Jirdan who when discussing the hourly labour rate (which is frankly extortionate) described other garages as “back street”. When I challenged him and said I thought it was a rude comment he just said he knew, as he had been a mechanic. Another customer, an elderly lady whose clutch had gone was horrified at her £795 quite. I have suggested she try Autologic in Guildford - where I would have gone myself had my car not supposedly been under warranty. Shane on you Toyota for your poor service and over inflated prices. My thanks to the manager who tried to retrieve the situation, but I am sorry, you have lost me and any recommendations I might have made."
6/15/18,5,"First impressions were fab and they didn't stop there.. the team was so attentive and knowledgeable. Goin through the different specs and budgets to meet my needs. All finance options were explained in detail.
I would highly recommend them"
6/15/18,5,"Very good experience from start to picking up the car 1st time purchasing from a dealer, i hope the after care will meet my expectations! James although new to Audi but not the industry, was very professional and keept me up to date through out."
6/15/18,5,Staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. Answered all of my questions and completed the service ahead of schedule. The costs were very transparent also.
6/15/18,5,As usual I was treated as a really valued customer. First service for my new car and it was picked up on time and delivered back early with all work completed to a high level. It had been valeted to an excellent standard - well done all round BMW!
6/15/18,5,Always a good experience however it is difficult to find a parking spot
6/15/18,5,"Booked a major service & MOT and as I live some distance from Colchester I booked a curtsey car for the day at no extra cost. Work was carried out plus a recall job by the end of the day. One other warranty job needed doing but a part had to be ordered so rebooked for the following week; again with a curtsey car, I was called late afternoon to say car was ready for collection, both times on collection the car had been cleaned and washed. First time I have used Inchcape at Colchester & so far can't fault them."
6/15/18,5,"Just collected my new car which is the 3rd I have purchased over the years from from BMW Cooper Cobham. This time was no exception to the excellent service I have always received. Maxine, Alex, Lee, Ben & Elliot all made sure I was getting the right car, the best deal and kept fully informed at all times. Nothing was too much trouble and always friendly with no pressure. Will be back again next time. Thank you."
6/15/18,1,"I booked an appointment for 9am for a 3 year warranty service plus MOT for my Mini. I arrived a few minutes early - nowhere to park I was told by a mechanic in the workshop to park my car on the road there were no spaces there either - all I was told “oh it’s always busy this time of the morning” Went to reception - no one there - went upstairs and interrupted a client meeting to ask where everyone was. I was told Terry is around and James on a half day. Over half an hour later I met with Terry and things got moving!! There is nowhere to sit in the Mini reception, no offer of coffee or water, I was told if I wanted to sit down I could go upstairs!!
A Taxi took me to Kingston station for which I was grateful - but because of the long wait I missed my train and had to wait half an hour for the next one!!
Last but not least I was told that I would be called when my car was ready to collect around 4pm - no call. I called at 5pm and was told I’d be called back - 5.30pm I was called by then it was too late for me to get to the garage by public transport by closing time 6pm to collect my Mini. All in all a total disaster as I am now up in Manchester until Tuesday and can’t collect until then - most inconvenient . Very poor service. BMW Mini should take a leaf out of the AUDI book - their service is faultless
Diana Cherry"
6/15/18,5,Really good service from booking in to collecting the vehicle when complete. The wash and valet carried out after the service was excellent.
6/15/18,5,Excellent customer services provided by Nathan Westwood.
6/15/18,5,"Excellent service , collection and delivery a great asset. Everyone I had dealings with very polite and helpful Service completed in time frame and car returned very clean. All of you please accept my thanks."
6/15/18,5,Car serviced promptly and valeted. Would recommend.
6/15/18,5,"Polite, caring staff. Professional service throughout. Took the car in with a serious problem that could not be resolved by my local garage. Came away with the problem solved - and the car beautifully cleaned!"
6/15/18,5,"Above average trade in price, below average price on new car. Kept informed all the way along the process. Great people great service. Not one for doing reviews good or bad but Cooper Tonbridge were faultless."
6/15/18,5,Nothing but praise for the service I received. All questions answered. Courtesy and information top notch. Generous instruction and tolerance of an older aged female faultless. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.
6/15/18,5,"Simple, painless, service cost exactly the pre-quote. All checked & valeted, spotless."
6/15/18,5,Happy with overall service
6/15/18,4,"Great customer service today, in and out much quicker than I expected.... but was still here about an hour so took my laptop to do some work while waiting, but the WiFi is appalling! I can't understand why a premium brand like this can't have a WiFi that is fit for purpose, even the engineer agreed how bad it was! Makes it very difficult to work while waiting so often have a loan car when I don't need one, just to be able to work from home while the work is being done! Great wifi would save me doing that and enable someone else to have the loan car instead.... just install decent WiF please!!"
6/14/18,5,Great and fast service. Friendly and excellent customer service!
6/14/18,5,"No issues from booking to picking up cleaned and vacuumed car, efficient process."
6/14/18,5,Great service from all staff but particularly from Kal. He has been friendly professional and helpful throughout. When Kal wasn’t available I was looked after by Serinder on his behalf who was equally helpful. The staff are always welcoming and do their utmost to get the best for you. The whole process of buying a new car has been seamless - I’m absoluteky made up with the service and my new A Class - couldn’t fault them!
6/14/18,5,"I Travelled all the way from Newcastle upon Tyne to look at a car that I had seen advertised on Autotrader. I made the journey following a telephone discussion with the sales person (Andrew). I was met at the train station and given a thorough test run of the car, a Yaris ,in pristine condition, and which exceeded my expectations. Andrew went to considerable lengths to ensure that all my queries were answered. I drove home in a car which I consider to be a tremendous buy and well worth the cost of an expensive rail fare. I would unreservedly recommend Inchcape Toyota."
6/14/18,5,"Stewart who sold us the car was excellent.
Everything that was said was done and all explained.
Test drive was good."
6/14/18,5,"Very helpful professional and curteous team, from the date of arranging the recall to delivering the car, and clear explanation about what will happens and the timing it will take to arrange for the work to be done so you can manage your personal matters around that.

I liked the idea of sending the Vedio for the health check of the car, excellent idea. Many thanks"
6/14/18,5,"Took my car in at 4pm as it had developed an engine fault. Senior engineer looked at it straight away, agreed that something was wrong. A courtesy car took me home. Received a phone call at noon the following day explaining the repair which was needed (a component failure) and that the car was ready to collect. Cooper's service personnel were helpful and courteous at all times and with such a fast job done they are clearly professional and very customer focussed. I have had more hassle at the post office!"
6/14/18,5,Very straight forward experience for buying my new car. Keiran in sales was excellent.

Brilliant service as usual."
6/14/18,5,"I wanted new car didn’t really know what but Sam (male) at Maidstone branch was AMAZING showed me cars I wasn’t even looking at and he picked the car for me . He answered all the questions I had to ask and nothing was to much trouble for him on picking up my car he explained everything in detail .
If I had to rate sam for his part in making a stressful day easy it would have to be 20/10 he went above and beyond .

Thanks Miss S Colley"
6/14/18,5,I found the staff very friendly and polite the customer service was excellent and the work carried out was to my satisfaction
6/14/18,5,Excellent service
6/14/18,3,"Functional but not particularly friendly.
I had arranged a wait in service which on booking was advised would be 90 mins, to be told by the service team member very matter of factly it would be two hours when I got there ‘because it’s a major service’ and they can not tell the service until they get the key- even though I had provided mileage. After over 2.5 hours and having to ask where my car was, it was completed. Some old fashioned customer service training needed - such as smile when you meet a customer for the first time - maybe a hello!"
6/14/18,3,"They've spent circa £1m+ on a state of the art showroom and workshop with fancy sofas, TV's and coffee machines but basic customer care is way off the mark. Both yesterday & today I went to get my car, gave my name and was told ""someone will be out to you in a minute"". Nearly 30 minutes later on both occasions I`m still stood there like a lemon and when I ask if anyone is actually coming to me the same girl I originally spoke to said ""what name is it again?"". I was asked to be there for 8am this morning and could see my car parked up in the fancy new workshop. It took me until 8.45 to actually get my car keys . Very frustrating service."
6/14/18,5,"First class service but too clinical .I would like more contact with staff .
I preferred your old depot ."
6/14/18,5,Our salesperson Rocky made buying the most expensive car we've ever bought almost painless
6/14/18,4,"A little confusion when I first arrived as they had two customers with the same surname booked in that day, but soon resolved. Good service, and Linsey was very polite, professional and friendly. Found an issue with my car during the service. They ordered the part and booked me back in within the week under warranty. And they cleaned the car both times!!"
6/14/18,5,Excellent service as usual here. Great friendly staff and the Garage is top notch. Cannot fault them in any way. The Coffee is very nice too lol.
6/14/18,3,"The sales side was excellent but ... Sales a very relaxed approach and particularly enjoyed the freedom of a one hour solo test drive.
The admin side very disappointing, my details incorrectly completed, including spelling my name wrongly on car registration docs. The electronic finance documents only work on old Internet Explorer and worst of all could not find my deposit, so took again and after 4 days still waiting return of overpayment. Sorry Inchcape Tunbridge Wells you have let yourself down with the important extras of customer care."
6/13/18,5,Very happy with the service. Picked vehicle up and dropped back all in good time.
6/12/18,4,A very professional service from booking a service through to collection. Staff very courteous and helpful.
6/12/18,5,Excellent customer service throughout the whole process of choosing and purchasing my new car.
6/12/18,5,"Completed pick up and drop off in time that was agreed.
Perfect service."
6/12/18,4,"I’m very happy with my new convertible, it is a delight to drive and greatly improved in many areas, especially in the drive experience, which is far smoother. Peter Smith is a perfect Ambassador for Lind BMW with professionalism always at the forefront."
6/12/18,5,Excellent service given by will and the team at Mini (Sunderland)
6/12/18,4,Really good service always look after you
6/11/18,5,"My experience with Cooper BMW, and in particular Mevin (as Sales Consultant) cannot be faulted. I was in the market for a used BMW and initially registered an interest with Cooper (part of the Inchcape franchise) via Autotrader.

Mevin contacted me within 2 hours and we quickly arranged a test drive. He took time to send a personal video of the car and regularly kept in contacted through to the actual purchase of the vehicle.

Mevin was polite, courteous, friendly, approachable and above all, very honest in his response to any questions I had. By far the most positive customer experience I've had so far when it comes to used car buying!"
6/11/18,5,"Great personal service and after sales service. Friendly and knowledgeable team approach, willing to go the extra mile. Thank you."
6/11/18,5,"This was a routine MOT visit, but Coopers responded to my initial enquiry for the test in a far more positive manner that my local dealer at Harrogate.

Also found the sales team much more responsive when they saw me walking round whilst waiting for the car.

At this stage, I think that I will use Coopers when the next service is due."
6/11/18,5,"Booked my car in with the ever-helpful and knowledgeable Nicole. Super speedy check-in on a Saturday morning, super friendly and smiley staff, (Liz on reception, Lucy on service); Alex/Jamie/Elliot in sales were ace in sorting my courtesy car and my car was finished on time and collected Sunday (Lee in sales was terrific), and again, no hassles. Love going there! Plus I got a great video of the car via technician Nick. Superb as ever and no reason for either of my BMWs to ever go anywhere else."
6/11/18,3,"Poorly organised - lost my original booking, had to chase for over 2 weeks for my quote after paying £60 for a diagnostic, made to wait up to 30 mins without any apology for the delay when dropping off and picking up car. The Audi experience in drift bridge in epsom is far far superior."
6/11/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish!
6/11/18,4,"Quick, and courteous service. For a first service the price of £240 is very expensive for 45 minutes."
6/11/18,5,"I am extremely happy I decided to buy an Audi from Cheshire Oaks. The service was excellent, I felt that the advisors could not do more. They were very clear in there explanations and any issues that arose were promptly and professionally dealt with. First class service, and David Mano in particular was superb."
6/11/18,5,"Excellent service from start to finish, thanks Mark Jeffrey - really enjoying the car!!"
6/11/18,5,All worked perfectly!
6/11/18,5,Very good experience.We didn’t have any problem.I would recommend it.
6/11/18,5,"I am happy to spend some time on writing this review. It is difficult to imagine how I could have been better treated than the exemplary manner in which the sale of my vehicle was handled. It was obvious from all aspects encountered that Inchcape Jaguar , Southampton is a class act in its field, Richard Adams is in my opinion a magnificent advocate for the site, and it is seldom possible to encounter the level of professionalism, inter personal skills and customer focus that made the process an exceptional Customer experience. On performance experienced I would expect Richard to progress rapidly in his chosen field. many, many thanks to him and to Inchcape for making the sale so seamless and enjoyable."
6/11/18,5,"I arrived at the Cobham Garage at the agreed time of 8am. It took just a
couple of minutes to check in at the desk and I was invited to take a seat
and partake of an excellent cup of coffee and either watch the TV or read the morning paper. At 09.35 I was advised that my vehicle (YK16HCU) was
ready and had also been washed. I settled the bill and before leaving I
spoke to Elliott seeking his advice on positioning the front passenger seat.
He was very helpful indeed. Later in the day I received an Email with
a video showing under the car- Well done Cooper Cobham.
I would recommend the company to anyone. Thank you

6/11/18,3,"My BMW 520D went into Coopers BMW Thames Ditton for an MOT on Friday 08/06/18. I collected it the next morning. Minor grumbles - when I climbed into the car I had to pull the passenger seat away from the dashboard, the radio was on (loud) and the car (which had just been brought round from the garage) was parked nose first into a tight space requiring me to reverse out into the on-site traffic. Slightly more annoying - the car had done over 15 miles since I left it in (which I've queried), and I had to go back into the service team and ask them to reset the dashboard service indicator (which still told me I was overdue a service/MOT). Extremely annoying - the nearside front wheel arch was scuffed. It appeared to have grazed another car/SUV with a plastic wheel arch extension. I reported this when I noticed it (at home that afternoon). Although the receptionist was very nice and very apologetic, I am still (Monday 11/06/2018) waiting for an explanation for the mileage and scuff. I have now polished the scuff off, so there is no long term damage. I might now consider taking the car to Cobham for future services. I might even consider buying an Audi A6 in 3-6 months time (can it really be that bad?)........a pity."
6/11/18,5,"Bought a 9 month old Discovery Sport on line through this dealership and drove 200 miles at the weekend to pick it up, and I have to say the service was impeccable throughout. Martin, the salesperson who looked after me is a great ambassador for Inchcape and went out of his way to make sure the deal went through smoothly (including taking and making calls on his day off). Car was pristine when I collected it and everything was explained in detail. Would not hesitate to buy from this company again."
6/11/18,5,"Great service, came in for recall of a part and carried on with my work using the WiFi provided. Complimentary drinks available while you wait in comfortable area. Great service and also cleaned my car which I thought was a lovely touch!"
6/11/18,5,"Wouldn't hesitate to return. Easy booking, pleasant staff and excellent service."
6/11/18,1,"They get one star for how they sold the car - but from the time of receiving my money - things went down hill! I saw my car on-line, called and asked on the availability and the condition and was advised it was very good. This dealer is in Sunderland and I live just south of Peterborough so took there word as didn't want to waste a journey when I'd test driven this model locally, what could go wrong buying from BMW I thought! Due to the distance the saleman Simon Telford offered to deliver the car to secure the sale which I agreed and paid the deposit. Simon called to say the car was back in as it was a demonstrator (didn't say that in the advert on Autotrader!) but he needed to get an alloy repaired which would take 4 days so could delivery on the 31st May to get his sale in before the end of the month! I agreed and made the full payment on receipt of there invoice. Thursday came and I called late morning to check on the ETA of delivery - the wheels were not in yet I was advised. Early afternoon I got a call back; apparently "" the wheel had been delivered with a paint run and they had rejected it, so could now not deliver"". This was school holidays so the family had wasted a day spent at home - frustrating! Simon offered to put this right and deliver to me Saturday morning, he said he would leave at 7am and arrive at 10.30 (not great as needed to cancel a kids event that was arranged, but agreed) No communication from BWM to confirm the delivery on Friday, so assumed all in order. I called Simon at 10.45 Saturday morning to ask where he was only to be told no-one had arrived at 7am to open up as planned and he only left at 8.20am and was now running 1.5hrs late (darn, if we'd have known that at 8am we could have taken our kids to the event after all!) 12.45 I called Simon to ask where he was - stuck in traffic 60 miles away not moving! He called at 1.10pm to advise he was clear and would arrive at 2.10pm but would try and get there sooner than his sat nave was predicting and confirmed he would fuel up (which was in our agreement). He finally arrived at 2.17pm, having forgotten to fuel up and advising a stone had just chipped the windscreen - apologising he said he would sort next week. Sadly I had missed most of my 10wk old daughters first time in a swimming pool that had been long arranged for that afternoon due to the delayed arrival. Whilst frustrated I accepted that Simon would sort this the week following. Due to my need to get to the swimming pool i didnt do a walk around, i trusted BMW, however when I got in to drive it I found that the mileage was 11850 when it had been advertised at 8172!! Then when I was fuelling the car I noticed 2x 10cm scratches on the boot near the filler cap!! Disappointingly again I needed to chase contact from them with no solution bring given. All I was told was things that they could do - never what they had done! I was also missing the Private Plates that Simon had offered to have made up to replace mine from my old car (11th June I am still waiting for them) Friday 8th Simon passed me on to a Michael Bowman BMW Retail Manager and he basically replied to say - I needed to sort the problems myself - they would pay £65 for fuel, put the windscreen through my insurer and they would pay £25 admin, the delays in delivery these things happen. I was shocked by the lack of service and contempt! I rejected the offer and asked to speak on Monday 11th, to his credit he called at 8.30am, however he didn't want to listen, talking over me until I got upset by this and asked him to stop and listen - he advised he would need to pass it to a different manager Tim Bowman Used Car Sales Manager. He's basically dismissed me as well. He has emailed to say ""the chip is within BMW Approved Used tolerance"" so sort with my insurer ""You can take your car to a local BMW dealer and have them contact me as to doing a SMART repair to the scratch"" so again I have to be inconvenienced and pay for the fuel to take my car to be assessed and then back in to be repaired, he's finally agreed to pay ""£45 per 1000 miles"" for the increase in mileage on the car, his answer regarding all my wasted time waiting and back and forth to get this corrected ""We will not be sending money as compensation""

I bought BMW for the service and comfort of knowing I would be dealt with correctly. I am now left feeling sour and bitter by the whole event."
6/11/18,5,"We found joe very helpful and informative, and guided us very well in choosing the right car for us. Excellent service."
6/11/18,3,"After having collected my car at approximately 11.00hrs on 07/06 2018 I noticed that the milometer reading shown on the vehicle inspection sheet was incorrect (half of what it actually was). I contacted the dealership but was unable to speak to the service reception as all the phones were busy. A helpful young lady on the main switchboard took my details and said she would email them on and I would receive a return phone call. A couple of hours passed and I had not received any calls. I phoned again and spoke to the helpful young lady who again tried to put me through to the service department without any luck ,I explained that I had not received any calls and she said that she would email the manager of the reception team to contact me. I did not receive any calls during the remainder of that day. The following day I contacted the dealership for the third time and the helpful young lady finely managed to get me through to the service department where I was able to explain the original problem. The person apologised for the mistake and said that she would get the inspection sheet corrected and sent out to me. Here I am on the 11/06/2018 still waiting for the corrected inspection sheet. This is my 1st visit to Cooper Chelmsford Service department and the impression I have regarding communication is not one I would expect from a leading BMW dealership ."
6/11/18,3,"It was okay, average at best. The courtesy car I was given could've done with a bit of a clean and as nice as it was it was twice the size of mine which was a bit scary to drive and park. I had to phone them up myself to check if my car is ready to collect and by the time I managed to reach someone at reception it was past 6pm, same thing happened last time.
When I dropped the car it was fairly clean and it looked that they've attempted to hoover but it wasn't really done very well, just felt like someone rushed over it rather than do it properly. I suppose customers just have a little higher expectation when they pay for BMW service and receive a Vauxhall experience."
6/11/18,3,"My visit on 8th June did not go quite to plan. I was telephoned the day before and asked to bring my car in earlier than the appt time due to the work needed taking longer than anticipated.

Dropped car at 2pm and went to do some shopping came back an hour later and my car had not moved. Was advised that 8 technicians were off. The car was fixed but their was a long wait.

Why not phone and cancel the appointment and re-arrange for another date. I lost 2 hours pay from work.

Not happy"
6/11/18,1,"The BMW Cooper Teesside Experience
A cautionary tale of tyre troubles.

It is with regret that i write this post. After hearing about some rather unfortunate events with the services department at Cooper Teesside and on the advise of my friends to get an Audi instead, I nevertheless decided in 2016 to go ahead and buy a brand new 2 series BMW from this garage. I guess I just liked the car and didn’t think that poor service would happen to me. It never does happen to you, well until it does happen...

Everything seemed to have gone swimmingly for the first 2 years and I never really bothered the Cooper Teesside sales team. I thought that I had everything I needed in that I bought a Minor Damage pack, Alloy wheel protection insurance and Tyre cover as well as run flat tyres.

Trouble really began after i was gifted some metal dust caps which after 4 months use became welded to the valve on the tyre (i highly recommend the reader to stick to plastic dust caps). On removing one of these dust caps and due to the valve and dust cap becoming welded together i unfortunately pulled out the valve and consequently was left with a flat tyre. “Worry not” i thought “ I have tyre cover” and subsequently rang Cooper Teesside to see if they could help me fix things. I handed the car in after discussing over the phone at 2pm on 6/6/18. I never heard anything back all day. The following day I rang and was told that I would get a call back. 24 hours after handing in my car at 2pm on the 7/6/18 i got a call back from the services department. It was not good news or what I was expecting at all.

Unfortunately my “tyre cover does not cover damage to the valve due to use of metal dust caps”. Fair enough I though it was an honest mistake on my part. I asked how much it would cost to fix it as i really needed my car back and i felt a bit annoyed that it took them 24 hours to tell me my tyre cover wouldn’t cover... the tyre.

The sales team member then broke down the cost of fixing my car tyre for me. An eye watering £570+. The cost of fixing was frankly breathtaking. He also advised that I needed another tyre. I questioned why as I have run flats? Were they damaged? His response was that since I had drove on them it needed replacing. I was dubious. To rub salt in the wound there was further bad news. As I had another 3 metal dust caps on he would remove them. He’d apparently be doing me a “favour”.

I decided that this was too much for a what i thought was a simple issue of replacing the valve. Apparently i needed to change the valve, tyre, sensor as well as the dust cap on the other three tyres. I decided to turn down their “expert” advise as something just smelled fishy and wrong.

Now, reader, I am a medical doctor not a mechanic and I don’t claim to know the intricacies of a tyre and the valve sensor etc. However I do use YouTube and google and on searching for similar valve problems the fix was actually pretty simple. You just need to change the valve.

I took my car on the run flat to a local tyre dealer and he took a quick look and said that I just needed a valve to fix it. I brought this for £20 from the sales department at cooper Teesside the same day and the fellow at the independent tyre shop replaced it. Joy! No sensor needed, no new tyre needed and to boot he took the other metal caps off for free. This cost me £40 all in. More then 10x cheaper then my BMW garage.

I’m not really one for writing such things down but I will call out dishonesty when I see it. I put it to cooper Teesside that they were either Dishonest in their dealings with me which is frankly disturbing from such a company as BMW or they were Inept in their dealings. Perhaps they were both inept and dishonest? Regardless they really need to think about their integrity and customer service.

Can you please clarify for me as to what happened? If a Dr misdiagnosed something to the extent that cooper Teesside did with my tyre woes he/she would probably be struck off the medical register.

I look forward to your reply."
6/11/18,5,"Great communication with no hassle!
Highly recommend!"
6/11/18,4,"Pre-booked visit for a recall that has recently been announced. Work carried out while I waited and car washed and cleaned as well, which was a bonus.
Kept updated before the visit that everything was in hand to complete the work."
6/11/18,5,Excellent customer service from Liam. Great courtesy lift to and back from city centre from Martin who was a pleasure to speak to. Regarding service of car everything was handled smoothly and everything was pointed out to me regarding small issue with water jet on windscreen. Right from the start to finish everything was handled professionally. Thanks all
6/11/18,1,"Requested to book in for a service online and heard nothing back.
I eventually booked over the phone and didn’t receive a confirmation email.
Service went fine, average exterior wash.
Then when I came to pay they asked for £240 even though it shows £115 on mini service specifically for my car. According to the nice lady on the desk the franchise/owner adds on £125!? For oil and a micro filter, I don’t think so. They discounted it to £129 which was the lowest they could go. Word of warning check the mini/bmw website before taking your car for service here. Robbing b******s.
I won’t be going back to say the least"
6/11/18,3,"I arrived a few minutes before 8am, clearly before anyone was due to start work, I understand that this might have caused some consternation, however 10 minutes later I was dealt with and left my keys with the service guy. I had to phone myself several hours later for an update, to be told my car was ready. Generally when I have taken my company car for a service as well as having the various elements checked and dealt with I have also been given direct advice on what to be aware of, it seems to me that because my company use different suppliers for the procurement of new tyres etc that your company deems it relatively unimportant to point out any potential issues which I might need to deal with in the near to medium term future. One last thing, the car had clearly been hoovered, and I do appreciate that, however Volkswagen/Mercedes who I have had my previous two cars with both do tend to go that extra little mile and do a proper valet of the car which I always think shows a lot of appreciation for customers."
6/11/18,1,"Staff I spoke to were lovely and very helpful. However, I’m very unimpressed with the work carried out on my car and have had to re book to take the car in again after two days. Issue with stop/start function not working was not resolved - despite being told it was now working fine it did not work on my drive home from the garage and has only worked on one occasion since. Also a new problem has occurred since I took it to the garage with the car veering over to the left. Not what I expect from Mercedes."
6/11/18,5,"Slick efficient and courteous. Love your new Drive in service arrangement, how all car servicing should be"
6/11/18,5,They treat you like royalty Stacie was superb at looking after me I have a few health problems but her help can not be faulted
6/10/18,1,"Appalling salesman at Thames Ditton today. Although the car we wanted to test drive was sitting in the front- it was all too much trouble for him. He couldn’t be bothered to
let us test drive the vehicle - coming up with a raft of bogus excuses. My daughter and I had arrived enthusiastic but left fuming. AVOID"
6/10/18,3,"Service of my car was completed to my satisfaction. However the condition of the courtesy car was very disappointing.
The interior had not been cleaned and the boot was disgusting, being absolutely covered in dog hairs.
I reported this to the service manager

6/10/18,4,"The waiting times were a bit lengthy and the car could have been cleaner, but I’ve seen worse. Overall I’ll be visiting again for my next service."
6/10/18,5,Good Service; Quicker than expected.
6/10/18,2,"I took my 520 in for a first service to be told there was a recall, I planned to wait for my car expecting it to take no more than 2 hr( I was told this)
4 HR LATER and then told to get my car washed an extra 30 mins .
I Very disappointed as I was sitting in front of the customer charter and I think Coopers broke about 5 of there rules. Rubbish rubbish

PS The girls tried hard but new I was very unhappy. Also nobody explained what was done to my car."
6/9/18,5,Hands on knowledgeable service.
6/9/18,5,"Friendly helpful staff, beautiful courtesy car while mine was in for its saftey recall"
6/9/18,1,"Tried to purchase a car, and leave a deposit. Was told no sales staff were available at 10am and I would receive a return phone call. Then at 4pl I decided to call again, spoke to Patrick and he was going to check 2 things on the car before I left the deposit and “would call me back in 10”, to my disappointment he did not call back. I called again an hour later and was told by Marvin that he had left for the day. He confirmed the car was still availabe so I then asked him if he could check my queries on the car and I would leave him a deposit. He told me it would be best if Patrick called me back in the morning. Again the following morning I did not receive a phone call so I decided to call up and guess what they sold the car!!! I was gonna smacked. Absoloutly disgusting sales tactics. The rep probably sold the car to a friend. I complained to a manager who stated... what do you want me to do?!? In tprobably the rudest manner I have been spoken to! I am not surprised the sales staff are the way they are after speaking to the manager. STAY AWAY from this place. Plenty of Better BMW dealerships all around London with a lot better perks too."
6/9/18,5,"Just picked up my new BMW 1 series. From the first day Adnan helped me get a great deal, was accommodating and gave me a lot of time when I was deciding the right car for me.

On collection day I was regrettably late and he was very understanding and tried to make me feel relaxed and actually enjoy picking up my car.

Adnan who I dealt with throughout is friendly and approachable. Another car sales man (who I am sorry I have forgotten his name) was also approachable and friendly too.

Thanks Adnan.

6/9/18,2,The car went in for several issues. One of which being squeaking brakes. 28 years of driving and 3 Mercedes the garage turn round and tell me I'm not braking hard enough! Hence the squeaking. Funny I'm not the only person it happens to when they drive it. Now since getting the car back the cars infotainment system has started to turn itself off. The start stop still doesn't function well either. Looks like this will be the 3rd and last Mercedes Benz I'll be buying. Thanks for nothing Inchape.
6/9/18,5,"Very good service, especially from Kate Rudd, very knowledge about cars and really understood performance and specs. A1 service"

I hope to stick with Inchcape Toyota for many years. Thanks"

6/8/18,4,good service car picked up from home and returned next day would have been helpful to have courtesy car a promised by booking agent not the garage
6/8/18,3,"Car was not ready when I had been told it would be. Since MOT's are not done on site, it took 7 hrs from when I dropped off car (7:45 am) to when it came back from MOT and the oil change and recall work could start. Not worth having them carry out MOT's until they are done in-house which I understand they are hoping to do."

6/8/18,5,"Efficient,professional and excellent service,as usual
Highly recommend"
6/8/18,3,Decent enough dealership. Customer service wasn't to good. No phone call to say car was ready to be collected. The car showroom could do with cleaning up a bit. All a bit cluttered. The mercedes inchcape in leicester is alot smarter and friendly atmosphere.
6/8/18,5,Excellent service from these guys (thank you Dean) and the car is a dream to drive.
6/8/18,2,"Not great, the only reason I have given 2 stars was for the service from Rebecca and the other lady’s help in the service department, other wise it would be 1 star or zero if it was an option.

At every stage of dealing with inchcape Mercedes-Benz Coventry, it was difficult. Trying to contact via telephone, I can only compare to calling someone on the moon, there is no one there! Once you do manage to book into the service department, do not expect a warm greeting on arrival if you go through the show room. The front of house receptionist(s)
are dreadful, a smile would go a long way, in fact any interaction would be positive step. The only saving grace, was when finally collecting my car from Rebecca who was lovely, and was clearly trying to help. However the service department are clearly under staffed and there needs to be a serious review regarding systems training and dealing with customers in general. Buying a premium brand, you have a certain expectation on service levels, and customer service, unfortunately Coventry Mercedes have a long way to go. Can’t wait for the cut and paste response, see below."
6/8/18,5,good expereance nice service
6/8/18,5,I visited Inchcape Toyota in Burton upon Trent today after suffering a flat tyre. They helped me straight away and went over and above with the level of customer service given. Daniel who helped book me in couldn’t have been more helpful. I will definitely recommend them to my friends.
6/8/18,5,Very good service - so grateful they were able to pick up my car and drop it back on completion. Communication was excellent 😊
6/8/18,5,"Excellent service from professional staff. This was our first visit and I found the team to be knowledgeable, polite and considerate. They were very informative and car was returned in excellent condition. Will definitely return."
6/8/18,5,I find the staff very friendly and my car is ready when promised. The company is very easy to deal with. I actually travel further than my nearest dealer as I prefer to use Coopers.
6/8/18,5,"Excellent service from Inchcape Mercedes-Benz; came to my house picked my car up took it away, serviced and MOT'd my car.
Brought it back valeted!
Couldn't ask for anything else"
6/8/18,4,"It is a pity there is not a section of the car park that is for the service department. Very difficult to park and the women after me was very concerned that she parked on a double yellow line. Saying that negative point once in the building the staff could not have been nicer. I waited for my car in a comfortable lounge upstairs. The coffee machine was out of order there, it as working downstairs, and there were a few magazines to read. I received the Audi Cam even before I left the showroom."
6/8/18,5,Great service experience thanks Mark
6/8/18,4,No problems. Car ready to be collected at the due time.
6/8/18,5,"James, the person we saw made us very welcome . He advised the service should be completed by 1pm and this was the case which we had requested. James was very polite and made sure all questions were answered.
Thanks
Emily"
6/8/18,5,"Excellent customer service, well exceeded my expectations! Also included a free wash/vac and health care check and free drinks while I waited!"
6/8/18,5,"Excellent service. From the immediate welcome as I entered, to the moment I left the building. Great team, excellent service."
6/8/18,3,"No issues with the garage itself, but the booking system is awful. When I booked the system I asked for a car; that wasn't conveyed to the garage so there was no car available. If I hadn't called for a lift I would have been stranded there all day as it's pretty much in the middle of no where. Staff response wasn't helpful; they could pull the call but that would take days... All the while my service would have been delayed."
6/8/18,5,Excellent customer service in a very timely and friendly manner.
6/8/18,5,"Great service from all the team. I had to take my car in for a recall, really nice team in the office, sales guys said hello on the way round which shows great customer care. Thanks again."
6/8/18,5,"Booked through the on line system, highly efficient handover of car for service and pick up of rental vehicle and a comprehensive video / service details electronically delivered - very impressive!"
6/8/18,3,"Left car for service and software update, got a call around one to say work had been completed but car needed to be cleaned so I left it over an hour. On arrival, didn’t seem any order to see customers, after waiting over 30 mins and seeing other people coming in and seen before me I approached the desk and they gave me keys and told car was outside, after all that time my car had not been washed, which was always complimentary on previous visits. Yesterday I had an alarm come up on my dashboard saying I had a problem with ‘cruise control’. Apparently this is a problem after the update"
6/8/18,4,"Purchased a used car from Inchcape Basingstoke. The process was the usual negotiation with them undervaluing my trade in,this is not exclusive to Inchcape unfortunately. I also had to sit through the usual up-sale of various additions again not exclusive to Inchcape and something the whole car industry is guilty of. However that said the salesman was knowledgeable about the car and everyone at the showroom were polite and helpful at all times."
6/7/18,5,"Early morning service, while u wait, a very good experience, will definitely use Inchcape Warrington again."
6/7/18,5,"Really good service. Friendly attentive staff and good facilities in showroom.

Would be nice if for £55 mot you could have given car a quick clean though. Makes the difference between a £30 MOT at non Mercedes garages but otherwise great service."
6/6/18,5,Staff were friendly and inform on time to may the arrangements easy
6/6/18,5,Vehicle was returned clean inside and out. Service took longer than previously estimated but this was not a problem as waiting area is comfortable and well equipped. Part not available which will require an inconvenient return trip.
6/6/18,5,"The service team are always friendly and helpful. Today I was served by Mandy who was great and sorted everything out. The ladies welcoming you on the desk were polite and offered me a coffee. On the way out I had a good chat with Mark the salesman.
It’s a very nice and friendly place to come, keep up the good work guys!"
6/6/18,5,Like New. Kept informed of progress all the way and very pleased with the work and excellent service.
6/6/18,4,"Customer service was good however, a day before was advise no courtesy car. Mini cab took 30 minutes to arrive to take me to work. Apart from this - good service"
6/6/18,5,"Amazing Customer service and care taken on our visit to have my wife's A Class serviced from beginning to end we could not have asked for better. Thank you, Martin & Anne,"
6/6/18,1,"A series of unbelievable errors by the service advisors, not once but on several occasions, no communication between them. Unable or unwilling to return telephone calls and will tell blatant lies in order to cover up the errors and/or oversights they make."
6/6/18,4,Salesperson that sold the car to me was very polite and professional. The only concern was when I collected my car there was a little blemish so I have to take my car back to get it sorted out. Its a little inconvenient. When I asked why the blemish wasn't dealt with before me collecting my car I was told there was not enough time. Overall a good experience apart from the blemish on my vehicle.
6/6/18,5,Excellent service from there service manager. Got me out of a difficult situation in double quick time.Will not hesitate to use them again.
6/6/18,1,Kept me waiting for 1hr for a minor issue which they made a big problem to rip me off. Terrible people least helpful just want money money from you.
6/6/18,1,"I booked my C250 in for a manufacturers safety recall relating to the drivers airbag potentially accidentally triggering whilst driving. My booking was 2 to 3 weeks in advance and I received a reminder phone call the day before. I arrived at 8.15am as arranged to meet the service receptionist who confirmed the parts and work would be completed that day.
Later the same morning I received call from the same receptionist explaining that you didn’t have the parts, THE WORK HADN’T BEEN COMPLETED, I WOULD NEED TO BRING THE CAR IN AGAIN and the only good news was I could collect the vehicle now!!! Unbelievable?"
6/6/18,5,Staff at Cooper Tonbridge always helpful and efficient. Great customer service.
6/6/18,3,"Rang and booked for the recall work to be carried out, and told it would take about an hour and a half. Would I like to wait? I said no as there are no shops etc nearby to pass the time, so agreed I would bring the car in at 9.30 am. The afternoon before I receive a telephone call to confirm Tuesday's booking, and told the car won't be ready until 5pm. Tuesday morning, I drop the car off and am told if it is ready earlier than I will receive a telephone call, otherwise it will be 5pm. Soon after 4pm I am rung to say it will be ready at 5pm. I arrive at about 5.15pm, and finally get the car at 5.45pm, as it was still being chamoised!

All seems fine, and it is certainly lovely and clean both inside and out . The clocks have been re-set as I hadn't bothered to do this, but both say 05:45. Wonder now if in the morning they will read 17:45?"
6/6/18,5,"Was given an appointment reminder and given a realistic time for fixing. The sales manager escorted me to a comfortable seating area and was professional and courteous. Received a health check video from the engineer via email and text - again polite and courteous and easy to understand the checks completed and any existing issues. Was very impressed from start to finish with the staff, their professionalism and their first rate service - thank you for a lovely experience :-)"
6/6/18,1,"I had booked in my E350cdi estate to have the Mercedes Me adaptor fitted (which is currently free of charge and also provides a vehicle health check inspection) and all seemed good as the lady in Service returned my keys, was very polite throughout and advised all complete and nothing to report from the inspection. I also asked for full details of the facilities available on my phone from the adaptor - she said she would email me the details. However, nothing arrived despite a reminder email from me - nothing.
Later the day the adaptor was fitted I did receive an email confirming the Health Check had been completed and linking to a video of the technicians comments plus a report detailing issues identified together with itemised costs to rectify. I was unhappy with the confusing messages so had an independent motor engineer examine my car and specifically look at the items identified. Many of the reported chargeable points were not as stated. So I could have paid out more than £877 for potentially unnecessary work.
In addition the Mercedes Me adaptor had not been linked to my phone - why, because it has to be linked within 3 minutes of installing the adaptor in the car. They never even asked for my mobile phone so it could never be linked.
What a complete waste of my time - it certainly did NOT exceed my expectations in a positive way, but hopefully it will contribute to an improved experience for some other customers.

So PLEASE ignore this offer it is effectively a scam aimed to entice unsuspecting owners to have work undertaken which may not be necessary."
6/6/18,5,"Excellent service extremely helpful, would recommend to anyone."
6/5/18,5,"Just had a second service on my SLC and the customer service was exceptional. Everything was dealt with efficiently completing the service in 2 hours at an allocated time slot. I was very impressed with the Video over view of the service, this was a first for me.
Even the engineer who carried out the service thanked me for using Inchcape on his Video.

Great customer care, well done"
6/5/18,1,"My new ‘E’ series coupe was not ready on the originally agreed date and time.
I then agreed to have the car delivered by Mercedes-Benz Liverpool to my home address the following morning.
When the new car arrived that morning I very quickly realised that the car that Mercedes-Benz Liverpool had delivered was not the car I had signed up for as the interior specification was incorrect.
I am currently waiting for Mercedes-Benz Liverpool to provide me with the car with the correct specification."
6/5/18,5,It's always a pleasure to bring my BMW to Cooper BMW in Chelmsford. The service is excellent every time.
6/5/18,5,"Had MOT, Repair and Service, everything great, if a little expensive as always."
6/5/18,5,"Coopers service Is superb, and the staff friendly, courteous, and efficient."
6/5/18,5,MOT & SERVICE COMPLETED ON TIME WITH A MINIMUM OF FUSS AND A MAXIMUM OF COURTESY - TOP MARKS !
6/5/18,4,"Excellent experience, waited in showroom while service and MOT completed. Very nice working environment. Good communication and attentive customer service delivered by friendly service and reception team.
The only disappointment was the valet (hence 4*s). More like a cursory wash and vac (which did not include boot - which I stupidly emptied beforehand!). Bit of a shame, my usual BMW dealership may have raised my expectations here!"
6/5/18,5,"Great service from the start and friendly staff.

When asked for the car to made available earlier due to my busier week they sorted if for me and had everything ready on collection. Will definitely be recommending to others"
6/5/18,5,Great Service - really looking after us & our John Cooper Countryman ... GREAT.....................
6/5/18,5,"This Dealership is the best we have used in recent years, 5 stars every time, thank you"
6/5/18,4,Colin from the service department was fantastic kept me up dated through out the day. Great service all round..
6/5/18,5,MOT and service. Collected the car from my workplace and delivered back thus saving me a lot of hassle. Checked with me the day before and arrived promptly. Back in time for my return journey home and a given the car a valet.
6/5/18,5,"The customer service I received from Martin Harvey, Sales Consultant at the Derby dealership was excellent."
6/4/18,5,Quality service and facilities
6/4/18,1,"My car was booked in for a brake fluid change and MOT. After waiting half an hour to be seen I was told the loan car that was organised 2 months previously was not available but that someone could drop me home and then they would return my car to my home address later that day. I had no choice but to accept and be without a car all day because the MOT is due. At 5.30pm I hadn't heard from them so called and was told that it was ""just being finished"" and a driver would be returning the car shortly. At 7.30pm there was no sign of it and no answer on the dealership phone line. Its now 10pm and it has not been returned. There is a slogan on the dealership wall saying that they want customers to be ""completely satisfied"" - cancelling loan cars that they require you to book 2 months in advance and then not returning customers actual cars is probably not the best start. What they are very good at is sending you a 3 minute video of the underside of your car telling you about all sorts of things that could do with being replaced - in my case it was 2 front tyres, brake discs and brake wear sensors. Well its just passed its MOT so I think I will decline on all that, but when the time comes to replace these items I will be taking the car elsewhere. That is, of course, if I ever get it back."
6/4/18,5,Great what more can I say !
6/4/18,5,"I recently purchased my car from East Kent Audi. From start to finish the whole experience was made easy, relaxed and simple. I would like to mention Stephen Holmes as this is the guy that made this happen. I am really pleased with my car and would certanly recommend this dealership to anyone considering buying an Audi. Thanks to Steve and the team!"
6/4/18,5,Polite and professional service in all respects from Dave in Service Department. The video was good to see and I also thought this was carried out professionally.
6/4/18,5,Outstanding service in every measurable way. I’ll be back next year 👍
6/4/18,5,"My car had a recall done on the passenger airbag, an MOT and a service on the same day. I dropped my car off at 8am and I was given a curtercey car. My car was ready to be picked up from about 3pm. The staff are absolutely tremendous. They can't do enough for you and nothing is too much trouble. I would recommend Toyota Derby to anyone. My car is now 7 years old and I've only ever had one problem with it and that was the central locking went on the passenger side. It got done and sorted and it's past it's MOT every time so far. So it's an aposolutly tremendous make of car. My car is a yaris T spirit. And I'm very happy with everything."
6/4/18,3,"Booked a service online for a specific time. Then had a text message to say i was booked in an hour later than i wanted. No explanation given on arrival at Audi.

Had to wait for an hour after the confirmed pickup time, was just sat there being ignored for the most part. No a particularly professional after sales service. My time is tight and wasted hours uneccersarily because of Audi."
6/4/18,5,"all handled extremely efficiently
- Scott kept me advised at all times of progress - no surprises
car returned clean and we presented"
6/4/18,4,"Gave me a verbal quote for work on my BMW and when I arrived made clear that's what I'd be charged, and I was. Courtesy car, no problem, minimal admin. Told when job would be done and I could the car up, and it was. Answered my unrelated questions about the car. Good service all round."
6/4/18,2,Was told work being carried out was going to take about 1hr 30mins. I was sat there waiting for 3hr 20mins. No courtesy car offered and considering I lived 30 miles away so a 60 mile round trip I don’t think that’s acceptable. 4 and a half hours of my time wasted and then fuel getting there and back and it’s supposed to be bmw’s Inconvenience not my own.
6/4/18,5,Speedy service while I waited in a comfortable waiting area
6/4/18,5,"Very good . Found the problem and sorted it.
Would recommend"
6/4/18,5,Efficient staff. Friendly. Mini service went well. There was even a deal on for the MOT.
6/4/18,5,"Organisation, pick up & drop off of car at my workplace without incident...the guys were early! Haven't had the same experience with other BMW garages as I have had occasion to allow others to conduct the service work purely through availability & my schedule! Video of inspection was great as always so I could see what the service guys were looking at...no issues thankfully! Car was spotless when they delivered it back. I was embarrassed thinking about how I gave them it! Well done again Inchcape/Cooper Teesside!"
6/4/18,5,Very helpful and caring staff who went out of their way to make the process easy and stress free
6/4/18,5,Received a earlier then scheduled. Car valeted. Very polite staff
6/4/18,5,"Very smooth procedures. Patrick who looked about 12 was excellent, he was knowledable, efficient and polite."
6/4/18,5,"Very happy with the service I have received from BMW, the staff were friendly and happy to help, when I used BMW assist, they provided a courtesy car quickly and resolved the issue quickly and efficiently - I will definitely buy from Inchcape BMW again."
6/4/18,5,Great service when buying our new car
6/4/18,5,Exceptional service with friendly welcoming staff
6/4/18,4,"Booked my MOT a few weeks ago as very popular arrived on time and my car was taken for its inspection and health check service department great!
It would have been five stars if I had received my video link !!"
6/4/18,5,"Excellent service. Polite and helpful service staff. Taxi provided into city while waiting for car. Car ready at time stated. Very pleasant experience and no complaints. All service received from Coopers BMW since purchasing the car last September 2017 has been first class, long may it continue."
6/4/18,3,"Service was completed within the allotted time & car washed accordingly. However, shine taken off (excuse pun) with boot left unhoovered (not particularly dirty), and dashboard top not dustered down a shame as communication & rest of experience great. Thank you"
6/4/18,3,"Audi do not have to try too hard to sell cars, so they should concentrate on making the customer feel valued. The negotiation process was painful, the salesman did not actually listen to what was being said. He failed to provide any documentation or pack for Gardx until asked (and I am not convinced the treatment was actually applied), provided half a tank of petrol instead of the full tank agreed, and provided a wind deflector which does not fit the car. He also pretty much insisted on a 31 May completion (presumably to make his monthly figures. Not a five star performance, but redeemed to an extent by the Dealer Principal, who has been helpful in seeking to resolve the outstanding issues."
6/3/18,4,"Booking my car in was very easy. Waited for it. Chairs in waiting area very hard and uncomfortable, so sat in softer chair in showroom. Car was ready in just over 2 hours, so not too bad."
6/3/18,3,I brought my car into serviceand when I came t collect it was ushered outside as quickly as was possible.The experience isnt quite what it used to be over the years. Previously I have had phone calls to remind me of my service etc this year nothing. Therefore not up to what I have been previously accoustmed to and I have to add this has been my expereince snce January.
6/3/18,4,Helpful and informative staff. Car valeted to high standard after service and work done/required were fully explained
6/3/18,1,"Complaint made to BMW Thames Ditton. Not addressed and not even responded to. Because of that I have forwarded that also to BMW Customer Service and despite automated email back promising contact there is no response at all after a week.
Too many issues to list. New car (7series!) broken on scheduled pick up day, serious Finance agreement errors costing me money and very poor customer service with no one actually bothered to respond. My favourite car manufacturer failed miserably."
6/2/18,1,"I booked my GLA 4matic in to identify and rectify a fault that was causing a loud clunking sound as I dropped down gears and set off, an MOT and resolution of a government recall. My first problem was finding the garage as I had not been informed it was moving and when I eventually arrived the receptionist laughed when I mentioned the problem I had finding the new garage which was not the greeting I expected. I explained to my service rep that I did not need my car until the following day. I heard nothing the first day. I missed a call the following morning and had to ring back four times before I was able to speak to my service rep. She informed me that she needed authorisation to spend a further 2 hrs establishing where the fault was. I agreed to this but stated I needed the car back by the end of the day or at the very latest first thing the following day. I called repeatedly towards the end of the day but could not speak to my service rep and no one else could help me. The following morning I started ringing at 8 am and finally got a call back at 8.45 telling me nothing had been done to my car at all the day before after having it for 2 days and I would have to rebook! I explained that they was the last thing I would do and arranged to collect my car. I will never return to this Mercedes dealership and servicing garage and I have no idea why it has such a high customer rating."
6/2/18,5,The service was brilliant. My wife took our car in for a service. She is 7 months pregnant and they really looked after her. They paid for a cab to a near by high street and were very friendly. Also the service of recording the vehicle health check explaining what was done and texting it to me was great!
6/2/18,1,"ZERO STARS.......Only giving 1 star because I can’t give 0 for the worst Service ever.theyll never call you back when they say they will.5 days in a row I asked for a call back and got nothing.the staff I met are rude lie and are not interested in helping you once they’ve got your order and money.I had an appointment to collect my new car at 1.30pm and was called at 12pm to say they needed to push it back till 4pm.once I got to the dealership at 4pm I was told someone called me and left a message at 3:15pm which they did not to tell me not to come because the car is not available for me. I now have a refund and will be going to a non cooper dealership and logging a complaint with bmw direct.the company is a total waste of time and at one point one of there sales team told me that the recall that has been on the news has affected production of new all new bmw cars which is total rubbish.4 wasted trips of over 20 miles each way to just be fobbed off with lies.i am a motability customer and even motability had there calls dodged by this garage and failed to get a call back in the two days that’s they tried to contact them.i would never recommend this place to anyone I even remotely like.

UPDATE.you could improve by telling your staff to not lie to customers and maybe answer the phone and call people back when you say you will.little things go a long way to building a good reputation with customers for future purchases.You guys give bmw a bad name you were all very helpful until you took my money and order then couldn’t give a Hoot.being under staffed Is no excuses."
6/2/18,5,Excellent and courteous service. You receive personal attention at this place.
6/2/18,5,"A very professional service all-round.
The service reception staff were attentive, despite being clearly very busy. This made the unavoidable wait for the map data to download far more tolerable.
Well done Cooper BMW."
6/2/18,1,"Having been lied to, and my car damaged, the generic reply below was all I got.....you have my details, your garage will know who I am, they could contact me but have a glacial speed of customer service as still unresolved after 4 weeks.

I’d have expected my car to come back better than it went it, not worse. I don’t believe the oil or brake fluid was changed. For this entire situation to be rectified, I would want a complete detail on the car by a company of my choice, not your chaps who meet your low standards and cheap price....which should have been your first point of response.

Good Morning Mr Jones, thank you for taking the time to let us know about your recent experience. We are disappointed to hear that you are not satisfied with your visit. Please contact us at BlahBlahBlah to help us make this right for you."
6/2/18,5,Great service as usual. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Courtesy car available and received a phone call to advise when service completed. My car clean and ready when I returned to the showroom.
6/2/18,5,"Welcoming, friendly, attentive and very professional."
6/1/18,5,"Professional, quick, attentive but not intrusive. Great people."
6/1/18,5,Thanks to Erald Kullolli & team for make our purchase so easy .
6/1/18,3,I waited far too long for my car to be serviced and to take a car to be test driven. I wouldn't have minded if someone came out periodically to keep me updated but instead you are just left and left. It took an hour to sort out the test drive! When my service report was given to me I was told they couldn't find the wheel locking nut.... even though I had told them where it was (and it was written down) when I handed over the keys in the car and then I felt the need to show them after - it was then sitting on the back seat WHERE THEY HAD MOVED IT TO! They also hadn't bother to clear the inside aspect of the car door. incompetence is a word that sprung to mind! It also bugs me when you pay much and it takes so long. I wish I had saved myself half an hour to wait for the cleaning and paid the man down the road a fiver to do it properly. In the end the test drive was good and the sales person was nice to talk to about a potential car.
6/1/18,1,Found a rattling noise after receiving the car back. Took to another garage to have a quick look over and found a bolt had not been put back. Rattling stopped straight away. Also the garage informed us there had been no oil change or air filters cleared. This was done by a family member so there was no payment needed when taken to the second garage. Called Inchcape Stockport to report this and wanted evidence of it being done and never heard back. Will never use this store again.
6/1/18,5,"I like the professional approach of the staff, nothing was a problem and decent coffee too!
Lee Freeman in particular was helpful, approachable and accurate in everything we discussed, closed the deal in an appropriate manner and everyone was happy...
All in all very good, would not hesitate to recommend to my pals.
Love the car!!
George Heron"
6/1/18,5,The service department and the dedicated team who work there can always be relied upon to ensure that you and your vehicle receive the best treatment and service.
6/1/18,1,"No idea in the servicing requirements of the car. Was only offered inspection 1 or inspection 2 as ‘that was what the computer offered’. Simply wanted an oil change, was told if I wanted the micro filter changing it would become a £1200 service....no, that’s an inspection 2 which requires my car overnight for a cold engine prior to clearances. If I didn’t know about such things they’d have happily charged me for a full service they couldn’t complete (incidentally not the first time they have got this wrong, as a friend had the same service farce with their Z4M)

Car was requested not to be washed, it was, but was lied to. They scratched it whilst drying it with a blade, the whole wash & dry was less than 3-4minutes ‘care’...Handy things dashcams. When pointed out they offered to have it machined, by a company that still talks about leathering cars dry!! I think not, shoddy behaviour. No reply to me suggesting this wasn’t a company I wanted touching my car, for me a quality detailer would never even consider a chamois as an acceptable tool for the job.

Even after checking the oil it is still a lot darker than the colour after my own oil changes, so wondering if they even changed the oil or left the same filter in place. After 400 miles oil should still be golden and not dark. I will now need to drop the oil myself as do not trust their mechanics or service department competed the task & no way to prove either way, so will do it for my own and the cars peace of mind.

If you’ve got an older M car, take it to a specialist. Modern dealers aren’t used to these engines these days & specialists will see more of these engines more regularly.

Certainly the last time Cooper BMW see any of our BMWs or Minis. The M will be going to a specialist where it will be looked after properly. 2 of our cars are in warranty, but we will go out of our way to drive to a competitor for both servicing and next car purchases. Advise others to do similar."
6/1/18,3,"Very long wait to be seen by service person.
Once again the promised car wash and vac was not carried out. It is not acceptable to be offered a voucher to use at some time in the future as this means you have to make a special trip to the garage and wait while it is carried out. You can do better BMW."
6/1/18,5,"Audi maidstone was AMAZING and made my experience of buying my car so easy!! My salesman nick was so helpful and got everything sorted so smoothly and the overall service was great thanks to him! Nick was very friendly and found me the perfect car, always available to answer any question and generally really helpful, thank you so much nick"
6/1/18,5,My car got checked after a recall from Toyota. The people were very helpful and I got even a complimentary car wash. I had a very good experience.
6/1/18,5,"I have used Mini centre since I purchased my car 5 years ago. Steph who sold me the car and George both at BMW Mini centre Reading are the most delightful people I have ever met. The know their 'Stuff' but they always treat me not as a customer, but a friend. I love them dearly. Also my car is always SO clean when I get it back. Thank you all at the centre.
PS. Love the video of car being serviced, Tony has a lovely voice."
6/1/18,5,After excellent service car was returned in immaculate clean condition.
6/1/18,4,"helpful team with minimal pressure to buy.
excellent delivery
recommended"
6/1/18,4,"It was my wife's B200 that went in for a safety recall Check though the booking confirmation letter and indeed this e-mail, was addressed to me and this does irritate my wife somewhat especially as she had booked the car in initially.

Other than that the service we received was entirely satisfactory, though as ever, trying to find a parking space at Inchape MB Nottingham is always difficult to say the least."
6/1/18,5,Good customer experience will defiantly buy my next car from these guys
6/1/18,5,Excellent throughout and absolutely brilliant customer service from start to finish.
6/1/18,5,They were on the ball at every step
6/1/18,3,"I’ve only given 3 stars because of the delay in preparing the invoice, the hand amendment on the invoice and the free wash and valet service was not very good, lots of streaks. Can only hope the heath check was carried out better...

The experience was not as good as it used to be."
6/1/18,5,Good reception. Alex. Brookes efficient knew the product was able to answer all queries. I felt confident that the car suggested would fit my requirements. So far this has proven to be true.
6/1/18,4,Good service friendly staff and a nice area to wait. I was told it would take an hour but it took about an hour and twenty. Also received a vehicle health check I'm not sure this is necessary when the vehicle was in for an MB recall just smacks of wanting you to spend some money
6/1/18,5,Everything was excellent with the A4 service on 30 May 2018
6/1/18,5,Everything sorted ok car checked and returned very clean and looked after well
6/1/18,5,Warranty work carried out with no fuss. Polite staff & good courtesy car although the fuel was very low on collection
6/1/18,5,Excellent service from initial enquiry to delivery
6/1/18,5,Good service and friendly staff keep you 8nformed every step of the way.
6/1/18,1,Worst mechanics ever they quoted me £1300 pounds to change compressor and receiver/drier just to find out the problem was something else.....Horrible experience
6/1/18,5,"My car had a recall for the air bag this week. It was very efficiently and professionally done.

I was notified by text with a video of exactly what they did and what may be needed in the future. The car came back beautifully valeted. A first class service thank you."
6/1/18,5,I am really impressed by the high level of customer service when I booked my Mini in for the first service. Arranging the service by phone went very smoothly and the very polite representative I spoke to couldn't have been more helpful. I was offered a free home collection which made everything so easy and the driver was punctual and friendly. There was an informative video sent about the service and a clear account of all the work carried out presented in a small folder. My car was returned looking brand new. Very impressive.
6/1/18,5,Excellent service!
6/1/18,4,V.Good customer service
6/1/18,5,"Initially some communication glitches but overall fantastic service, the level of service, minimum hassle, very caring people.
I would say one of the best car buying experience"
5/31/18,3,"Good staff.
Shocked at the fact show room doors are open before 8 and staff chatting at desk was then told we don’t open till 8 take a seat"
5/31/18,5,First class service
5/31/18,4,Vehicle repair carried out on the day and within the time as promised
5/31/18,5,"I am so impressed with the the way Tony Kelly has helped me throughout the journey of purchasing a brand new car. He couldn’t have done any better. He has done an amazing job and has been cooperative throughout and kept me updated with everything. I didn’t know anything about cars, he made me feel comfortable and explained everything thoroughly and sorted out a great deal for me. He is such a lovely and friendly man to speak to and makes things so simple to understand. The fact that he was excited to hand over my car more than me, you very hardly get that nowadays and I really do appreciate all this effort that he has put in. The day I went to collect my car Tony spent the time making sure I fully understand everything and showed me everything in the car how everything works, I wasn’t just left with a car and not know anything about it. He also set everything up for me beforehand. I’m someone who doesn’t really leave reviews and writing this much the most I would do is rate the service whenever I get survey emails, but Tony really deserves it. Overall, I would highly recommend Mercedes Warrington as they provide great service. And ask for Tony Kelly 😁"
5/31/18,5,Experienced operatives delivered he goods as required. No problem returning.
5/31/18,5,"Sales Service level was amazingly attentive, from initial vehicle specification discussions, to driving off the forecourt. Can't praise them highly enough."
5/31/18,5,"Great experience again when buying another car, clear explanation of all my options, with no pressure"
5/31/18,1,"Took car in for MOT, tyre change and investigation into whiring sound at rear. Any local garage could have competently done the first two, but thought I would go especially for the investigation even though Maidstone Audi is 15 miles away from me. They are the Audi experts right?

First problem: massively late, dropped car off at 0930, was told ""car done by 1600, washed by 1700"". Got there 1655, car was apparently ""just going through MOT now"". An hour later, I finally get seen (MOT emissions timestamp 1737, so most likely started after I arrived having had it the entire day).

Second problem: adviser reels off what was done and presents card machine. Wait. What about the investigation? Panic'ed, clueless look. Erm, erm, let me go and check with the technician. Back in 30 seconds, ""the technician road tested it and says it is tyre noise. should be better after the tyre change"". Me: Tyre noise? but the noise is at the rear. The front tyres were changed. (...........) Ah, erm, yes...., well keep an eye on that noise (?) and let us know [ fault description included explanation the noise has been getting progressively worse over 2 years ]. £60 agreed charge for the ""investigation"" curiously absent from the bill from the start. Car mileage same. Seat completely unadjusted and I am 5""4, so my position suits approximately nobody. Doesn't take a genius to figure out nothing at all was done here, and worse I waited 70 minutes for the privilege of being lied to about it."
5/31/18,3,"Waited over an hour to get my keys taken from me once arriving to drop car off. Car was made available at the end of the day, following myself chasing - thought car may have got a wash."
5/30/18,3,"A great initial experience with a new car sales person over a number of visits but unfortunately when it became clear that a used (6 month old) car was a better deal for me I was told I'd have to switch to a used car sales person.

Although I complained that I wanted to continue to deal with the initial person, and they did this to some extent, I ended up having to deal with 2 people (both sales people were very nice and approachable I just didn't like be passed around as if the dealerships needs were more important than mine)

Now I have the car I've noticed a few broken bits of internal trim which is a shame considering the car had been off the road for a few months before I purchased it, and it's now going to take over 3 weeks before they can look at getting these bits fixed!"
5/30/18,5,"Good customer services, Holly was very efficient in getting my new rubber mats delivered to me when they had to be ordered so were not available when I visited the garage."
5/30/18,3,With new move to a larger premises Inchcape has lost its personal touch.It is like market place.Not welcoming
5/30/18,1,"Very disappointed as put my car in for a sat nav update but when I went to use it I couldn’t as it had not been fully downloaded. No idea why this was not spotted by the guy who delivered my car back to me. It’s the second time it’s happened as after the last service it was returned saying it still needed a service!
No joy when I rang and complained."
5/30/18,3,the 1 hour service while you wait is actually 1 hour 45 mins :(
5/30/18,5,Painless experience and can recommend the team there. Made the whole process simple and was treated as a customer and not just as an upsell opportunity.
5/30/18,4,"I was fairly happy with the service of Ricky my assigned car dealer. He is knowledgeable and easy to talk too. I am greatful that he did everything to help me get me the car of my choice.

The only slight downside was that there where a couple of things missing from the car when I drove the car away that if I had known and if he had told me would have told was missing would have made me feel better. These where the following,
1. The missing remote control for the dvd.
2. Missing passenger floor mat
3. The phone system in the vehicle is not compatible with the new smartphones (to be fair he may have mentioned).

Overall though I would recommend Ricky and Coopers to my friends and colleagues. For his help and service provided in getting my vehicle of choice. Thanks Ricky 👍🏾"
5/30/18,2,"The car was late in delivery, after sales has been zero and still waiting for a call to ask how everything has been (salesman was on leave when I picked up the car so I would expect a call once back off leave). Used car came with no car mats which I expected the car would have a cheap set as standard or at least be told no car mats are fitted. I won’t be going back to the dealer in the future."
5/30/18,5,"i Would like to say thank you for the kindest, friendly and swift attitude that staff at Audi swindon had when purchasing my car. a special thank you Erald who explained everything about the car and all benefits that Audi can provide. I have and will continue to recommend Audi Swindon to friends, family and share my lovely experience that I had."
5/30/18,5,Receptionist was friendly and helpful and pointed me to the person responsible for the service. In turn she was efficient and helpful. Service completed on time thank you. Some confusion over the paperwork for the service package but sorted out efficiently
5/30/18,2,"Staff polite friendly. Poor valeting inside my car, with Service. Shocking charge for CarNet/Appconnect for a car that is in Warranty."
5/30/18,3,"Key programming was quoted at 30mins albeit I was pre advised that download speeds varied and the job therefore could be both faster or slower. I declined the standard vehicle inspection and health check on the basis that I didn't have the time and needed to leave promptly with the kids for a prior appointment.
The job took considerably longer than the quoted 30mins without so much as a progress update. Finally embarrassment was to find the new key had a flat battery - adding a further 5mins and much frustration! Having arrived at 1010, for my appointed slot, I only left after 1130 much to the dismay of my kids who were very late for their party!"
5/29/18,3,"Audi Hyde: A pleasant sales department, with a good selection of cars located in a busy dealership and I purchased an approved used Audi not available locally at the time.
When the car developed a problem that was resolved by my local Audi dealership under warranty, they discovered during their inspection a corroded bracket which they recommended be replaced. The fact that this was discovered within 6 weeks of purchase as well as other issues raised with Hyde Audi suggests that their pre-sale service/inspection process could be considerably improved.
Update to this review :
There has been NO REPLY FROM INCHCAPE to my email sent following Inchcape request for more information !"
5/29/18,5,great service and very helpful staff
5/29/18,5,"Best experience I ever had. The service team was a bit behind the expected schedule and I was about to miss an important business call. The guy who took my appointment offered me a quiet office to have my call. This means going extra mile. Also, this year they had the fantastic idea to film the car inspection and to send me the link to see it. That was unique. I will definitely recommend Cooper Reading Service"
5/29/18,3,"It was another vehicle recall, and then added to that a diagnosis for dashboard warnings was needed. Arrived at 09:00 didn't start on vehicle till afternoon. Fault found by 15:00 but couldn't do it today..... so back home to local garage with easy access and a sensible cost to get the work done."
5/29/18,1,"Usually very satisfied with their service, hence why I keep returning. But on this occasion it was a complete disaster from start to end. Place the car in for its annual services and expect to collect it on the Saturday. On arrival was ask to take a seat only to be informed that they could not hand over the car due to the car technician locking the car key in his tool box. Waited a whole hour for this!! The only thing that the dealership could do was offer a taxi ride home.....when all I need was my car for the weekend!
Was asked to come back on the Monday morning as they had access to the tool box then.
Arrived on Monday morning and you guessed it had to wait another hour to be handed back my own car, keys still in the tool box! Then discovered that the car had not been washed as per the agreed service. Was told I had to return the car for it wash on another day was not going to do that as they might have looked up the key again.

No a single apology offered for staff can only assume it happens a lot.....will possible take my car for service somewhere else next time."
5/29/18,5,"Excellent, cheerful service from Kellie. Impressed they were able to complete some repairs the same day despite not receiving authorisation until 3pm."
5/29/18,5,Excellent customer service throughout. Very impressed.
5/29/18,4,It was the first time but it was really friendly and professional
5/29/18,5,"Mercedes got my car booked in very quickly, they rectified the problem with the dust caps corroding onto the valves on each tyre and replaced them with plastic caps (design fault there Mercedes but now, apparently, recognised!) and they also sorted out the product recall in relation to the airbags. All no charge and staff all extremely pleasant."
5/29/18,4,Everything was excellent until I got my car back. Don't think I'll be have you clean my again it wasn't hovered very well and the wash well Stevie wonder could of done a better job.
5/29/18,4,Moved to the Warrington branch instead of the Liverpool for the routine service and it was a lot better. Well done Warrington branch very professional.
5/29/18,5,Absolutely brilliant customer service from you're BMW garage. Could not do enough for us. Warren Snook amazing. Will definitely be dealing with you again
5/29/18,5,"All Good, service as described."
5/29/18,5,A good experience all round. A job well done.
5/29/18,5,"A very friendly service staff member got me an appointment to have my rear break pads examined as the warning light came on suddenly asking for contact your nearest BMW dealer immediately. A tech mechanic examined them visually & assured me that the car would be safe to drive as there was still plenty of pads remaining until a thorough exam was done. There was a slot created within the week & the issue solved. It was a sensor issue we believed but had the pads changed as well as the sensors, so now back up to spec. I liked the price too!! Thank you BMW Cooper Teesside."
5/28/18,5,"Car serviced at short notice and even dropped/collected me from the office. Brenda in reception is a little star, Stewart in service team also very good. Difficult to fault."
5/28/18,4,"Recent had my MOT for X6 at Cooper Thames Ditton - great service and in and out very quickly so thank you to the fast lane staff. However, I took my car for a service in Jan, paid £700 as they found an issue with my computer, to make up labour hours I was hit with that extortionate fee. The fact I didn’t get asked to complete a survey after says it all. I got a courtesy car which stank of smoke, empty bottles and used tissues - for my MOT I was sent a text to say no courtesy vehicle is available. Imagine making plans for the day an then having to wait. Unacceptable- the service overall has made me re think is it the people of the brand. Either way I’m skepticle about ever getting the car serviced there. They couldn’t even find my service plan which they sold to me. MOT was good but historically they are awful period."
5/28/18,4,Mazda in Oxford did clean my car a lot better than Kidlington Toyota
5/28/18,5,Top rate service no problems
5/28/18,5,From start to finish the service was excellent. We bought a car to surprise our son and Audi especially Joe our salesman went the extra mile to ensure that the surprise was one our son wouldn’t forget.
5/28/18,5,My MOT was carried out quickly and efficiently. The service dept was very busy but I was treated with great courtesy and offered a cup of tea which was appreciated. They are always professional.
5/28/18,5,"Adrian what a brilliant guy couldn’t do enough to get my car out to me even helped polish it

Many thanks all"
5/28/18,5,"Joe Forster gave us excellent service, he went out of his way to help and made buying our car painless, thanks Joe."
5/28/18,5,"Very responsive sales force (Paul), who understood his cars, engines and the options. He explained everything throughout and kept me up to date as my car was being built. He was very patient in explaining how everything worked.
Very pleased with the whole experience."
5/28/18,5,I always use Cooper Mini Norwich for repairs and services. I have always had fantastic service from them.
5/28/18,5,"Excellent service, I was very well looked after by Ian.
Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to buy a car."
5/28/18,5,"Excellent service, loan car and MOT. An easy experience from start to finish."
5/28/18,5,Excellent service new car delivered on time
5/28/18,5,"Excellent in every way especially the customer service from Michael Hatton
Thank you"
5/28/18,5,Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Kind and gives you lots of offers. Great experience.
5/28/18,5,"First class service from Allan Jones from the minute he introduced himself to me driving away in my new GLC 250. For Ian MacDonald to recognise me from 5-years previous, know the car I bought (wasn't the one I exchanged in this deal) and remember some personal info about me showed just how much mercedes at Birkdale really do live, ""the customer experience"" world class service... amazing car... world class brand...."
5/28/18,5,Excellent service - highly recommended.
5/28/18,5,Good customer service
5/28/18,5,Great services from guys at Mercedes Loughborough.
5/28/18,5,Work completed on time. Happy with the process
5/28/18,3,"This was an interim service and while Volkswagen normally do a good job at servicing and vehicle check video was useful it’s expensive for what I got which was in effect an oil and filter change. They promised to valet the vehicle and the front carpets were spotless however head rests, seats and rear carpet were poor and dashboard untouched -still covered in dust. I remember a time when VW would showroom valet your car and considering the cost of the service I’d kind of prefer a decent valet service. The last time I went there I’d forgotten but I had the same issue. The driver who collected me however was helpful and friendly as I have a disability and there were no courtesy cars available."
5/28/18,5,"I purchased a brand new car from Gina Lark at MINI Reading. She was clear, direct, transparent and patient. She helped me to get exactly what I wanted and gave me confidence about making a big purchase, taking lots of time to explain various elements of the car spec to me. I didn't buy from my local dealership, choosing to travel some distance to purchase the car from Gina at Reading which speaks volumes. The paperwork/admin and the actual handover went smoothly, and she and her Business Manager were accommodating and flexible throughout."
5/28/18,5,"Very efficient, on time. Staff were courteous and engaging"
5/28/18,5,Excellent Service at Tetbury Audi.
5/28/18,4,"Was welcomed by Stephen at tunbridge wells Audi for servicing my car on 25/5/2018... really helpful, explained everything, even once the work was done, never pushed me to get any other work done, as it was only advisory... would happily go back and recommend to others... thank you"
5/28/18,5,Good service
5/28/18,4,"Received decent service, but just felt a certain arrogance and lack of urgency"
5/28/18,5,"Absolutely fantastic service from Jake Gladding at Cooper BMW Norwich. Great communication, no silly business over price on the car I chose or the trade in. Only small niggle was taxing the new vehicle but that was a DVLA issue and Jake sorted it out pronto. Follow up messages also spot on, if I were more local I’d say I’d definitely be back, still would absolutely recommend to anyone even remotely close by."
5/28/18,5,Excellent service. A good waiting area with easy access to the WiFi to work whilst I waited. The consultant was professional curteous and delivered a good service. I had problems getting there with the sat nav as the Audi post code takes u somewhere else.
5/28/18,5,"Was looked after from stepping through the door to the end, more than happy with the service"
5/28/18,5,Excellent car. Helpful staff. Would definitely recommend.
5/28/18,5,Totally painless transaction. Dropped the car off at the allotted time and was dealt with immediately. Attendant was courteous and polite and aware of my needs. Was rung during the day to inform me that the service I had booked in for was not necessary and that I only needed a brake fluid change which cost much less than the quoted interim service price. Returned to collect the vehicle at the allotted time and all was ready. Car had been cleaned and vacuumed as well. Perfect.
5/28/18,5,"Very good service. Staff were friendly and very helpful.

I was early for my booked service and the receptionist took care to ensure I was seated comfortably and given a drink of coffee.
The service was conducted promptly and thoroughly and the feedback was explained simply and clearly.
I have no complaints about the service I and my vehicle have received.

Thank you."
5/28/18,4,No problems with the Brake Fluid Service but the valet and wash (£14) was not as thorough as I would have liked.
5/28/18,5,"Great friendly service from initial booking through to completion. I decided to wait and seating area is very comfortable and really well stocked with drinks, time flew by."
5/28/18,2,"i had booked my car in for a MOT. tried to get to served same time but was told someone would call me back. they never did. the i dropped off my car i was surprised to discover that they were not open at 730 am like i had been informed. finally having had no call at all i phoned at circa 3pm , having being 'transferred' a few times and the call having rung off, to me eventually just turning up at garage to collect my car. Terry was most un customer orientated and James was more helpful.
I can see why the phone was ringing out if Terry was supposed to have been answering the phone. Very sub-optimal service"
5/28/18,5,The usual outstanding friendly service that I have come to expect from Cooper BMW in Reading
5/27/18,4,Good service until I went to pick my car up and had to wait 20 minutes to get my keys
5/27/18,4,"Car booked in for Spring check, service and Sat Nov update. Would have been 5/5 but did not receive timely update re when to collect my car. I had to ring a few times as it takes me at least 45 mins to get to Cooper York. I was told car should be ready about 4 but they would ring to confirm. No phone call so when I rang again after 4,30 was told they said it would£ be ready by 4. This is NOT what I was told. Other than that very good and courtesy car excellent."
5/27/18,5,Mark is an absolute pleasure to deal with and made our long journey worth while. Thank you very much.
5/27/18,3,"it was a bit of a strange email affair after the end of warranty check on my car. I was sent a video showing my car suspended in the air and the camera moving around the vehicle. but absolutely no information about what has happened, the result and anything else I may need to know. I have emailed three times now to the customer service person and she has not addressed my query at all but has responded but its been vague on her part. I have waited five days before writing this review in the hope that I would have had a better response from Mini Croydon - but no. The car was washed and cleaned very well so happy with that element of the service."
5/26/18,5,Excellent - exactly as expected
5/26/18,5,"I would like to say how pleased I am with the quality of service we have received during the purchase of our new CT200h
I would like to express my sincere thanks to Andrew and Andy who have been absolutely brilliant. The Sales Executive Andrew was polite and professional throughout and nothing was too much trouble for him

I have had a great deal of experience with purchasing new cars and the Lexus Nottingham experience was the best so far. Thank you so much and I will have no hesitation in recommending Lexus Nottingham to friends and family and anyone else I come across who is looking to purchase a new or used vehicle
I hope this level of service I have experienced will be present for years to come

Thank you
Chris and Ruth Sellars"
5/26/18,5,"I was seen by Gary, Gregg and Kevin. Professional and prompt service from start to finish. I dealt with a few different people but they had received a handover and knew exactly what I was looking for. We didn’t have to go through the same info over and over again. All the employees looked like they enjoyed working there. Warm atmosphere as soon as you walked in. Thank you so much."
5/26/18,2,For the second year running the car came back without the advertised wash and vacuum. When I queried this with Abbie at Cooper BMW Chelmsford I was told that their system showed the car had been vacuumed and washed and this was signed off by the valeted. Well all I can say is that your valerer is eithe incompetant or a liar as the car has been neither washed or valeted. Won’t be going back.
5/26/18,5,Lots of help in choosing only the options we wanted from friendly and professional salesman Asif. We now have exactly the car we want. Top marks!
5/26/18,2,Charged me £92 to fasten a £0.56 bolt!!! Shocking and money grabbing.
5/26/18,5,I found the staff that I dealt with were friendly and helpful and my car was ready at the given time. Well done.
5/26/18,3,"A decent experience overall, but I have learned from previous experience with other manufacturers that it is always best to get a second opinion. I was told a tyre had a nail stuck in it and was not able to be repaired. I decided to check with local tyre fitter; after quite a long wait as they were busy I fully expected to be charged for a new tyre. I was given a bill for £17 and told that it had been a very simple repair job!!

It's all very impressive to be given a video recording etc of the work undertaken at Volkswagen along with 'advice' of what needs to be done - I'd rather have the truth and am disappointed"
5/26/18,5,"Customer of many years I continue to be impressed by service, which this time included the work necessary to comply with two recalls. Efficient and timely and included a lift home after delivery."
5/25/18,5,"Great service, so friendly and personal. I was so impressed.
The whole experience was friendly and hassle free. Linzey is just so good.
Recommended."
5/25/18,5,"Forgot that my MOT was due 😬 joe and Kevin at Toyota Sandhurst booked my car in and managed to get it done ASAP. Excellent service , friendly team , 10/10 from me 👍 J.Mallin"
5/25/18,5,"The sales advisor was excellent, good humoured and extremely helpful, he seemed to understand what we were looking for and advised us on building our car to our satisfaction. We are completely satisfied and would have no second thoughts of retuning to Tom to help and advise us to build another car. Thank Tom and Audi!"
5/25/18,5,Would recommend Audi Macclesfield to anyone. Professional and friendly service from Adrian! Thank you so much - love my Q3!
5/25/18,5,Excellent the whole process was great from beginning till end
5/25/18,5,"I very rarely write reviews, but feel compelled to do so in this case. I can not recommend this place enough. My family have now purchased 2 cars from Inchcape Volkswagen Stockport and would do again. I have always found everybody who works there to be exceptionally helpful, professional and friendly and having shopped around, I can tell you that their prices are very competitive . Every member of the team, from Sales, After Sales Service, right through to the Reception staff, that I have had contact with, have gone over and above what has been required in order to achieve a great outcome for the customer. My particular thanks should go to Rob in Sales, who hunted high and low for the car I wanted (and who changed the car after I’d had it for a week when I realised I needed a bigger engine!) and Ellie in After Sales Service, who arranged repair of paintwork when it got keyed (the paint job was perfect and very cheap and she even got it valeted). The crew were as good with my daughter and her car as they have been with me and mine. It’s nice in this day and age to see a business where people still take pride and pleasure in what they do."
5/25/18,5,"My car was booked in for a service and i have to say the service from start to finish was excellent. from dropping it off to collection, Coopers staff couldn't do enough and were extremely courteous and knowledgeable. Prices were compatible with other local garages, a courtesy car provided f.o.c. along with a friendly warning that my wife would be informed if i went near the Porsche garage. Almost family!"
5/25/18,5,"Usual happy experience with Inchcape.
Problem free, efficient and friendly service."
5/25/18,5,"The booking, checking in of my bmw was seamless and very efficient. The communication from the service team was great, who let me k ow when the car was ready."
5/25/18,3,"I had booked my car with service together with a courtesy car. The night before they called to say no cars had been returned yet, but they could offer me a lift to the station. Upon arrival the Service advisor gave me a different excuse as to why no courtesy cars are available. I asked for a lift to the station and was told no one was available to give a lift. I had to walk to station and it started to rain, so not pleased."
5/25/18,5,Excellent customer service. Brilliant work with car servicing. The video of my car's health check was very impressive and enlightening. I felt that the service was delivered with excellence and honesty. Will highly recommend to friends and family.
5/25/18,5,Bought my first Audi from Joe Forster at East Kent Audi and I am delighted with my car. Excellent service from Joe and very pleasant staff in dealership. Great experience all round. - thanks!
5/25/18,5,Excellent service and staff are so helpful and friendly
5/25/18,5,"I have used Mercedes-Benz of Cheshire Oaks for a couple of years now and the service has been excellent! Servicing, MOT and car collection/return without issue."
5/25/18,3,Average. Made me wait 1h longer because they were understaffed.
5/25/18,5,Very helpful staff at the Banstead Cooper garage. Kept me in touch with the servicing of my car. Took exactly the time they estimated (I have never forgotten when the Croydon Cooper garage took 3 days to change a light bulb and never rang to up date me on progress - or lack of!) Returned my car in a gleaming condition.
5/25/18,4,"Booking the car in for a service was easy. The staff were courteous and phoned when the car was ready to collect. Disappointed that I had to phone twice for information related to Service Care Plan.
Mercedes service I find too expensive, but they have got a captured market in Leicester!"
5/25/18,5,"Excellent service from everyone I encountered at inchcape Stockport, our main point of contact Rob was great when answering any questions I had and explaining the finance."
5/25/18,5,"You hear of the 'hard sell' sometimes when it comes to buying cars, let me assure you my experience in Audi Hyde was anything but. The whole experience was a pleasurable one, sound advice, fair compromise and an excellent deal. Sam Cookson showed great professionalism and always kept us informed every step of the way. I feel confident with the purchase and know where i'll be coming back when it is time to change, thankyou Audi Hyde and more importantly, thankyou Sam."
5/25/18,5,Excellent customer care! Even arranged transport to and from Canterbury whilst my car was being serviced.
5/25/18,3,"I’m probably just old school, but why do garages (I won’t call them service centres or whatever contrived name someone in Marketing has dreamed up) think that I need a receptionist to tell me “x will be looking after you today , she’s busy right now , please take a seat, can I get you a coffee. Etc etc” then I’m summoned by the booking in girl who shouts my name across the showroom. If the service check in area has a sign above it, I can find it. If there’s a queue I will wait (I’m English, I know how to queue!) I don’t need some sort of part hotel part doctors surgery front of house nonsense.
All I really want is for the 90 mins hang around until it’s done service to take 90 mins or less, not more. If it’s going to take longer I would book it in and get a loan car. I’m not interested in your work load due to recalls, especially when I can see my car doesn’t move from the car park into the workshop for 20 mins and the mechanics are outside chatting in the sun.
Oh and PLEASE when you send me a text reminding me of my next booking DO include details of the TIME of the booking, not just the date!
Nice coffee though and the sofas comfy."
5/24/18,3,"My car was booked in for 10.30 am. It was for an MOT and a recall. It was planned that I would wait while it was done, but decided to leave the car with them as I had to be elsewhere at 12.00 and it was unlikely that the work would be completed by then. When i returned to the garage at 3.35, I was told that I had to wait for the certificate to be printed off. At 3.55 I received the paperwork, but was then told the car had not yet been washed and would be up to another hour as there was other cars to be done first. At that point I said to forget the wash as wanted go home. I was disappointed that after having the car from 10.30 which was when they booked it in for, that they hadn't got the car ready to go over 5 hours later."
5/24/18,5,Great customer service.
5/24/18,5,"Excellent service, really helpful and nothing too much trouble."
5/24/18,4,"Very helpful, polite staff.
Service was completed in time, thank you"
5/24/18,3,"Waiting area was nice with a choice of free tea or coffee, however, 2 hours to get an MOT done in the fist appointment of the day was excessive..."
5/24/18,4,Great service and wonderful cars on display
5/24/18,5,"From the outset the service was honest, knowledgeable and genuine. With an unusual specification requirement the New Car Sales Executive was extremely helpful in either providing instant answers or finding the answers and responding to my numerous emails. Having completed the purchase my constant chasing for updated clarification on specification or delivery was met with courtesy. Towards the nearing delivery date and my needs and wants things slipped through the net which slightly took the shine off a wonderful experience. Would I recommend Coopers Colchester - simply put YES"
5/24/18,5,Very helpful and fair. No work needed doing and they didn’t charge!
5/24/18,5,Very good service - they also did a free car valet
5/24/18,4,Exceptionally professional and efficient service. Car effectively serviced and valeted and courtesy car process very straightforward. Thank you.
5/24/18,5,"I recently bought an Audi from Stockport Audi and I can honestly say it was one of the best and smoothest car purchases I have ever made.
Nick and Geoff were both great to deal with and I can't praise them enough.
I will definitely be a returning customer when the time comes.
Highly recommended."
5/24/18,5,"Very efficient customer service advisors,very helpful polite and professional"
5/24/18,5,"Both Lee and Dane were an absolute pleasure to deal with. They were helpful, patient and completely professional throughout the entire process of buying my car. From explaining how my wing mirrors worked to calling up to check I was happy with the car, I felt looked after at every turn. I would happily and definitely recommend the Audi Inchcape team to other customers."
5/24/18,5,Ask for Sam - excellent service
5/24/18,5,kept well informed during progress of vehicle service visit and service advisor drove the car back to the front entrance when i was collecting it and wound down the windows to help cool it down.... one of the better experiences in my many years of dealing with volkswagen and inchcape.
5/24/18,3,"Service to my bmw is good , the only issue was I was left waiting for an hour due to enterprise car hire forgetting to collect me by the looks of things, I had to remind a bmw who apologised"
5/24/18,5,Great service love the health check video
5/24/18,5,Everything run smoothly and easy
5/24/18,5,My first experience in dealing with Inchcape for Service and MOT. I was dealt with very professionally and informed of all matters concerning the car. The video afterwards was a rather unique surprise and I now know what the underneath of the car looks like!
5/24/18,3,"The initial contact with Inchcape was a frustrating experience. The phone wasn't answered after numerous attempts and when i did get through i felt like it was too much trouble for the receptionist to have answered. My recall appointment was made and to be fair I had to rearrange the original appointment, which they were understanding of.
My visit was just ok, not of a standard I'd expect of such a high end dealership. I certainly wouldn't consider buying my next mercedes from them. Their customer service certainly needs reviewing."
5/24/18,5,"No problems, easy to deal with"
5/24/18,5,Great service
5/24/18,5,Great 1-2-1 service first class
5/24/18,3,"I booked my vehicle in as a waiting service, I was told it would take half an hour, when I handed my keys to the service adviser, he said it would take one and a half hours, I asked why and said I was told it would be 30 minutes, he said he would see what he could do, but as it was having a service wash it would take longer.... I went for a wonder and received an video email some 30 minuets later, from the technician of a report on my vehicle, saying a few advisories and my vehicle was ready. I went back to the dealership and waited a further hour as my vehicle was in the was Que!!
The final report from the service adviser did match that of the technician, as in he suggested I needed two new front shock absorbers urgently!! this was not picked up by the service adviser.."
5/24/18,5,"Each time I visit Audi Maidstone it’s always a pleasure.... the staff are all friendly and very welcoming.
I went 23rd April for a service and went and waited in the lounge area upstairs where there is free coffee, tea and cold drinks and Wifi .
I drive from Bromley around 40 mins but it’s totally worth it as the service is brilliant!
Thank you to all the staff"
5/24/18,5,Collected new e class & service was first class
5/24/18,5,"Excellent service. Service was done while I waited. 90 minutes and promptly returned. Staff helpful, friendly and polite. Video of my car having its health check very reassuring and personal."
5/24/18,4,Excellent service and no pressure sales tactics
5/24/18,5,Very efficient and helpful service from start to finish.
5/24/18,5,"Lee Craske and Johnny where absolutely amazing, done everything they could do to help, Lee even picked me up so I was able to arrive earlier to fill out forms. I would highly highly recommend! the service is the best service I have received and Lee is a credit to the company as very personable and professional."
5/24/18,4,"Great service buying a new car, would of liked more demonstration on what switch does what, but overall very good ."
5/24/18,5,Amazing Service! Well looked after.
5/23/18,5,Great Service! James was extremely helpful in dealing with my car service and other items which needed addressing. Thanks once again!
5/23/18,3,"Took quite sometime deciding over a nearly new SUV and decided on X1. However the shine has somewhat been taken away from the experience as we don’t think we have had a fair deal with the very overpriced Guardx paint protection (£525) and other not so important issues. Guardx was also just added to order and we weren't given an option to remove which was disappointing.
Would also have expected the car to have a full valet/clean prior to handover and especially before guardx was applied. Got home and on checking around car there are definitely areas of the car that have not been cleaned. Wheels on closer inspection are filthy haven’t been touched since we first viewed last week.
My advice would be to anyone considering paint protection to shop around vehicle detailing companies and you’ll probably get a better job done for half the price.
Not really a person who complains in the moment but I will certainly be more careful next time around and speak up."
5/23/18,5,"A fantastic experience!!!
Wonderful customer service with a seamless part exchange!
Thank you Scott Dixon for a professional and easy purchase of a new Tiguan! We hope you will help us again in three years time!!"
5/23/18,1,"Charged me for a screenwash bottle that was not needed as I topped up sreenwash before service, not only that they never topped it up or left bottle in car of what wasn`t used. Refused to give money back only give me a screenwash bottle that I didn`t want or need.
Not a happy customer, how do I know that what I was charged for on invoice was actually fitted after screenwash saga.
Other customers beware and check invoice on what was fitted as my experience tell you that my trust has gone with Inchcape garage of Chelmsford."
5/23/18,5,Entirely happy with the whole process from initial telephone booking to courteous reception staff and completion of works......thank you.
5/23/18,5,First service here. Very prompt and easy to deal with. Car clean when picked up. Very easy.
5/23/18,5,"Very helpful, excellent customer service and very Good communications. Fills me with confidence and would recommend to anyone."
5/23/18,5,"Exceptional service in every respect. From the minute we walked in the door we had a warm welcome and exceptional service from start to finish.
Having experienced the service of one of their competitors North of the Tyne I was hesitant in my expectations but my fears were allayed as Stephen went out of his way to get us a good deal. There was no sales pressure and he found us the car that suited our needs.
I would highly recommend Coopers BMW, Sunderland to any prospective purchaser."
5/23/18,5,Good personal service. Excellent information and choices no pressure. Good follow up
5/23/18,5,Friendly and helpful. Dealt with promptly and everything clearly explained after my car service.
5/23/18,5,"Great service. Help when I needed it, good communication and the car returned cleaned!"
5/23/18,2,Had a problem with misfiring when accelerating. On arrival at service reception I was advised that this was a recall issue with a valve that affects certain cars. How would I have ever known? Nobody from BMW had been in touch to advise of the problem. Whilst the valve has been replaced and the car is running smoothly there was no apology from BMW for the inconvenience and a day without the car. A sorry would have been nice!
5/23/18,2,"My car was booked in for an MOT & was due to be collected from my home address between 0830-1130. The confirmation email stated a service representative would contact me the day before to confirm collection, which had also been my previous experience of the collection service. I had no call so I contacted Cooper Thames Ditton at approximately 0900 to confirm collection. The staff were helpful, although I was on hold for sometime which was irritating. At 1100 my car had not been collected so I rang again & was placed on hold again. In the end my car was collected approximately 50 mins later than originally stated which was inconvenient & stressful. At no point did any member of staff apologise for my inconvenience. I feel that simply communicating with me regarding delays/timings etc. would have prevented this situation. I will think very carefully about using this service again & will definitely be looking at other servicing options in the future. The customer service at Cooper Thames Ditton could be improved dramatically."
5/23/18,5,Staff are always very pleasant and efficient
5/23/18,5,The team at Lexus Battersea were very good - they identified the problems and applied a good fix. Both office staff and engineers explained everything in a way that was easy to understand and did a good job. Thank you.
5/23/18,2,"Having paid the sticker price for a 16 plate Audi A6 Avant that wouldn’t start outside the dealer, I’m left feeling more than a little frustrated and disappointed.
I have the impression the Sales Staff have a well-rehearsed and smart answer for every situation that deflects the issue, but they don’t really care or get to the root cause, leaving my confidence in the Audi brand and trust in them as a dealer, seriously dented.
The car from Cheshire Oaks Audi was described in the advert as ‘An outstanding car’ and ‘Manufacturer Approved’ so we paid the main dealer price expecting problem fee motoring.
As the car was handed over I found the sat nav was not working so the Sales Exec ran off to fetch the SD card from the safe, returning with a story that when they had tried to fit it, the card had failed, and a new SD card was on order from Germany and he would give me a call in when it arrived ‘In a couple of days’.
Disappointed that I had had to point out the omission of the SD card, nevertheless we were excited at the prospect of the new purchase – until the car flat refused to start on handover right outside the front door of the main dealer
The car was jump started and we were invited to drive off - which I refused, asking for a new battery and the car to be thoroughly checked to understand why the battery had gone flat.
At this Point the Jon Smith the Manager, got involved and did a good job of smoothing things over.
The stock answer to a new battery was it would be ordered from Germany which would take two days. A partial recharge would take four hours, but we opted to leave the car with the dealer another 24 hours to have it fully recharged.
When we collected the car the next day, Jon showed us test results showing the battery was fully recharged and said they thought it most likely the cleaner had left the radio on which had flatted the battery.
This was a little incredulous, ‘How long do you have to leave the radio on to flatten the battery?’ was expertly sidestepped.
My main concern is a low-level drain on the battery which will run down the charge over a long period of time – meaning that I am left at the roadside with a car that won’t start in weeks / months to come.
They tried to say that they had check this but no clarity, and certainly no test results were forthcoming.
So, in the end we drove off with a car in which we had much less than 100% confidence, our faith in Audi brand quality and security seriously undermined.
After a few days, I emailed the Sales Exec enquiring of the SD Sat Nav card.
He was on leave so a call to Jon Smith prompted a call back saying they thought they had found my SD card in the safe. I explained that the I preferred the new 2018 SD Card that had been ordered rather than the original 2016 SD card that had been reported to have a fault.
I was advised that the new SD card was ‘on back order’ and they couldn’t say how long it would take so I should accept the original 2016 card. Again, I have the feeling these are just well rehearsed smart answers to steer you in the direction they want you to go.
So, I ended up with a car that didn’t start outside the garage, with the original battery and original SD card, both of which either failed or were said to have failed.
Having paid the sticker price and with no offer of any compensation of complementary servicing, I’m left feeling more than a little frustrated and disappointed and hence I score the Trustpilot with a low rating.
Overall assessment: - I feel fobbed off with tarnished goods."
5/23/18,4,"Paul, the customer service manager called beforehand, was prompt in coming out on arrival and explained everything in detail as well as answering questions. Time taken was actually a little less than anticipated which was great. Waiting area is very nice and coffee and biscuits are plentiful! I would have given 5 stars, but where they had filled the AdBlue they had overfilled and there was a big 'slick' of it down the side of the car somewhat spoiling the otherwise excellent wash and dry they had provided... Having said that though it was all in all a pleasant and hassle free experience."
5/23/18,5,Excellent. Thank God for warranties
5/23/18,1,"I was told my car was ready at 5pm yesterday. I arrived at 8 am - as agreed - today to collect. It took your team 50 minutes to get the car from the car park. In that time no-one bothered to tell me if, or why, any delay was ocurring. Given I paid £700 for a service, I thought this was pathetically poor."
5/23/18,5,"Although my reason for visiting was simply an MOT, Inchcape went out of their way to be accommodating and helpful. I’d recommend every time."
5/23/18,4,"I was a little perturbed when I was issued with my airbag recall notification & it stated that I should contact my local dealer asap to get my car booked in, like I say perturbed to then find out I would have to wait five / six weeks for part. Anyway was then booked in & told it would take an hour to do, then contacted on the Saturday prior to it going in on the Monday to be told it would take three & half hours to do. Don't get me wrong when I dropped off car staff were pleasant & polite, but I could of done with more notice of the actual time I would of been without my car (would of been good to get correct time it would take when initially booking it in) as I had to rearrange my day at very short notice (take a morning off work)."
5/23/18,5,A really good and informative customer experience 2 years running
5/23/18,5,"After an unusual and frustrating 3 attempts phoning the front desk without any answer - once I managed to get put through to the service department I dealt with Phil Lockhart, so the remainder of the service was extremely smooth and professional.

Phil dealt with my service personally with regular updates and videos of the works inspected.

The handover of the return of my vehicle was efficient.

Overall a very satisfied experience."
5/23/18,5,"Fantastic service offered.
Car service done to perfection and delivered back to me looking and sound great. Just a fantastic service all round with really friendly staff at all points of the experience."
5/23/18,5,"All the staff at Cooper Teesside are really brilliant, very friendly and helpful.Everyone says Hello."
5/23/18,5,Very good service
5/23/18,5,"Very simple transaction indeed, no pushy sales, gave them a specification and a budget and they delivered exactly what I wanted and when I needed it. Would use again."
5/23/18,5,Great experience
5/23/18,1,"Pre-booked my car 3 weeks in advance for a MOT, summer wheel swap and courtesy car. I was called at 8:00am to be told that although I'd booked 3 weeks in advance they didn't have any cars available in their pool. When I arrived at the dealership someone had forgotten to request my wheels out of storage so all they could do was the MOT. My car was however kindly delivered home at the end of the day complete with a nice big scratch!!!

No amount of apologies really make up for this kind of shoddy customer service!!!"
5/23/18,3,"Disappointed this time: whilst the front desk is very professional and organised, the service fell short for once.

My car was booked in for 09:20, I was told to expect a call about the works required and that the car would be ready from 3pm. At 3pm I got a call saying that they hadn't even finished the diagnostics on the car. I therefore had to wait around to collect my car, without it being repaired. They even told me that I should not be driving it but at no point in time was it indicated that the car should be kept overnight nor that they would not attempt a repair. How am I supposed to manage my time around that?

The worst part was that I got a quote of almost £500 (3 hours labour) to replace one wheel bearing which looks like a 30 min job at worst."
5/23/18,4,"As always, very professional and very friendly. It is hard to suggest improvements to such a fantastic overall level of service. Maybe the video they send you could be made with an increase in the dialogue volume as the noise in the workshop makes it a little difficult to hear every word. However, hardly a criticism and I will have no hesitation continuing to use Coopers for my car' service etc."
5/23/18,5,Great staff at cooper BMW! AN ALL GREAT EXPERIENCE with the staff involved with my newcar I’d give them all 10 out 10 very pleasurable and look forward dealing with them again ! Great job .
5/23/18,2,"Bad Customer Service

You purchase one of these cars not just for the 'marketing' fluff, however to enjoy the overall experience. You pay the top dollar to ensure you feel satisfied at the end. This was one of the worse service experiences I've had from a car dealership let alone its a BMW service center.
1. They probably put my car in the workshop when I was suppose to collect it i.e. 4.30 pm
2. Arrived at 4.45 pm, said will take 30 mins to finish
3. 5.30 no sign of it yet
4. 5.45 ok pay money and ready to go (6 is the closing time)
5. The vehicle is not looked after.. the car is dirty from inside, not cleaned, the windows were stained, the dash had oil marks probably more than what I was expecting
6. The guy was so rushed he barely could speak with me for 5 mins in the total time

Escalation made to their manager
a. apologies given
b. workshop trouble
c. will clean it if left the car again
d. given you a free top-up of ad blue (yea whatever)

How do I believe you carried out the work right the one's I've been billed for, if you cannot give a clean car back?!!

Total rubbish. If you want to provide a service provide it right first time, if you are over booked cancel appointments don't just add to it

Disappointed is not to say the least, I've got much better service from VW/ Audi's.

Perfect would've been, we are sorry, here is a complimentary car for the day we will pick and drop and ensure its done properly and returned, why is it so difficult to put a smile to your customers? Ahh.. can't be bothered we are swamped and too busy!!!"
5/23/18,4,"A good experince, but can never work out the coffee machine!!
seriously, an okay wait and evrything explained in good detail.
A nice touch to clean and valet the car,. these little things make a big difference to the customer."
5/23/18,5,"happy to recommend - friendly efficient service, as it has been over the last eleven years."
5/23/18,4,"Very impressed. Service was excellent, and they even uploaded a video of the free visual health check that they performed on my car so I could see exactly what it was they were talking about in the report."
5/23/18,5,"booking in car for mot/service was easy & quick,as was collecting curtesy car.phoned me when it was ready & collection also ok"
5/23/18,5,I used this garage for a major service for my VW Polo and I can say that I am very pleased with the services. My car was collected and dropped off at the time specified and buy welcoming members of staff. I could definitely free the car was running smoother after the service and was pleased to receive a report and video with advisories that planned out what needed to be done over the next 12 months and with costs if I was to do it with them. My car was given a fantastic clean in and out also. Look forward in using them again for my next service.
5/22/18,5,"Great customer service. Service and valeting completed to high standard (short video clip of car was a nice touch). Andy was extremely helpful, will definitely go back to this branch again."
5/22/18,5,"Excellent, friendly and efficient service with no issues."
5/22/18,1,"We started off well at BMW Cooper in Norwich, the sales team were brilliant right until the point of agreeing a deal for the car. The initial price that we had agreed on and told the finance had been accepted was great then two days later we had a call to say that the finance wasn’t agreed and it has been changed to a higher price. We wasn’t happy but wanted the car so agreed.
Within 3 weeks of buying this ‘bmw approved used car’ we had a horrendous squeal coming from the brakes. We done a private investigation of the brakes and the brakes were non genuine parts and broken, so we took it back 6 weeks after purchase only to be told they refuse to look at the brakes.
We were told by the Service Manager that all BMW brakes squeak, it’s just mud in there, there’s nothing wrong and it’s completely safe to drive like that, once we told her we knew there was a mechanical fault in the brake pads she replied ‘oh so you know more than our mechanics do you?’

But they did find £800 worth of faults which we need to pay to get done or they will put an ‘unfit to drive mark’ against the car. Now this was an absolute disgrace! We hit the roof and after hours of arguing they finally decided to fix the faults under the warranty but still wouldn’t touch the brakes. Months and months of arguing to try and get the brakes sorted everyone at Norwich bmw would take our calls and say we needed to speak to someone else who wasn’t in, so every phone call was being avoided and no one would speak to us. They then finally spoke to us and said we need to get bmw assist to take the car to them in Norwich and gave us a number to call to arrange, phoned the number and the response from bmw assist was they are lying to you, we will not help you in this situation you need to arrange a collection with bmw directly. We finally ended up paying to get the car fixed ourselves as we wanted the job done properly.
If I could give any advice to anyone it would be avoid Cooper BMW norwich at all costs, they will be great until they get your money then act like you do not exist. There customer service team are a disgrace to the name! Save yourself a lot of hassle, do not go anywhere near this dreadfully run business.
So if you want a car which has had a so called 145 point check, bmw approved used vehicle but has non genuine faulty parts on the car then this is the place to go!"
5/22/18,5,Relaxed non pushy atmosphere
5/22/18,5,A very slick operation from beginning to end
5/22/18,5,An excellent professional service.
5/22/18,5,"From start to finish a professional experience, nothing was too much trouble. A class outfit delivering a class product."
5/22/18,5,Good friendly service
5/22/18,5,Customer service is very excellent. Made very welcome and definitely will go back.
5/22/18,5,"First time I have dealt with Inchcape Colchester VW and recently ordered two new cars through them .It was first class service from start to finish , most of the praise goes to Richard - excellent salesman , very efficient and never pushy . Nothing was too much trouble and everything went smoothly from start to finish.Top praise to all staff there inc.very pleasant reception staff too."
5/22/18,5,I was greeted and help by a fantastic member of staff who couldn't do enough for me when I was at the dealership. And for all the information and service he provided
5/22/18,3,"Decent and friendly staff, but waiting times to see service staff unacceptable."
5/22/18,5,"They made buying my new car really easy and enjoyable! Had very good knowleadge and felt they were giving me honest opinions and unlike some dealerships I never felt pressured into buying anything ! Spiecial mention to Gareth would helped me from start to finish, keeping me informed and helped me with any questions I had even after I had brought the car !! Would recommend to anyone wanting to buy a new or used Audi"
5/22/18,1,"Bought a nearly new land rover discvoery 25.4.18, then got a slight problem with the boot . Emailed phoned and called in, still waiting for a call back to look at my boot - which may need a 5 min fix phoned and emailed 25.4.18 called in 8.5.18 its now 10.5.18, still waiting, for a call back -reason why they couldnt look at boot when i called in- they couldnt take anyone off another job!!!!! no one in service dept available. terrible ow66 gxd. No one from service was available to book my car in face to face, the salesman spoke to me and priomsed me a call back that day !!! No call arrived .

Actually we werent surprised when we didnt received a a call back, as when we ordered the car we had to call three times in one day to try and find out when the car was arriving from Southampton Inchcape, they have no regard that you need to arrange money transfer and insurance and transport to collect ( they encourage you to sell you own car privtately so there is no trade in)

After complaning online FBook !! They called us back, arranged to bring us a courtesy car and take the car in to look at the boot, they rang to confirm the appointment yesterday 21.5.18 which we thought was rather efficient to get a call.... to look at the brakes???, no we said its the boot!!!. They turned up this morning on time............... without the courtesy car, so we had to send them away. After 4 weeks still not getting anywhere, its a joke . Never again shall we use Inchcape"
5/22/18,5,I would recommend this company to anyone. The service was excellent.
5/22/18,5,"The staff were very helpful, I did not feel that I was under any pressure to buy.
On the day of collection was very easy and seamless experience."
5/22/18,5,"Great service from the team at Swindon Audi, as usual. Complimentary checks, wash and vacuum thrown in, as well as pick up and drop-off. Thank you to all of you!"
5/22/18,5,Good service 👍🏽
5/22/18,5,"Very good service car returned for recall work, car washed and safety check at no cost young lady Ellie on service department very helpful"
5/22/18,4,A good company to deal with. Professional in all aspects during the purchase of our new car.
5/22/18,2,"Called 5 times on Friday to buy a 2015 Audi A3, each time I was told they were busy, no one ever called back as promised.
Dane over the weekend
By late following Monday morning still no return call so I rang again. Got to speak with someone in sales who said he call me back with further info
The following day after not getting the information I required I requested a different sakes person. He apologised for the former stating he was new!
He promised to get back to me with further details.
He returned the call & I paid a deposit subject to further information that he promised to come back to me with
It never happened. I called again he still didn’t have the info, sounded surprised as he had forgotten what I had wanted.
Eventually got the info, had to substantially change & delay my plans to buy the car neatly 1 week later!
Summary overview to date, useless, waiting to see what kind of reception I get when I turn up to collect the £14k+ car"
5/22/18,1,"Inchcape VW Southend couldn’t organise a booze-up in a brewery. Non-existent customer service. Having read other unfavourable reviews I won’t bore you with my recent experience - I’ll cut to the chase and simply say ditto, ditto and ditto. GO ELSEWHERE! This company deserves to go bust. They haven’t got a clue."
5/22/18,5,"The overall experience was really great. The speed of the service, the treatment received, ... Very happy"
5/22/18,1,A “expedited MOT ‘ that was anything but expedited. It ran over time no feedback or updates on progress.Terrible service I use you for all my service and MOT work on my VW it’s the last time for me I will use a local garage in future
5/22/18,4,"It appears that with all the recalls the BMW workshops are overworked and getting an appointment is very difficult and getting through to the Call Centre almost impossible

I had to go in to the garage to get an appointmnet for a Mini Service

Once slotted in the Reception Service staff were 5 *'s and the video excellent. Pity that the recalls are preventing people get appointmnets"
5/22/18,4,"Overall good, but disappointed that dealers still provide courtesy cars with the fuel gauge on empty. Especially when I have to pay extra to use the car,"
5/22/18,4,"Having stopped using Inchcape to service my car due to cost and poor service, I brought a new car with a 2 year service plan so went back to them without great expectations. Thankfully they have got their act together and I was impressed by the efficient way they dealt with my service."
5/22/18,2,Kept waiting for 20 mins whilst staf chatted amongst themselves. Unhelpful when their repairs did not fix the issue.
5/22/18,3,"Disappointed following the use of a courtesy car, I had to top up the fuel having driven just 8 miles.... would not use service again:-("
5/22/18,4,The service provided was excellent. The only small negative was that I was not informed tmhat I required appropriate procedures in place to drive the vehicle that the driver who picked up my car for service had arrived in.If a second car had not been available I would have been house bound.
5/22/18,5,"The drop off process was very professional, the service representative was very friendly. Within an hour of dropping off the car I received a video of the service being carried out. The car was ready fro collection ahead of the agreed pick up time. The car had been cleaned and prepared upon collection."
5/22/18,5,"The team at Hyde Audi was very helpful and didn’t feel rushed, Ask for Pav the sales rep what a lovely guy"
5/21/18,5,Excellent service .Helpful and friendly staff.Would recommend this company to anybody.
5/21/18,3,"I just feel Disappointed with my experience at Bmw durham. The last two years I have felt this. I had my car MOT’d. They were extremely busy, short staffed and seemed like they had booked too many clients in at one time. Don’t get me wrong the staff are very friendly and helpful but they were under a lot of pressure this day. I was seen to by the receptionist and told my service advisor would telephone me once she was free as this would save me sitting waiting for even longer than I had. I dropped my car off at 9 am and by 5pm my car had just Hsbc it’s MOT at 4pm and it was just in the ‘car wash que’. I could not wait any longer for it and asked for it to just be given back to me. This happened last year. How can itvtake so long for an MOT which by the way my car had passed so didn’t even need to stay to have any work done. It’s just as well it passed as I may not have got my car back at all that day."
5/21/18,5,"Great service... from when you walk through the door, lady at reception is a great asset to the business. Simon and Gareth are always very helpful. My car is not the latest Audi model however you’re never made to feel any different!."
5/21/18,3,"Went for an MOT, all done well and good. Service advisor was friendly and efficient. Offered a complimentary wash and vac. Car wasn't vacuumed well at all. In my opinion I don't think they actually washed the car. It could be best described as wiping a cloth over the car. If you are offering a wash and vac then at least do it properly."
5/21/18,2,"Poor response to calls on day of service and unacceptable delays.
Unsatisfactory and unreasonable response to cause of problem with near front headlight, apparently not covered by warranty even though car has done less than 5000 miles!
Still awaiting call from service manager about various issues.
A new problem /pop up message on dash has occurred following service.
Quotation for tyre change was £75 more than subsequent from national tyre company.
Overall very disappointing and unsatisfactory service"
5/21/18,5,"Service all done on time & to cost; great choice of courtesy car; very polite, efficient team handled and car was well valeted. Great all round experience from Audi Canterbury."
5/21/18,5,"Excellent, fast friendly service as always."
5/21/18,5,Once again fabulous service from Chelmsford branch especially James nice and pleasant 😘
5/21/18,5,"Took the vehicle in for a recall, was dealt with in a professional manner. Everyone was polite."
5/21/18,5,"Great, efficient and no nonsense service without the hard sell. Would recommend."
5/21/18,5,Recall handled very well. Took less time than stated.
5/21/18,5,"Excellent as usual
Bought car from Cooper Thames Ditton but switched back service to Cooper Cobham as in the past in order to carry on with your very good service to customers.
Lets hope this carries on.
C.Ballester"
5/21/18,5,"Excellent service very welcoming staff. The sales person we dealt with Neil couldn’t have been more helpful from start to finish.
Would not hesitate to recommend to other.
G.Z"
5/21/18,3,Inadequate checking meant vehicle had to return on further occasion to have sat nav upgrade completed. More annoying as vehicle was kept overnight for a second night to complete this particular work. . Need to do better.
5/21/18,5,Top class service
5/21/18,5,"We have dealt with Inchcape Chester for many years and have always been more than happy with the service we have received from all departments.
We will certainly was them again and recommend them to others."
5/21/18,5,"Fantastic service, kept informed of the service straight after it was done, and the valet was a great bonus"
5/21/18,4,Sry safisfactory
5/21/18,5,Excellent friendly and very helpful
5/21/18,5,"Thanks very much for a very easy purchase Antony was particularly helpful and efficient and made the whole experience fantastic

Many thanks
Bob & gail nolan"
5/21/18,5,Prompt & efficient service.
5/21/18,5,Very friendly & professional staff who had the car ready for me earlier than they said & gave me a lift back home after dropping my car off. I got a video health check of my car which is a nice touch & I would definitely recommend this garage.
5/21/18,5,Dave at Audi in Macclesfield was great to deal with. Transparent about the pricing and benefits of the car and Simon guided us through the finance side quickly and efficiently. Got a great pre-owned Q3 with new mats and boot liner thrown in!
5/21/18,5,"No hard sell.. Extremely helpful.
David Mono our sales assistant was extremely curtious,and very knowledgeable about the vehicle we purchased.
Every aspect of purchasing from Audi Cheshire Oaks was positive and a pleasure to do business with"
5/21/18,5,"Easy to deal with.
On time
Happy with overall experience"
5/21/18,5,Excellent service!
5/21/18,5,"An excellent experience from reception, through communication during service and MOT to final handover of the vehicle. Have used this dealership throughout my Audi ownership and they have always been excellent."
5/21/18,5,"I'd taken the car in for a recall and was greeted, offered a seat, a paper and a coffee, whilst it took place. All very quick and painless, and the dealer checked the car over for any faults. As it turns out one of the front springs had snapped at one end and they provided the quote there and then to replace it."
5/21/18,5,Great service and communication from Mercedes Benz at Southport.
5/21/18,4,"Good service, had a bit of a hick up in beginning but was very happy in end"
5/21/18,5,"Less like a chain dealership, more like a family business. Looking to buy a used car, the whole experience was incredibly professional. Winning service from the sales guy (Toby), very friendly team (we were even loaned a dog lead as we forgot ours), and terrific coffee and cakes. Top marks!"
5/21/18,5,"Very good service , i recommend BMW"
5/21/18,5,"Long time customer of Cooper BMW at York and now Malton, this is my 7th vehicle from them and that says it all really. Top class service whether it is a new vehicle purchase or servicing throughout ownership, cannot fault their commitment to the customer. This latest visit was for an advised recall, everything went like clockwork from booking to hand over, very impressed as usual. The staff are a credit to the dealership and I have no intentions to look elsewhere for my servicing or next BMW other than Cooper Malton."
5/21/18,5,"Car picked up on time, received a call and information about the service providing good communications. Oil service carried out which wasn't required and subsequently was not charged. Car returned early afternoon, no issues and a hassle free experience."
5/21/18,5,Cooper BMW York once again provided a first rate service when I recently booked my car in for its MOT. They managed to fit me in during a very busy period and provided a courtesy car whilst mine was booked in. Great service and great staff which I can highly recommend.
5/21/18,5,"Excellent service, no delay"
5/21/18,4,"Very Happy with the service, especially George from Reading branch is very kind, supportive and helpful.

only disappointment was complimentary car wash was not done."
5/21/18,3,Attended for a repair as part of the product recall. Very quick service. Only complaint is I was given another customers completion documents so had to go back to get the correct ones.
5/21/18,5,"Professional from start to finish with my purchase of the A6 avant , highly recommended"
5/21/18,5,"I recently bought a used Audi A3 from Stockport Audi.

I was very pleased with the customer service I received from Tony Jones. An experienced salesman, Tony took time to explain all the details of the car and was never pushy. He went the extra mile to made sure I was happy with the car before I drove it home, a few hundred miles away!"
5/21/18,3,"I had very good experience during process of buying the BMW. But I will like to make comment on the servicing of the car at a later date which I found not up to the mark with the reputation of a car like BMW. My previous aftercare experiences were reasonable but this time I really felt let-down by BMW.
After the servicing of my car I noted the screen wash is not working properly- not spraying the fluid over the wind screen.I thought they might have forgotten to fill in the screen-wash liquid during the servicing. My job is very busy so tried to ignore it for a month and half as I did not get time to buy the screenwash liquid. Yesterday the sun-light was coming straight through the wind screen, and because of dirt on windscreen I was not able to see properly. I stopped and bought a bottle of drinking water to clean it. This might have been dangerous on motorway. Today I bought the liquid but it appeared that there was some issue with the sprayer. I have to go on long distance drive during weekend, so I felt it was not safe to drive like this. I phoned for an appointment but BMW Norwich could not fit me in for this small job - next appointment was after two weeks, They said that they can see me in two days in the morning but they wanted my car for whole day, without any replaced car. Because of the nature of my job, I could not accept the appointment, but I advised that I can come in the afternoon or can stay there till my car is fixed. But they wanted the car for whole day.
Now I will have to wait till I can find time in my diary that matches with the appointment slots to get this fixed. I believe people buy these expensive cars to have good aftercare especially when there is safety issue. I am really disappointed, but I do not want to take my car to someone else to sort this small work out."
5/20/18,5,"As soon as i arrived into the show room I was greated with a smile. Carl came over to me and was extremely helpful.
The buying of the car was a wonderful experance not pushy at all.
I will recommend Audi Hyde."
5/20/18,5,Great service felt I got a really nice honest car buying experience no hard sell. Loving my new car
5/20/18,4,Thanks to Wes in Nottingham giving me a great buying experience. The modifications needed to my car were dealt with promptly and in a cost efficient way. He was also very helpful by taking me to work when dropped my P/x car off. Overall good service and I would return when the time comes for me to change my car again.
5/19/18,3,"I attended audi as i received an e mail informing me that my service was due.
I booked on line and attended at 1pm on 16th May.
During the meeting with audi representative it became clear my service was not due yet and it was a mistake that i had been contacted.
I was offered a free valet and health check which I was advised would take half an hour. 2 hours later I finally had my car, which had been valeted and given a health check, but I had spent nearly half a day when in fact I didn't need a service at all."
5/19/18,1,Just appalling. Thankfully no longer have a Mercedes and don’t have to ever deal with them again. Lord knows why they’re inviting me to leave a review...
5/19/18,5,"Excellent service from Audi Macclesfield
Glad to go local
Staff were so helpful"
5/19/18,4,Service while you wait booked for 8.45am. Service was 5 stars but sadly too me nearly 30 mins to book car in. Service staff told me to wait in customer area and forgot me! Oh dear .....
5/19/18,2,"Went to buy a used Mercedes from inchcape Liverpool and would not buy a car from them again.
We were initially offered 4 years warranty and 2 years service with the car all included, however when we went to sign we were told we couldn’t have those options included and would have to pay separately.

We were also told that he was putting some sort of protective coating on the car for free but when we got the proposal we found it was going to cost us around another £800!

After we’d sorted all of that mess out we found out the car didn’t have some of the spec on it that we’d requested so we refused that car and had to pick another.

Whilst all this was going on during the numerous visits to sort things out we were left standing round at one point for nearly 40 minutes.

Finally got everything sorted and was told we could pick the car up on the Thursday which then changed to Friday. However on Friday we were told it wouldn’t go through until Monday because the finance wouldn’t go through until then. However the finance company had rung us to say they’d sent the payment through and it was all finalised but inchcape Liverpool hadn’t invoiced or taxed the car so we have to wait until Monday without a car.

I was told to go to an authorised dealer because your paying for that extra price for peace of mind but it seems to have been a big mistake and we haven’t even got the car yet."
5/19/18,2,"1st visit I was told I could collect my car after work at 6pm to only get a phone call at 5:50 telling me they were going home so I couldn't get it till the next morning. Appeared the next morning to be told they 'couldn't find my car'. Sat waiting for 45 minutes which made me late for work.
2nd visit I was sat waiting for a member of staff as again, nobody was as reception. I was told I couldn't have a courtesy car due to my age (even though I was allowed one on my first visit). Had to sit and wait for one of their team to take me to work which again, made me late. Upon collection the car once again had not been cleaned.
3rd and last visit I put my car in for its first MOT. As usual... Nobody there was nobody at reception on or the showroom floor to book me in ( not the best start when I'm having to use my work lunch to be there). Stood waiting for 15 minutes before someone eventually showed up and took the car.
Was told it would be cleaned and hoovered before picking it up - as usual it was clear this hadn't happened as where they had tested my wipers all of the dirt from my window was left dripping down my car.

Over priced for the poor service you receive. Will not be returning unless the work is free."
5/19/18,4,"Good service & friendly staff who were able to fit my car in within 1 week of notice.
Flexible with vehicle drop off & pick ups also helped. Would have given 5 stars but the service assistant was not able to give me a print out of the estimated cost of the works & break down at the drop off.
However the total cost came in under the estimate which was unexpected"
5/18/18,5,My car was serviced on 16th May at Inchcape Wirral. The whole process was smooth and efficient. The staff team were very helpful and courteous. Nothing was too much trouble and I have complete faith VW. I travel from Liverpool as I prefer this dealership.
5/18/18,2,"I had not used Cooper Banstead Mini garage before and am unlikely to do so again. To start off with the website would not accept an online booking for a service despite asking me to input all the details (reg no, mileage, address, contact details etc) several times so I phoned to make an appointment and was asked numerous questions about the car and what needed to be done. On arrival at the garage on the appointed day I was then asked all the same questions again even though the man serving me had all the answers in front of him. The whole process of dropping the car off took over 15 minutes and that was without having to wait. We agreed that the car would be ready by 5pm but I was asked to phone beforehand to check. I was told the garage closed at 5.45. It would take me over 30 minutes to walk there so I phoned at 4.30, a receptionist said she would get someone to call me straight back. No one called. I phoned again at 4.55. I was asked to hold the line. After 8 minutes listening to a recorded message (saying that cooper mini pride themselves on their excellent customer service!) the receptionist came back to say the man in question was on another line. I said that I just needed to know if the car was ready for collection but she couldn't tell me that and asked me to keep waiting. I said I wanted him to call me but was told she would prefer it if I waited, so I did. More recorded info. After a while she came back and said she would put me through to someone else. Another voice then said that there had been no apparent fault with the car and did I want them to keep,it another day to check further. She offered to go and check the car would start, the windows went up and down and the door unlocked. I agreed and she phoned back to say it was all ok so i said I would collect it. It was now 5.35 and as i had been told they shut at 5.45 I had to get someone to drive me to the garage. I now discover their website says they close at 6.
On arrival at 5.44 I had to wait for 5 mins as there was only one person dealing with customers but several other members of staff nearby talking to one a other. The lady being served was also complaining that no one had phoned her back when she had tried to phone to see if her vehicle was ready for collection. When I was called to the desk I was given the paperwork and told that there was a further problem with the car for which I would need to make a separate booking, nothing had been mentioned of this previously.
On returning home I discovered that the service book had not been stamped or completed for the service which had been carried out. All in all an unsatisfactory experience."
5/18/18,5,Efficient service
5/18/18,5,"Great service, booked the lounge service so I could work while the car was being serviced, kept updated and then could see progress on the health check sent while i waited. I believe this dealership whilst a large company feels like an owner managed business, 12m since i bought the car and the service has been excellent. 10/10 from me (and I am a tough marker !)"
5/18/18,5,The staff at Audi are really helpful and kind. Will always help to find what you want.
5/18/18,5,Excellent service when picking up my new car .
5/18/18,5,"Bought new car helpful friendly staff, not pressured into anything I didn’t want"
5/18/18,5,"Very straightforward , kept to schedule and to agreed cost .
communicated everything very effectively."
5/18/18,5,Excellent for Cooper to send a video showing the work it had done and narrated by the mechanic who had completed the work.
5/18/18,5,Very helpful and did not suggest work that was unnecessary. A first class experience.
5/18/18,5,Excellent service. Many thanks.
5/18/18,5,My mini went in for service and mot. She was fetched as promised and returned at the end of the working day clean inside and out. I received a call mid afternoon to say all was fine and I paid by card over phone. Easy.
5/18/18,5,Fabulous experience from start to finish. Extremely pleased with my new car. Service from Rebecca was outstanding.
5/18/18,5,great drop off and pick up service from the mini team
5/18/18,4,"Many Thanks Denise for a warm welcome, prompt service and for the on site catering - the technical problem was not your fault and was in the end corrected - Kind Regards - Vic"
5/18/18,5,"Great service, efficiently dealt with, I would recommend using Inchcape"
5/18/18,4,Just waiting timing is bit longer other then ok
5/18/18,5,I would totally recommend Mini at Cobham. Very professional and helpful from the moment I walked through the door to the moment I drove my new mini off the forecourt. (Managing to stall it😂)
5/18/18,5,"Louise was helpful and kept me up to date at each stage of the process. The car was clean and the inside vacuumed.
Louise also explained about the new driver monitor, how to install it and also about the app to be downloaded.
Please pass on my thanksher."
5/18/18,5,"Just bought another car from Cooper BMW Durham and another good customer experience.
Chris Davies was both patient and informative in helping make the right choice.
Dealerships are only as good as the personnel within them and this is where Durham shades the other BMW dealers in the area.
Would hope all this can continue."
5/18/18,4,"All the work done was to a very good level. The vehicle was in the facility for an interim inspection and for a first MOT test. It was delivered at 09:30 but was not available for collection until 17:00 hours. Although this was not in any way a problem I thought that such an inspection and MOT would be relatively quicker that this. But, I repeat, this was not a problem and is just an observation."
5/18/18,5,Awesome experience but a car from merecedes Benz Cheshire oaks!! Thanks to Lauren for the help and great hand over!!!
5/18/18,5,Excellent customer service! Friendly staffs.
5/18/18,4,"I booked in for a service on my golf. The 'physical' service provided only overran by 20 mins, which is more than acceptable. I got good feedback from the VW garage engineers, which was easy to digest and with clear recommendations.

However, the staff at the Macclesfield VW garage are a little cold. Quite rightly, the receptionist was the most polite with a little smile to boot, so no problems there. Moving on, I got met by an employee, who gave me the impression, that really didn't want to be there...... I mean, deadpan.

I understand that trying to influence people's moods or behaviour is not an easy task. But, at the end of every working day, the VW Macc garage is a service based operation, where customer service underpins the success of your business."
5/18/18,5,The reception and service staff are very competent and able. They really understand the concept of providing a service and have obviously been very well trained. This is all down to good management.
5/18/18,5,"Excellent service as ever. Friendly, polite and efficient staff."
5/18/18,5,"I had my TT service at Cheshire Oaks and fond them to be most helpful.
The lounge upstairs was nice as was the coffee and biscuits."
5/18/18,5,Great service. Hannah was very informative and I’m so happy with my car!
5/18/18,5,First class customer service very knowledgeable and great value
5/18/18,5,"the usual first class service, is what Is expected and given."
5/17/18,5,"Service I had at the Swindon Audi was of excellent customer service, tsking in account what I wanted as s custome. Not pressurising me to make a haste desicion and give me time to think clearly. Rhys the sales man was very friendly and asked what I wanted so that he could help me and show me what cars they had within my budget. Would reccomond friends who are considering in buying a car to use Audi Garage and ask for Rhys as the salesman to help them."
5/17/18,5,I took delivery of my new C Class Mercedes on Wednesday 16th May 2018 and I have to say that the whole process was very professionaly handled by your Sales Executive Martin Tickle who could not have been more helpful.
5/17/18,5,Cooper Teesside Bmw or mini are the best dealerships to go to the staff are friendly and helpful and actually try to save you money
5/17/18,1,I would not use Audi Maidstone again. They are totally incompetent.
5/17/18,3,I was told the interior of my car would be cleaned...very nice I thought and removed almost all rubbish but the odd parking ticket was left and the boot ignored!! Cleaner used overwhelmed the next 24 houurs driving with a fierce smell I found most unpleasant. I know I am complaining about freebie add ons but if you want to know what we really think
5/17/18,2,"I took the car in to have an engine warning light checked out that I had waited to get done after it came on whilst travelling and at the other end of the country. Fortunately in the two weeks or so since the trip the light went off. However I decided it was best to have it checked out. I had also received a safety recall notice and managed to get that booked for the same visit.

When I got to the garage at around 09:00 I let them know the light had gone out and that perhaps all that was needed was to hook up and check the engine on the computer and also clear the safety recall.

Being advised this would only take a short time 40mins to an hour or so I said I would wait instead of taking the loan car and spending 40 mins each way driving home and back.

Three hours later later after having to chase and remind them I had a meeting to get to for 13:00 I got the keys back.

That was annoying but then when I got home and looked in the car boot I found my boot mats scattered and that the boot liner had not been refitted properly and had to refit it properly my self.

This left me wondering if any of the work I had taken the car in to be dealt with add actually been done.

All in all a very poor outcome!"
5/17/18,3,"Extremely slow to get through by phone to the service department. The video clip I was emailed was unhelpful as it wasn't possible to hear the technician clearly; also, the key piece of information I needed to know was whether the fault was covered by my BMW Insured Warranty and this was not mentioned on the video clip. So I had to phone back and wait for 20 minutes to get an answer. Overall, not the greatest service experience I have had from BMW garages."
5/17/18,5,"Pleasant experience at Cooper BMW, Durham. Friendly service and no pressure. Nigel was professional and courteous. Would recommend to anyone."
5/17/18,5,"Absolutely first class service, from the time you walk in to the care and attention given to your car. The technician kept me up to date and sorted all the problems I had, even in my opinion went over and above my expectations to fix my car. The part I required was covered under my warranty from another dealer but merc escalated my case and sorted it free of charge. Was gobsmacked. Excellent."
5/17/18,5,"I've had two service visits to Inchcape Swindon and both have exceeded my expectations,nothing but good to say about the customer service. Very helpful, car finished on time, no waiting to be served, car cleaned, excellent communications, easy parking. Special mention for Jade who sorted a service contract problem very well and with good humour despite my grumpiness. Highly recommended."
5/17/18,3,"Site was over packed with cars upon arriving and was difficult to park. Recall work was done (I think). As no confirmation of this was given, only a standard car ""health"" report. As recall work was for extra earthing, I assume it involved disconnection of battery, as when this was done. The time and date was not restored to the correct values as it was before after the procedure. Not what you expect from a prestige marque!"
5/17/18,5,excellent in every respect
5/17/18,5,"Excellent, quick efficient service

Gary Ternent really helpful in getting me the right car and the right deal."
5/17/18,5,Very quick to get the paperwork done when l dropped my car. Everything explained clearly. Thank you.
5/17/18,5,excellent service
5/17/18,3,"No problem with the work done, but booking online was very misleading. It offered me various times for my MOT and I chose 10:30. I booked in around 10:00 only to be told it would take a whole day in the garage! Why bother giving misleading times in the web site? After i argued that an MOT takes about 20 minutes, they agreed to carry it out within 3 hours. If I had been told this online (or in the subsequent confirmation telephone call) i would have asked for a courtesy car. Instead we kicked our heels for 3 hours."
5/17/18,5,"Great, friendly and efficient service from start to finish. Loved the video clip of my vehicle health check!"
5/17/18,5,"My car needed a service and MOT and was picked up and delivered back to me same day. The price was a as agreed at the time of booking the service and was even cleaned inside and out before it was returned to me
A first class service from Inchcape"
5/17/18,5,"This is the 4th consecutive car we have purchased from Inchcape Toyota Guildford. That alone must tell you something about the service we have received.
From start to finish the staff at the dealership have always made sure that the process is well managed and pleasant.
We picked up my wife's new car yesterday and once again it was a pleasure to deal with Graeme the after sales manager, Tom the sales executive and Ben the sales manager (I think that's his title).
Thanks again for a great experience, oh yes, and an amazing new car. My good lady loves the Yaris Hybrid so brownie points all round for me (until the next time I mess up then it will be back to normal!)☺"
5/17/18,5,"Honest, helpful staff who couldn’t do enough to provide the very best help, advice and assistance in a really friendly manner, especially Gurvinder, Mark and Tim."
5/17/18,5,Trouble free servicing carried out very efficiently by pleasant helpful staff
5/17/18,5,I was very pleased with the service I received. I was advised my brake fluid required changing and also had this done at the time which saved me going back.
5/17/18,5,"Great service, really helpful, highly recommend."
5/17/18,5,Great service! Friendly and efficient staff.
5/17/18,5,"Thanks, excellent service"
5/17/18,5,Very easy to book in for my recall and very quick service.
5/17/18,2,"My car was booked in for an MOT and a couple of additional works. The car was collected between 9-10am which was fine and i was advised i would receive a phone call once the works were done and my car would be returned by 5pm. Later that day around lunch time i received an email and phone call to say the car needed additional works in order to pass the MOT. These works included two new tires which i was advised would need to be ordered in so they will keep my car over night, fit first thing in the morning and have my car returned that same morning. The next day i had to advise my work place of what was happening and advised i would be in late morning after my car had been returned. I did not hear anything from Audi so i ended up phoning at 11am, of which i was told by someone that the lady dealing with my car was unavailable and she would get her to call me back. It got to 12;30 and i still had not heard anything so i phoned again for them to tell me the lady i was waiting for was away on leave and my car was being dealt with by someone else so i was put on hold to track this person down. Once i got to speak to them, she explained that they were fitting the tires now and that they will only take an hour and then my car will be returned. Once again, heard nothing until 3:30pm so i had to phone them once again. I was told the tires had just been finished and that i will get a call back in a few minutes for them to take my payment. After payment was taken my car was returned within 50 minutes, the journey from the garage to my home is 25 minutes. All in all, i am extremely unhappy with the service i received. I missed out on a days work and pay due to Audi being unable to follow up on what they say."
5/17/18,5,"I was seen promptly and everything went smoothly. Staff were friendly and efficient. Lucy was my main contact.

Christopher Frost"
5/17/18,3,"Understood that spring check included complimentary valeting - however, it appeared that only the mats had been vacuumed.
Also unclear whether or not map update (£30) was completed, since satnav directed turn into road (to my home) which has been barred to traffic from direction of turn for about two years."
5/17/18,5,Good explanation of work to be done. All work done in a timely manner. I would recommend the service to anyone.
5/17/18,5,Purchase of a used car from East Kent Audi was straightforward and pleasant. We were provided with excellent customer service from sales executive John.
5/16/18,5,"Best ever MINI BMW service experience.
Definitely going back."
5/16/18,1,"Where do I start... purchased a new VW Polo in 2014 from Inchcape Oldham 6 months after the warranty expired the crankshaft failed causing so much damage it needs a new engine. Although there’s is an outstanding recall on my car connected to the crankshaft nobody can or is willing to tell if it’s connected to the problem I had....logic tells me it’s not a coincidence . Diagnostic test carried out results sent to VW Germany ..... 4 weeks later no response, I have keep chasing them latest update is I can replace the engine at a cost of £7k (as much as the car is worth) and if VW Germany confirm it is connected to the known issue I should get my money back !!!! This car has done 18000 miles !!!! Sam the service manager advised “you were our customer 4 years ago when you bought the car “ but not now..oh we were appointed an executive complaints handler!!!! Zoe another complete waste of time , She suggested we try and see in VW Germany will respond to our emails cause they ignore her .... if it wasn’t so serious it would be funny!!! If there is an award for the worst customer service Sam & Zoe get my vote!!!!! But I guess if VW can survive the omission scandal they don’t care about little old me . Lesson learned.... never by a VW!"
5/16/18,1,"After owning a BMW X3 for 2 years and never having any problems and paying for the 5 years service pack it finally went in to have its first service and have an ISO fix recall rectified at Coopers of Chelmsford. The garage rang and said they couldn't do the ISO fix recall as they didn't have a welder in today (despite having a months notice) and could I pay £89.99 for the AC to be serviced (how is this not part of the service package?). When they returned the car I went to put it in the garage and on turning the key for the first time it displayed a light failure and told me to call the service center!
When I phoned Coopers of Chelmsford the young lady (Laura?) was offhand and told me to drive it to the garage so they could take a look at it, when I mentioned it said ""driving lights failed"" and asked was it safe to drive I was told ""we can't tell you if it safe to drive"".
I then asked to speak to a manager and was told he was away until next week and so I asked for him to call me on his return. 5 days later I have not received a call from anybody and my car sits unused in the garage.
All this from a service to a car that has never had any problems at all from new!"
5/16/18,5,"The collect & deliver option for when my car needs to visit the garage is usually excellent. Hugely time saving. One time the service book got lost but as I have always had the servicing etc., at the original Inchcape location they made another log of all the previous instances which were kept on their computer system, problem solved."
5/16/18,5,"Great reception; all done nicely.
I am appalled, however, that brake fluid is not changed or considered as part of the service contract I use!"
5/16/18,5,Car submitted for MOT. No issues with the process friendly informative service staff. Asked the service centre for advice concerning another issue and received technical advice.
5/16/18,5,"Thank you for the great service. The advice was sound and work done swiftly. The communication was good especially as it’s hard to get hold of me when I’m at school!! Always courteous and the driver picking up and dropping off was really nice. Thanks
See you next year 😊"
5/16/18,5,Staff were very friendly and kept me informed on my cars progress
5/16/18,1,I have taken my car for oil warning light but despite paying nearly £400 for diagnosing fees and repair cost I still got oil waring light. But many attempts to contact the person who dealt with and the centre manager no luck. Very disappointed with the customer service.
5/16/18,5,..........hufyhrhhdhd
5/16/18,5,"Once again Cooper BMW delivered courteous and efficient service. Everyone in the dealership is approachable and helpful, especially Nicole in the Service Dept."
5/16/18,5,"From the booking of my first service,10,000 mile to the completion of the job Inchcape Chelmsford have been 100% helpful, polite and knowledgeable, when I dropped the car off the service manager James was there to fully explain exactly what was going to be covered in the service after which he asked if I wanted to add anything, I asked for additional work to be carried out , during the day James kept in informed of progress then a collection time, on collection of my Tiguan, James confirmed all work was complete and on inspection everything had been done to a very high standard. A very positive experience.."
5/16/18,2,After I placed my order no contact at all with e mails and phone messages not replied to
5/16/18,4,"Service desk man was difficult to understand as he mumbled.
Loan car completely empty of fuel so had to get some before getting to work.
Car nice and clean when picked up"
5/16/18,4,Quick and easy
5/16/18,1,"Hi there, my experience still isn't over. I booked my car in for the quick 90 min service. I asked for the car collection (same service I used last year) I was told that was no longer offered at my postcode and I would have to drive in. I cleared my work appointments and made the hour drive to Croydon for the 90 wait service, booked for 9.45am. I arrived early, was warned as it was a lease car they would need to seek permission but should be fine, worst case my car should be ready midday. The 90 min service took 8 hours and they were missing spark plugs so it needs to go back. I waited 8 hours with only one update at around 13:00, 3 hours into my 90 min service. I had to cancel my evening plans Tuesday night as the car wasn't ready until gone 17:00. The fact they did not have spark plugs for a Mini Cooper at a Mini service centre is also a bit mad. It isn't convenient for me to return in the short term, you will have to arrange a way to collect my car and return it and there must be someway you can get me from a brand detractor to a brand promoter. Currently I have had no contact from the dealer for the plan to replace my spark plugs!! Please help so this is sorted ASAP."
5/16/18,5,"The service was excellent because 1) the service adviser clearly understood what he was explaining to me, 2) the charges seemed fair, and 3) his advice for the next visit was sound."
5/16/18,5,"Easy to book in and did the job, no issues and no hassle!"
5/16/18,5,"First time I have used a VW dealership. The whole process worked well, from vehicle collection, the servicing, phone updates, and clean return of vehicle.
The price was what I expected, and was not unreasonable. With no hassle at all, it will be my first port of call next year."
5/16/18,5,"Very happy with the service, Tom Lawson was excellent and very helpful with answers to all my questions and keeping me updated before, during and after my purchase."
5/16/18,2,"polite and friendly staff but poorly organised, called to let me know my car was ready to be collected after being serviced only to find out it hadnt been fonevwhen i got there."
5/16/18,2,"My car was booked in for a service, when i dropped it off 1st thing in the morning, it was only then that i was told they didn't have a courtesy car to provide me, even though 1 was booked, i was offered a taxi back to my place of work.
This was completely inadequate as i use my car throughout the day to visit teams out on site at various locations, i usually put anything from 40 to 120 miles a day on the clock so when a courtesy car was requested it was because it was needed. I had to borrow a colleagues car and that was only for an hour, so it had a knock on affect to my day on the Friday as well as the Thursday when the service was done"
5/16/18,5,"My Mini is 9 years old (only 29500 on the clock!), but every service with Cooper Mini has always been excellent, they provide a collect and return service and they call you each time an approval for work is required, and the car always comes back after a full valet job. I would recommend them without hesitation."
5/16/18,4,"No real problems, was there longer than usual for a service and MOT but they also included changing a battery cable under a recall. so I was happy at the end and the reception girls were great."
5/16/18,4,Easy check in and car to use for the day until service is done was provided. Was called in time to pick car up and all was done professionally. Well done.
5/16/18,5,Excellent service from Dane motors by all members of staff who I came into contact with
5/16/18,5,Fabulous Service
5/16/18,4,Car was serviced and I waited to collect it The only reason it is 4 stars not 5 is that on the report that mentioned they couldn't examine the spare tyre which it doesn't have and it was 20 minutes late being ready for collection
5/16/18,5,"My car was booked in yesterday for a service and MOT. The front of house staff namely Steve and Steph were extremely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and informative from start to finish. I found the whole experience to be a 5* service and wouldn't hesitate recommending them to my friends and work colleagues."
5/16/18,5,"All good for my 5000 mile service but I guess very straightforward really- oil change, check tyres, etc. Overall experience good though."
5/16/18,5,"Was offered a Spring check of main safety areas of car and I opted for the air conditioning service. From booking, a helpful text reminder, complimentary coffee, comfortable waiting area, clean toilets it was a very good experience.
The air conditioning service has also without doubt improved the system.....So something I would now recommend every few years.
Really glad I booked this."
5/16/18,4,"The experience started by approaching reception where I was met with a cheery smile and request to take a seat, I was offered a drink which I declined. The service manager then asked me to join him at his desk, after a short wait. We discussed the work I had booked the car in for and signed some forms, left the keys and went on my way. Later in the afternoon I got a call regarding the need foe a gearbox oil change at a cost of approx £200 extra, why this is not included in the service I don't know. I told the caller to add this too the list and ended the call. I was told that my car would be ready at 4pm so I arrived at between 4.15 and 4.30 to be told it was in washing and would be about 15 minutes, it arrived at least 30 minutes later. The car was quite clean if still a little wet and there were still some traces of splattered insects on the front of the car. The interior of the car had been vacuumed except for the seats which were still dusty and the estate area had not been touched. The car smelt very nice inside and feels nice and smooth when driving which is good. Overall I was happy with the end result but could have been warned that the car would be later than previously stated and the cleaning would not have been rushed."
5/16/18,5,"The whole team are extremely professional and helpful at all times , thank you"
5/16/18,5,Very good service at Mercedes Benz Warrington Had my car serviced Staff very friendly and professional
5/16/18,2,"My Mini Paceman went in on 9th May for a service and MOT. It was collected as expected. I received a phone call at 3.15 to confirm that works were complete and to make payment. I was told that my car would be returned shortly.
My car was not returned and no call was made to me to say when it would come back.
I called the next morning but no one was available to speak to me and that someone would call back. Again this did not happen.
At 11.45 my car was returned with no explanation or apology, in fact the driver was curt and informed me that there were three other cars that hadn’t been taken back on time and he was fed up.
I have emailed my complaint and not had a reply.
All my previous experiences with Cooper Cobham and Stoke D’abernon have been outstanding, I will not be returning to Cooper Thames Ditton!"
5/16/18,5,Sam was very helpful and even came in on his day off to hand the car over. 5 star service from the Audi team. Thank you
5/16/18,5,"I would like to thank The Cooper Group Ltd BMW Centre Thames Ditton for the excellent service that I have received. In particular I would like to thank Sandra for the excellent customer service and professional approach in dealing with customers.

Sandra helped me a great deal when I have missed my morning MOT appointment and after I explained how critical it was to me to get the service done she did not send me away, but did everything possible that I get the service done on the day.

It is a rare, but commendable to see that this kind of commitment and professionalism still exists in this day and age and I am pleased that this type of commitment is offered in the local to me BWM Cooper Centre Thames Ditton.
Big thanks to Sandra for helping to get the service done and Basat for staying late to complete the MOT service.

Great job and Well Done.

Thanks,

Sergiy"
5/16/18,5,Very professional in all aspects. I was kept informed of the work required by Jennifer. I wouldn’t hesitate to use them in the future.
5/16/18,5,the car was picked up on time and returned with all work done and clean big thank you mercedes loughborough
5/16/18,4,"Good service levels , the only thing that let it down was the 45 minute wait after arriving on time to collect my car"
5/16/18,5,"Big thank you to your team especially Lee for his patience and understanding, love my new car thank you sooooooo much."
5/16/18,4,"Good service but the video inspection was poor and did not show the two urgent repairs that were necessary despite listing them in the full report. Car dropped off at 08:30 and it was not inspected until after 12 if major work had been required there might not have been time to get it completed.

The response from Inchcape that my comments would be passed onto the service manager is all well and good but they need to provide an update on the actions that he is taking to demonstrate that they value and act on customers feedback"
5/15/18,5,I have had first class treatment from Inchcape Southend
5/15/18,3,"Very expensive for what was actually done to the car £1000 for brakes (£700) & service (£300). Good personal interaction with customers but you felt the prices were a lottery.

Not really value for money to be honest."
5/15/18,5,An outstanding customer service. Greeted upon arrival with my name and a smile - fantastic Mike. Kind Regards Samantha Tobin.
5/15/18,5,"Consistently high quality service: informative, efficient and friendly people."
5/15/18,5,I was really happy with the service I was given at Hyde Audi from Dean the sales manager went extra mile to sort my car and Joel sales top man providing a a* service an Danny in the finance he's a top guy always smiling top team thanks for sorting me a great car thanks
5/15/18,4,"After very poor service and complaints to higher management in November 2017, I must report that the customer experience is far far better.
I felt like I was being treated like a customer who does have a choice rather than someone thinking we just turn up because they are VW.

Let's hope the experience continues"
5/15/18,1,We were trying to get in touch with Derby Incape Merced
5/15/18,1,"Since it was my first visit to this dealership , I was amazed at the way I was greeted .A middle aged lady receptionist with her head down just blurted Are you booked ? I didn’t respond to this greeting and even then with ignorance she asked again the same question . I responded by informing her about either Jay or Lisa to which she take a sit ! Is this the way you greet your potential customers ..Someone then came out after 15 minutes ,No introduction asked for me and then took my car away and returned back after an hour or so . The recall done Thankyou . If this is the way the customers the I think it will be my last Viisit to yourselves !
Thankyou"
5/15/18,5,"I took my Volkswagen in to Inchcape for a major Service and MOT.
The Service isvery comprehensive and includes a video of the underside of the vehicle, which you normally don`t see
The cost of this is given to you beforehand and you can book the Service
over the Web.
Since the Service is very detailed I feel as though my car has been given
a thorough investigation and feel confident that it is well maintained for another year."
5/15/18,2,"Car was ready when I was told that it would be however, I was told that I needed one new rear tyre (NSR) as it had a cut in it & that it would not pass the MOT, I was told that the price of the tyre would be the same as the last time I brought a tyre, in December 2017, but, when I collected the car, the price for the tyre had gone up by £49.99!
I questioned this & was told that that was the price quoted on the telephone, not true.
On looking at the fitters notes that the receptionist had they had stated that there was ""no service book"" strange as I had handed it to the receptionist when I booked the car in, the receptionist that I was now dealing with, not the person who booked in the car, then said very condescendingly ""shall we go & have a look in the car?"" low & behold the service book was on the front seat! We went back into the service reception area but, nobody seemed that bothered about it, just a few shrugs as if this was an everyday occurrence, I was told that the car needed new windscreen wiper blades as they juddered across the screen when all it needed was the windscreen cleaning.
I got into my car after paying the invoice only to find that once again the Radio settings had been altered, not a big thing I admit but no music just a ""train crash"" coming out of the speakers.
This is NOT the service that I expect from my local BMW dealer, having spent most of my working life as a service reception engineer working for a diverse spectrum of cars ranging from BL to Rolls Royce including working for Toyota at the Head office, Lexus & Mercedes in Norwich & a spell at BMW in London at what was then ""First Front BMW"" in Vauxhall & feel that I would have been out on my ear if I had treated customers this way.

Brian Glover
PS
Yes the car had been cleaned when I collected it but, not enough to remove the ""dead flies"" causing the juddering, a quick clean of the 'screen when I got home with a bucket & sponge restored the wipers!"
5/15/18,5,Very satisfied with the level of service.
5/15/18,5,Excellent service
5/15/18,1,"The level of customer service here (Maidstone, Kent) is appalling. One of the customer relationship managers (CRM) was less than helpful with my inquiry. After several times of chasing up I have given up.

On one the numerous occasions that I tried to reach the same CRM I got the feeling they only answered my call was because they thought I was another customer with the same surname. No sooner than they spoke they went straight into the costing of spare parts required whereas my issue was to do with a ECU software update that should have been covered under warranty. Whatever is up with making sure you are talking to the right person before potentially disclosing personal (sensitive) information.

The customer services online team are no better than the CRM. I was informed by their online chat representative I would be contacted within 10 days. Its been over a month and I still haven't heard from anyone.

Audi is a good brand let down by a few individuals who possibly do not care about anything except their wage packet. This is a real shame."
5/15/18,3,"I was originally told that my service would take an hour so I could stay in the lounge. This did get extended due to a fault I reported with the car, but even the bit that should have taken an hour took two and a quarter. More communication would have been good as I ended up being there for four and a half hours and didn’t know whether I needed to arrange to leave my car for the whole day or whether I needed to stay put."
5/15/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish.
5/15/18,5,"Good service , i would recommend this company to anyone"
5/15/18,5,Easy and simple
5/15/18,2,"Receptionist said the car would be picked up between 8.30 and 10:00. I had to ring them and they eventually collected the car at 11:00 . Car then dropped off at 6:10 p.m. when they said 5:00 p.m.
Requested quotes for two small items of paintwork. At 1:35 the next day I am still waiting.

Not good enough"
5/15/18,5,Mini Cooper Sunderland went above and beyond with their customer service.

5/15/18,1,"brought my car to Lexus Battersea on the 10th May 2018, following a recall notice to replace driver and passenger airbags.
I dropped my car off at approximately 9am in the care of Phil Weston with the intention of collecting my car the same day.
I received a call that afternoon to come and collect the car which I did at some point around 4pm.

I collected my car from Gbenga Adelaja who explained my paperwork.
Approximately 10mins after leaving Lexus Battersea, I noticed that one of the control knobs on the central dash board of the car was missing. I immediately pulled over to have a closer look.
I then called Lexus Battersea and spoke to an unnamed female who I explained the problem to. She transferred me to Phil Weston who after hearing my description told me to come back to Lexus Battersea so they could examine the car.
After approximately 3mins I received a call from Phil Weston who told me the damage to my car was already there when I brought the car in, and that the proof was the glass on the dashboard was already cracked showing that someone had removed the knob before I brought the car in.
I explained that I was looking at the glass and it wasn’t cracked. He told me that it was and there was nothing that could be done.
Then the phone disconnected. I don’t know if Phil Weston hung up when I was speaking to him, as it’s possible that I drove through an area with low mobile reception. During my drive to Lexus Battersea I was examining the area and saw what appeared to be the “missing” control knob stuck behind the glass, as though when the glass were replaced in the car after changing the airbag it was fitted incorrectly.

I arrived at Lexus Battersea approximately 5mins later. I walked into reception where I spotted Gbenga Adelaja. I explained the situation to him and he left to find Phil Weston.
Phil Weston greeted me and we went to examine the car. He told me again that the cracked glass was proof that I brought the car to Lexus already damaged. I opened the door and showed him the undamaged glass. He then left, apparently to speak to the mechanic who worked on the car. Phil Weston returned approximately 2mins later and claimed that the damage was to a part of the car that couldn’t be seen but it was still proof that I was essentially a liar.

I then tried to explain the Phil Weston that the knob could possibly still be seen behind glass. Phil Weston refused to examine the area, was adamant that the car was already damaged and was insistent that there was nothing that could be done.
I asked Phil Weston to bring the mechanic to have a look that the dashboard as I was more and more convinced that a mistake had been made and the knob was still behind the glass. Phil Weston refused, saying that the mechanic was too busy and nothing could be done.

As I had taken time away from work to deal with the car I had no choice but to leave and get back to work.

Phil Weston’s attitude was rude and dismissive. He essentially labelled me a liar and refused to consider an alternative explanation. I believe that Phil Weston was worried about the idea of damaging a customers car, panicked and made up a story about pre-existing damage even in the face of contradictory evidence.

My car is still damaged and I don’t see why I should have to pay for repairs."
5/15/18,5,I received the usual fantastic service from Paul the Service Manager at Tetbury Audi. He is without doubt the best in the industry and extremely efficient. I am now on my 9th Audi and every one has been serviced by Paul. Fantastic job as usual
5/15/18,5,"Check on car was carried out promptly and was returned to me after 75 minutes, although they had quoted 90 minutes. Nice clean surroundings in which to wait and a lovely latte to drink. All the staff were well presented, helpful and polite."
5/15/18,5,"I have previously used Inchcape Altrincham primarily because of their location, and the level of service was as I would have expected from a VW dealer ie very good. Last week, however, when my car had a safety check the level of customer service, from entering the premises to collecting my car, from all of the staff involved was excellent. I was particularly impressed with the video sent to my phone showing the inspection of the car with the technician giving a running commentary on the details of his inspection and the need, or otherwise, to carry out any work now or at a future date."
5/15/18,5,"Booked my mini in for a service which turned out to be on a Saturday. Got a loan car for a couple of hours which helped me get on with my day whilst service was ongoing. Everything went smoothly and even got my car washed & hoovered. Only thing I didn’t know was to go to the BMW garage as it was a weekend and that’s where you go on a weekend.
Painless experience."
5/14/18,5,Very attentive service. An absolute pleasure to do business with and all so easy. Thank you particularly to Mark R who communicates well and ensures the highest levels of customer satisfaction. Very much appreciated!
5/14/18,4,"I took my V-Class in for a safety recall last week.

The car park was packed and part of it was blocked off as well as they seemed to be struggling for space for all the cars. I found a spot though after a few minutes.

The receptionist was very friendly and professional and somebody came to see me without too much of a wait. The work took about 90 minutes. I was a little disappointed when I got the vehicle back though that it hadn't been given a wash.

I also have an Audi A7 and I have to say the service in Audi (Nottingham) is a little better to be honest."
5/14/18,5,Quick efficient service and mot.
5/14/18,5,"Thank you very much for those lovely coffee and water. We can’t folt the service . Absolutely amazing. And big thank you to the staff .Olivia, Holly, and the gentleman providing with the drinks . Sorry don’t know his name .. kindly

5/14/18,5,Very good service
5/14/18,5,Nice people to deal with. Excellent service. Very happy.
5/14/18,5,"Great Service, Great people and highly competent technical team. Great value for money, special thank you to Robyn who looked after me through the whole processing. Well done and thank you to everyone involved."
5/14/18,5,"Good experience with Cooper Mini at Costessey.
Provided car at the most competitive price and were fantastic in helping to organise a secret ""unveil"" of a new mini to my wife for her 40th.
Transparent with pricing and associated costs.
Overall positive!"
5/14/18,5,Very courteous and friendly staff. Very punctual and love the video of the underside of the vehicle. Garage provides a professional service. In nearly 40 years of driving its the best dealership I have ever dealt with.
5/14/18,4,"Good service once you physically arrive at the dealership.
Booking the service and contacting the branch by phone was a nightmare, will be going elsewhere next year."
5/14/18,1,"From start to finish my whole experience with mercades has been a shambles ! Been pushed from pillow to post with things and the customer service is appauling ! The faults with my car was shocking for a new car ! And the complaints process is just a con! They are only interested in getting your money and once you buy a car they are not interested ! The whole situation has left me stressed and led to me being off work! In the end I got no resolution with mercades and had to sell my car privately and pay £2600 out of my
Own pocket to settle the finance on top of
The 14 thousand the buyer payed me ! Stay well away just a warning !"
5/14/18,4,"The service is always good. However, there is too much communication. I don’t need a phone call and then an email from a member of VW asking if everything is alright and how well you did. I was asked at the time of picking up my car, I don’t need two further communications asking the same thing. Fast and efficient is the key not over the top please."
5/14/18,5,Eddie nellist was very helpful with our new purchase
5/14/18,5,"We bought a used car from Audi Tetbury and had excellent service from start to finish. Alex kept us up to date with what was happening and couldn’t have been more helpful with the whole process, Would highly recommend buying a car from this garage."
5/14/18,1,"Took multiple phone calls to receive a quote for a small job to be completed on my vehicle. Once the quote was received the service provided was very good and the staff were very friendly, however the cost was significantly greater than the quote provided over the phone. Very expensive for a relatively easy job!"
5/14/18,4,Very easy to book and deal with.
5/14/18,5,I would recommend this company to anyone
5/14/18,5,The Staff at Maidstone Audi are extremely patient and very helpful in making a right choice of vehicle to purchase.
5/14/18,5,"Work finished in a timely manner, Henry even managed to give us a 10% discount for the suspension and brake work that was completed. Great service."
5/14/18,5,Good service Very good call back
5/14/18,5,Work completed. Promptly while I waited.
5/14/18,5,"During a drop in Service, I had pre-arranged an apponitment with the new car Sales team to discuss a replacement 5 Series Touring. I had excellent support from Oliver who spent time to ensure that I had the best configuration to meet my needs and arranged for a test drive in a similar model. Follow up communication good and a deal was struck today.

Also, the service team carried out the service and returned the car in good time and cleaned"
5/14/18,2,"Booked a 1 hour wait and fix service slot for two rear LED lights on X3 to be repaired. After sitting around 1.25 hours was told complete light fittings needed replacement and they did not have the parts. Garage staff entirely courteous (no complaints there), but the operating system they use is at fault. 1) Should not have been offered the wait and fix slot when there was clearly a high likelihood of not being able to complete the job or else got in all parts that might have been needed for the job and 2) Should have checked car quicker and advised could not do the job earlier, not after the time said to complete the job."
5/14/18,5,"I visited the Canterbury branch to browse and ended up with an A4 😁.. Joe the salesman was polite, helpful and most of all didn’t push anything, after a couple of phone calls between us the deal was done... couldn’t have asked for a smoother way to buy a car...."
5/14/18,1,"My GTI came back from its service at Inchcape Volkswagen Chelmsford with unexplained mileage. When quizzed Manager said that a different driver bought car back and the 28 miles required to get 4.1 miles was due to him entering wrong address into sat nav. But, it was the same driver. How stupid do you need to be to drive out at least 14 miles and then realise that it's not the right address having been there only six hours ago?
Plausibility rating of around 0. Manager said he couldn't call the driver a liar. Well I can, he's a liar!

And why did the average MPG drop from 38 to 33?

They offered to pay for the petrol he used but no offer to get the car checked for damage

Four years of terrible experience at Inchcape Volkswagen Chelmsford

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"
5/14/18,5,"Excellent service - from the moment I walked into the dealership, the experience reflected the brand."
5/14/18,5,"Easy to deal with and got pretty much exactly the brand new Mini Cooper 5 door we wanted, delivered within 5 days!"
5/14/18,4,Service carried out on the vehicle is good. Service team didnt take out much note of the problems initially and sort them out appropriately.
5/14/18,5,"Previous experience fell short of expectation but this time round, an excellent service and kept me informed of progress every step of the way. Fast, efficient and friendly. Outstanding."
5/14/18,3,"Overall an ok experience. Staff were helpful and able to answer my questions.

There were a few issues - my finance documents arrived just hours before handover, there were marks missed on the car and some equipment was missing."
5/14/18,5,Best customer service
5/14/18,5,Excellent service and communication from this dealership.
5/14/18,5,Always excellent service Thanks
5/14/18,5,"Great help at VW Stockport, courteous and friendly and timely dealing with me, not sitting around all day waiting for someone to see me, a quick in and out to drop off my car and collect later, all very good and up to date with the assistance of modern technology, feels like a place going forward."
5/14/18,5,All works done in a timely and professional manner.
5/13/18,5,"MOT carried out by Cooper Malton Mini on 2010 Fiesta. Work carried out whilst I waited. Finished with a 2 min video of all 4 corners of the car's underside and an explanation of the key points covered on the MOT, the car passed!"
5/13/18,5,Excellent service very friendly and helpful I will use them again.
5/12/18,5,Very friendly saleman.Cars are very competitively priced especially being a main dealer. Not pressured at all during my visits. Would highly recommend this dealership
5/12/18,5,Free spring health check and map upgrade. Even got a free wash and vac. Excellent service provided by Wendy.
5/12/18,1,"Disappointed with my experience. The car was booked in for an MOT, a health check, and a navigation system update. When I went to collect the car, I was told that the navigation system update, was not completed, as they did not have the parts in stock. Even though it had been booked in over two weeks ago. If I had know, I would have booked it for another date, saving me a visit. I then had to book it back in, for another date. On complaining, I was told someone would call me the next day. Two days later, I am still waiting."
5/12/18,5,"All went according to plan. My car was collected for service as arranged. I was contacted about one or two issues, everything explained well. I was told when the service was completed which was in good time and payment was made. Car was delivered back to me promptly, washed and cleaned. Driver and mechanic I spoke to were polite, pleasant and helpful. Nothing at all to complain about."
5/12/18,5,5 Stars .5 stars
5/12/18,1,"I was kept waiting for 15 minutes
Even though I had requested an automatic car none was available for me and I had to have a manual car - I haven't driven a manual car for 15 odd years, the whole day's driving was very stressful.
The A/C service wasn't on the paperwork even though I had rang and requested it be added (I had received an email from you suggesting it be done)
On my way home after collecting my car I realised that the Ad Blue warning hadn't gone out - long story short it hadn't been added - that was one of the things it went in for.
The chap who dealt with me couldn't have cared - he was leaving at the end of May
The only saving grace was Ian Marshall who I contacted immediately after putting the phone done from the service guy - he arranged for someone to collect my car the following day ( a Saturday) and take it to the garage to have the Ad Blue added"
5/12/18,3,"Regular service, was not what I was expecting"
5/12/18,5,"I’ve loved Audi’s for a very long time and I understand more so now having bought my first NEW Audi from Stockport.

From the first swift response and professionalism I got from Bex and the clean, well lit presentation I got from the dealership, I knew I had already bought a car.

The test drive was great and I was kept informed throughout. I would definitely recommend Audi Stockport.

Chris"
5/11/18,5,"Recently bought a car from Audi Hyde, a very professional & friendly service, staff were fantastic & welcoming, highly recommendable!"
5/11/18,2,"The customer service I received was very poor. I ordered a specific part that needed replacing, agreed the cost only to find on collection that it couldn't be done because the part hadn't been ordered - there was little in the way of an apology.

£70 in taxi fares to and from the service poorly spent. I will choose another local dealership in the future."
5/11/18,2,I didn't get a resolution or definitive answers to the warranty checks I requested & not even a courtesy was of my vehicle! What is the point of these rip off dealerships that think customer satisfaction and retention is way down the pecking order of priorities!
5/11/18,5,Excellent customer service
5/11/18,1,"Pretty dreadful.

Had my car ‘serviced’. Originally booked the service online of 24th April. Arrived and everything seemed to go smoothly, and they mentioned a recall which had to be done. I also asked if they could look at the brakes which I was having issues with. They said they would. Later that day I received a call to say they didn’t have the parts needed for the brakes so would need to book in a future appointment, fine. Picked the car up and got home before I realised the service notification was still coming up on the dash.

Called back the next day, and was told that no service had been done on the car at all - so again would have to book another appointment.

Returned 2 weeks later, still no courtesy car available so had to organise a drop off lift. Was asked to be at the dealership for 08:45 for a lift, arrived 15 minutes early at 08:30. Handed my keys over and was then told that the lift wouldn’t be until 09:15, no apology or explanation. Waited until 09:25 before a driver appeared, who then had to take other customers in the other direction so couldn’t take me. I had to wait another 25 minutes before I was picked up, so got to work nearly an hour and a half after I was originally promised. This itself was unacceptable.

Again no service was carried out on the car - the last time it had been into this dealership for a service, they set the interval wrong, so now regretfully have to return again in 9 months time. Will consider using a different dealership, but will not be buying or leasing another VW in the future because of the experiences I’ve had here.

I find that in order to have a courtesy car you have to book about 6 weeks in advance and the lifts are always to suit VW and not the customer. I drive an Audi also and never have I had this issue. They always have a car available and work with their sales teams to offer cars that I may be interested in buying in the future (ie have driven a TT and subsequently bought one - now driving a Q2 because the experience with them has been far superior in every aspect).

Also have a service & tyre plan with VW. Tyres needed changing, but Inchcape won’t do them and instead I now need to organise with another external company for them to be replaced. I would expect that with a manufacturer service plan, then the authorised dealerships should be able to handle this simple request."

5/11/18,5,"My Toyota Prius was due for a service.
Inchcape Toyota Derby contacted me a few weeks beforehand and booked me in. They car was collected at 9am and returned at 3pm -- also washed!
I cannot fault the Inchcape Derby service. They were helpful, knowledgeable and friendly."
5/11/18,5,"Excellent service from Mr. Andrew Fletcher. New Q3 Audi was well

Showroom in Stockport very welcoming with good experienced staff
who knew what it was all about."
5/11/18,4,"Arrived 7.45am, place was open which was nice, then got a cup of tea, which was nice, then had to wait until 8.30 to be dealt with, which wasn’t so nice. Courtesy car was lovely, return in the afternoon went smoothly. So all in all 4 stars."
5/11/18,5,Fab to deal with especially Elle Huntington
5/11/18,5,"A really good experience. Acquired a brand new car on the best finance option. Salesman gave me sufficient info on operating the onboard and drive system to get me safely out and about on the roads. However, it will be many months before I’ve mastered all the onboard options..."
5/11/18,1,",
I booked my car into Cooper BMW in Durham as the wheels on the OSF and OSR were corroding, I had a rattle on the front and wasn’t happy with my handbrake I also booked in the NSF for refurbishment as I had scratched the alloy wheel, it was booked in for two days on 10th and 11th May, I dropped off the car a day early as I had to leave for a conference, I left a contact number as I would not be contactable for most of the 11th, neither number was contacted but instead a healthcheck dvd sent to my alternative number no news on the wheels and no idea what was covered by warranty and what wasn’t, as it was only 1715 I called Wendy, the same unhelpful Wendy who I spoke to on the morning when I took in my Car (she was unhelpful as I wanted someone to look at my car when I dropped it off to confirm re the wheels and rattling sound on the front, but Wendy wasn’t keen to ask and was somewhat condescending, Wendy also proclaimed that the price I had been quoted for my wheel refurb was too cheap and she also didn’t know whether they would be finished my ca rin two days until I pointed out it was one of her colleagues who quoted the price and duration), Wendy was charming again, giving me all sorts of alternatives as to when my vehicle would be ready even suggesting that it would need to be booked in again (when the reality was she didn’t have a clue), the absolute tipping point on all of this was… they said the OSF wheel, although corroded was not covered by warranty as it had been refurbished I assured Wendy it had not and asked when the manager was in. I also pointed out to Wendy that the 2 rear tyres which they said wanted replacing were the 2 rear tyres which were on in January to which they said one had a puncture and they recommended I buy a new tyre at £267.00 and between January and May the puncture had miraculously repaired itself (I did not get it repaired as my pressure sensors on my BMW are that sensitive they would have noticed a puncture), Wendy seemed unconcerned at the seriousness of it.
Give Wendy her due she did pass on my details to the manager “ Neil Tippings” who promptly rang me at 0840 a good 10 minutes after he started work, I explained to Neil my lack of trust due to the puncture which had repaired itself (I even asked his to check the prior health check video where it was stated I had a puncture and match that with the tyre serial numbers to prove it was indeed the same tyre which had not been repaired, that dame tyre they wanted to replace in January ar £267.00). I explained about the wheel and assured him the OSF wheel had not been refurbed and that it was my car from new and no one had used the car. Neil’s charm went up double notches as he told me “if you don’t have any faith come and get our car” (hope its recorded you must listen), I asked him not to be too hasty as it had warranty work to do (they’d found a leak on the diff and gearbox and also recall work), I had to put my kids in the car and needed a car for the end of today.
I asked Neil to check with the Garage I bought the car from (Coopers Durham, transferred from Stratstone Newcastle) to check to see if the wheel had been repaired before I was given the car and to let me know roughly what time it would be ready, and to check into the comments of the puncture back in January when in fact there was none he didn’t do either.
I am left to pay for a wheel which had corroded diamond cut alloys and yet because his expert said it was a refurb wheel it’s not covered he could offer no solution for me

I have contacted stratstone and they assured me no work has been done prior to sending the vehicle to coopers Boldon, Coopers Boldon have assured me they did not work prior to handing the car to me and as far as I can tell my car hasn’t been stolen and the wheel refurbed.

BMW aftercare is horrific and I would like everyone to know about this"
5/11/18,5,"Gentleman by the name of Jim looked after me and my car very well, he was courteous and polite"
5/11/18,3,"I booked a major service for my car and was told by the lady who booked it that car will get vac and wash courtesy of Mercedes. Picked my car up and it wasn’t done. It is important to see things through. Disappointed, as all other main car dealerships like BMW always clean car before giving it back. We have 3 BMWs in the family and as a family were disappointed by the care received by Mercedes."
5/11/18,3,"Only problem was I was told I could come in at 8.30 am and wait a few hours for the service to be completed, so I did not even consider a loaner vehicle. When I arrived, was told the car would only go into service after lunch so it would only be ready mid afternoon."
5/11/18,5,Very pleased with the service
5/11/18,3,Having used Inchcape in North Wales I was a little disappointed with my visit to Loughborough Mercedes Inchcape for a recall fix on a C class. It was expected to takee an hour but it took nearly twice as long. An led in the drivers door handle was not working and could not be fixed as they did not have one in stock. I gained the impression from Staff that they were not happy in their work. As the car had been booked in a week earlier for a 10 am. Slot I had expected the work to be carried out more quickly. Not the most cheerful experience. The atmosphere within the garage was very flat.
5/11/18,4,"Very good and attentive service, maybe the dealer should offer a cheaper MOT though as at full price this is very uncompetitive when compared to other service outlets"
5/11/18,5,"As always service from Inchcape was first class. However, I booked my service using the VW app and they were not informed that I would pick the car up in the afternoon. They quoted a 17.30 completion time which was unacceptable as I was a fair distance from home. Inchcape resolved the issue quickly but I will not use the app again. far better to phone them direct and speak to a human!!"
5/11/18,5,I'm always sceptical about using main dealers but I have to admit the service I received this time was very good. Everything went to plan and I was kept informed at every step of the way. The health check video/report was quite a nice touch but I did get the impression the motive was to sell me things rather than an honest report of the condition. One small thing that was slightly annoying is the courtesy car I was supplied with was filthy inside especially when it was pretty much a brand new vehicle surely this should have been checked prior to me taking it? overall however I would use this dealer again.
5/11/18,5,"Excellent advise from the sales team with honest opinions about our choices.
Received regular updates on our order from Inchcape & Audi.
The whole process and team were slick and professional.
Inchcape Macclesfield is a great place to start your journey to a new Audi"
5/11/18,5,"Very Good. Recently bought new car through Cheshire Oaks Audi.
All went smoothly and new car arrived (A5 Cabriolet which I'm really pleased with ) when I was told it would etc. Sales personnel professional and courteous.
Would recommend Cheshire Oaks and Audi as a brand ( 4th Audi in 17 yrs - I keep them for a long time ! )"
5/11/18,5,"Very helpful and pleasant, professional staff"
5/11/18,5,A very efficient organisation. Dealt with recall quickly and professionally.
5/11/18,3,"The free spring safe check was excellent. But disappointed with the map update as this latest update 2018-1 is a long way behind Google maps and other devices. Roads and roundabouts near my home opened last October but still did not make it onto my sat nav this May. My screen shows me driving through fields on my way home and I would expect a map update to be as good as other competitors.

Update from the above text: After returning the car for further maintenance March 2019 because the Sat nav is freezing occasionally, BMW have finally admitted that there is an issue with many of the sat nav software and programmes. Disappointed it's taken almost a year to get this far but hopefully its fixed now. I'm hoping the updated version which I have to download and install myself fixes all the confusion with colour schemes and updates roads of almost 2 years old."
5/11/18,5,"Friendly and very accommodating. Excellent communication about work needed and carried out on my mini. Car cleaned, valeted, and spotless."
5/11/18,5,For all the service they provide they deserve each start.
5/10/18,3,Surprisingly inexpensive 3rd year/pre-warranty service and Mot. All they actually did was change the brake fluid in the service and try to re-secure some underbody trim but at least the service desk person seemed to know what the mechanic/technician had done.
5/10/18,5,"Great reception and customer service from Coral Randall on the service desk. Was more than happy that my pride and joy was in good hands!
Could do with more parking spaces though!"
5/10/18,4,"Cooper Chelmsford were very helpful and efficient in helping me with my car problem. I especially appreciated Abbie's advice to have a diagnostic test, this saved me money in the end. The procedure for hiring the car was quick and easy and I was soon off to work. My only grumble is that the service department is not easy to contact by phone."
5/10/18,5,Excellent service. Highly recommended.
5/10/18,1,My wife wanted me to get the service and MOT done with Merc outlet so I didn’t go to local MOT centre. Booked for 13:30 on 10/05 at Loughborough that’s the earliest I can get MOT done. I reached there 12:30 and reported to the reception. Within 30sec gentleman came and took the car keys from me. Set there till 15:20 to get my car keys. While booking the MOT I have been informed that it will only take 30-45mins. When I asked the reception desk at 15:00 they mentioned the car was done but no one came until 20 pass 15:00 to inform or hand the keys over to me. The guy who return the key mentioned that it shouldn’t taken this long. Simply they forgot about me. There was no apologies or concerned shown for someone waited 3 hrs for MOT. Really very poor standard of service. I have booked service with leicester on this Monday. I am not sure what to expect.
5/10/18,5,Went in for a service and on the health check noticed a crack in the EGR cooler the staff contacted my third party warranty and arranged for my car to go back in to get repaired.
5/10/18,3,"Long life oil service 8/5/2018.
Reception 0810hrs Ok.
Audicam video informative.
When I rang up to check if my car was ready approx 15:00 hrs I was advised I had been phoned, which was not the case! I received a message immediately after my phone call.
Collection satisfactory but information was repeated which was on the Audicam.
The Audicam report stated my Windows were sticking with a suggested price of £90 +: it took me 5 minutes, a little soapy water and a touch of silicon grease to resolve the problem.
My tyres were correctly pointed as worn, all greater then 3mm thus legal.
A price for tyres was quoted but not which type and whether balancing and valves were included: to be competitive this information is essential, though I realise some customers have more money then sense.
The fruit bowl in the reception was excellent, but the temptation of sticky cakes was also present: Audi should be promoting health eating. Nobody offered coffee!

5/10/18,2,"I recently bought a Jaguar XF from Inchcape Preston and paid the deposit on 25th March. I wasn't given a pick up date so phoned up towards the end of the following week to find out. I was told that it had not yet been delivered from Inchcape Derby but it should be here towards the weekend. I phoned up at the weekend to be told that there was a problem with the V5 and it should be here by mid week. When I phoned again the following week, the good news was that the car had arrived but the finance from the previous owner had an issue. This was now getting worrying as I was going on holiday the following week, 7 days time, and nothing appeared to be running smoothly. Phoning up on the Friday I was told that the finance issue had been sorted but it would take two working days to clear so it should be available to pick up Tuesday morning (I was going on holidya Wednesday) but to give them a call first. Tuesday morning I phoned and no the finance hadn't cleared but if i went in for 11am they were sure that it would have done so by then and to make things easier all the paperwork would be done so that all I had to do was sign on the dotted line(s) and drive away. It took until 12pm for the previous finance to clear and I signed to take my car. As an apology for my two and a half week wait they had filled the tank for me, thank you.
But when we went out to check through the vehicle there was no Steel spare wheel, wheel brace or Jack present. As I was already late for work the sales assistant, a diiferent one to whom I had purchased the car with (his day off), said he would tell my original sales assistant and it'd get sorted when I came back from holiday.
Whilst on holiday I received a follow up call from my original Sales assistant to see how things were and if I was happy with my buy? I was apart from the fact of the missing spare. He professed to know nothinbg about that and was apologetic saying he would talk to the sales manager and phone me when I got back from holiday. He didn't, in fact when I tried to contact him myself I he never returned the call.
So on the Sunday I drove myself to Inchcape's new premises in Preston to enquire about my spare etc. Asking to see the Sales Assistant the receptionist asked me what it was for and after explaining she went ot see if the sales manager was available, he wasn't but would I mind waiting? I stood there for over 20 minutewith the receptionist popping to see if the Sales Manager was free yet, then when he had finished his call, or whatever he was dealing with, she came back to tell me that as it was Sunday they couldn't do anything about it then but he'd sort the following day and phone me. Guess what? He didn't.
So I then contacted Inchcape direct via their ""Contact us"" website, listing the problem. I got the usual automated reply telling me they would contact me via my prefered method, email, within 2hours during their business hours. Guess what? They didn't. I tried the same method again during business hours and still they haven't got back to me.
For a prestige car dealership I think their customer service is an absolute disgrace."
5/10/18,3,"Brought a Citroen C1 (used)from Inchgate Oxford on 20th April for my daughter. Sales staff were great throughout and sold car with a years warranty, breakdown cover and mot insurance. On collection got a validation certificate for the above warranties, which said policy documents would be emailed to me.

When these failed to arrive i emailed sales person who said she would forward the mail to the business manager to action.

Following hearing nothing for another week i telephoned business manager who told me he would contact me later that day and get the documents sent.

Needless to say i heard nothing and still have no documents.

Come on Inchscape your excellent sales service is being sadly let down by poor aftersales service."
5/10/18,5,Very efficiently handled from the moment I entered the Showroom. I left my car for the complimentary Spring service and was offered a lift into Reading by one of the drivers. A few hours later received a ‘phone call to say my car was ready for collection. I also received a video of the service carried out by BMW. I was very satisfied with the service I received.
5/10/18,5,Excellent customer service
5/10/18,5,Everything went smoothly on the day. Thanks.
5/10/18,4,Very helpful & polite.
5/10/18,2,"Left me thinking I received very little service for the money paid. Very much part of a process, with no time to accommodate the customer or the car - the car was not washed despite agreement when dropping the car off to do so and small items which I asked to be looked at were left."
5/10/18,5,Inchcape Mercedes are professional efficient and the staff are lovely and can’t do enough.
5/10/18,5,"quick, efficient and polite"
5/10/18,5,"Great team, great service and my car looked like new when I got it back."
5/10/18,5,"Excellent customer service, well looked after, would recommend Cooper Malton to anyone. - Bryan, Scarborough"
5/10/18,5,"First class from start to finish. Very slight problem that the car smelled of cigarette smoke when it came back, as an asthmatic this was a problem."
5/10/18,5,"A great deal, great service and great advice. The dealership could not have been more welcoming, more professional and more wiling to listen to my requirements, negotiate the right deal and work with me. No pressure to buy either the car or the add on services. Once I decided on what I required, there was no additional pressure to add on more insurances or products.

The handover of the vehicle was dealt with very well with a courteous and non-time based focus on getting me to understand the many menu's and features of our new vehicle.

Excellent value on the price of our ""nearly new"".

Overall - I can understand why Lexus is top of the JD power survey for looking after it's customer both new and existing. I would thoroughly recommend this dealership and I know that when it comes to change my partners vehicle, we will also be looking at Lexus."
5/10/18,5,"Friendly and efficient, excellent"
5/10/18,5,Very thorough and all kept to time.
5/10/18,5,"I tend to regard taking the car for it's annual service like going to the Dentist! - no more however - the staff were very helpful and everything went through without a hitch. There is a problem with parking at the garage but as soon as I arrived, somebody was on hand to park my vehicle prior to the service. I like the fact that there is a meeting prior to the service and afterwards,which means there is time to go through everything. I am very pleased with the amount of relevant information that is supplied in paper form and I also like the idea of Audi Cam as I never get to see the underside of the vehicle ever!

Thank you to everybody including the lady who supplied the drinks - I will be back next year!"
5/10/18,2,"Our car needed 2 visits because a fault immediately evident following the first visit was not spotted by the garage. A hole in a rear tyre was not spotted even after two detailed and videoed tyre surveys.
We were not warned about the well publicised recall of X1’s even though the second visit was less than 24 hours before the headlined media coverage on 9 May."
5/10/18,5,Professional and efficient throughout
5/10/18,5,"I have had several (8) 'new' BMW vehicles since 1990 all bought and serviced by Cooper Sunderland.

Their staff are very professional in all departments and they provide an absolutely first class service.

I would recommend this garage from initial car purchase through to subsequent service requirements and would not consider ever using an alternative BMW establishment

It shows how one can put trust in a garage who retain staff who have knowledge in the vehicles they sell and service when several of their employees are still working in the garage to my knowledge from 1990 until today!

It is a pleasure in this day and age to have such a faith in garage who provide such excellent service!"
5/10/18,3,"I cannot fault the reception and service staff as they were extremely helpful, and attentive.

On a negative note i have visited this garage on about 4 occasions over the last 2 years. Every time the disabled parking space has been used by a car belonging to the dealership.
I did speak to the various people on reception. They were concerned, although did mention their was a constant parking problem.

I am due a new car next year. In view of this ongoing disabled parking issue, i would consider going to a different dealership, manufacturer. I am frustrated that this problem doesn't go away.
A wheelchair user would not be able to get out of their car, so would have to go elsewhere. Totally unacceptable."
5/10/18,3,"Staff are brilliant amazing can't speak highly enough of them,service was quick only complaint email clearly stated wash and Hoover, the Hoover part was done but the wash was at best pathetic.black marks on bumper that wipe off with finger still left and birds muck on the aerial was left,might be better to describe it as quick blast with a hose and a Hoover,service was free so I guess you get what you pay for,other than that no worries"
5/10/18,5,"My first time using Inchcape for servicing. I have nothing but praise for the service from beginning to end.#
My agreement was that the car be collected from home, be serviced and then returned later that day. That's exactly what happened. I was kept informed each step of the way and even received an email showing a video of the car inspectioin in the workshop.
A full written service report was provided when the car was returned and it was even cleaned and vacuumed for me.
All in all a great service experience. Well done Inchcape and Thank you!!"
5/10/18,5,Great experience from start to finish. Every need and question was cared for and answered. Very Happy and would recommend
5/10/18,4,"Needed a correction to a fault created by 3rd party. All done on labour only, plus dealt with emissions recalls (2nd hand.car so hadn't been notified) Over an hour so complimentary wash, coffee and lift into town if I wanted it. Plus gift pack for inconvenience?? of recall
Thoroughly recommend"
5/10/18,2,Flashy garage but too few staff for the number of jobs. Told me I didn’t need a brake fluid change when I did so having to go back again
5/10/18,5,"I purchased a nearly new GLC and was a little disappointed on my first visit as despite the Leicester dealership having plenty of sales staff around, apparently they were all 'New Sales' staff and all the 'Used Sales' staff were busy, so no-one could attend to me! However, Lewis Davis on the used team said he had 5 minutes before his next customer arrived so he would take my details and promised me his full attention if I returned the following day. I agreed to do so and Lewis was true to his word, taking me out for a test drive in the car I was interested in and then thoroughly reviewing my options to purchase and explaining the latest Mercedes and Inchcape deals, which were well worth knowing! What I wanted wasn't immediately available but Lewis undertook a thorough search of the Inchcape network dealerships and found me a car that met my requirements exactly. The purchase, trade-in of my old car, cherished number plate transfer and collection were all handled extremely efficiently and pleasantly and I am delighted with both the car I have purchased and the service I received. Do not be put off if initially no staff are available to deal with you (although, to be honest, this should never be the case). I would thoroughly recommend this dealership and Lewis Davis for a nearly new or used purchase and I have purchased the extended warranty and servicing packages too. Loving the car!"
5/10/18,5,"Fantastic customer service.
Thank you."
5/8/18,5,"Excellent service my car had a recall very easy to book appointment very professional staff especially Kezandra all complete with no hassle.
also big thanks to Amy Stickley for the loan of her car 1st class service.
Would recommend this garage 1st rate Audi Dealership.
Thanks chris Hughes"
5/8/18,5,First class service. Well done.
5/8/18,5,"Clear courteous staff, facilities for personal use whilst I was waiting were good, excellent video taken showing the underside of my vehicle when in for service. Yes, I would definitely recommend using this garage."
5/8/18,5,"Ben and the team at Audi Maudstone made my first visit a very enjoyable experience. I left feeling very looked after, and charged far less then I expected for the quality service I recieved. Ti only popped in for my key to be reprigrammed and they washed and cleaned the car fir free! I would highly recommend these guys for friendly helpful service at prices that won't hurt the pocket. I drove away feeling like I'd been really spoilt."
5/8/18,5,Simple service and MOT on my vehicle carried out entirely to my satisfaction. I am a regular customer and find the customer service here to be excellent every time
5/8/18,4,It was all good. The service was very efficient (I particularly liked the video of the tyres) and the car was ready for me early.
5/8/18,5,"Used them several times to purchase & service our cars. Friendly, helpful & no issues at all."
5/7/18,4,Great service with friendly staff. Thanks
5/7/18,5,"The experience is great ! However, it is a little embarrassing to say that the toilet paper is badly located. The toilet paper runs everywhere due to the hand dryer wind."
5/7/18,4,"Brought a second hand A6, the salesman drove a hard bargain but the service was excellent from start of sale to finish and made everything easy and painless."
5/7/18,5,Excellent service highly recommended
5/7/18,5,"Great service from start to finish, no messing around. Henry Hughes was excellent"
5/7/18,5,"My car was in for a recall and from start to finish the service was excellent.
I had a phone call to remind me of my appointment and to ask if it was still ok. On the day of my appointment I was given a courtesy car as arranged and was told I would get a call when my car was finished.
This was totally the case I received a call and went to collect the car. The car was perfect, had had a total inspection to make sure everything was in good working order and safe which it was. The car had been valeted and I could not of received a better service. The gentleman which I dealt with was exceptional and nothing was too much trouble so a big thumbs up to him ( Pedro!!)
I would definitely use The company again and recommend them a big 5 ⭐️"
5/7/18,5,"A pleasure to deal with, picked my car up on time clean and received a free spring cleaning kit. Will use again for my next service"
5/7/18,5,"Absolutely outstanding service from Lexus... another year with Lexus Derby.
Nothing is to much trouble. Hassle free.."
5/7/18,3,"When I bought the car ( over £38k) , I was assured that 2 services were covered by Volkswagen, I booked the car in and was told it was paid for , I arrived back at my office to find it wasn’t , it took me over 2 hours and calls to try and sort it out , the company told me that the touareg is not covered under this , phhhh I was asked to go home and find paperwork to prove this , as I work for many blue chip clients that I had appointments with I couldn’t no that so ended up paying for the service , all I can say is next time I will go back to Audi or Range Rover ..!"
5/7/18,5,"An excellent service especially the video that shows the engineer inspecting the car whilst performing the health check.
Detailed guidelines and costs of future items that need addressing ."
5/7/18,5,Really helpful staff at Audi Cheshire Oaks. Henry and Gavin in particular made it very easy and straight forward when recently selecting my Audi TT Sport. Excellent service throughout my buying experience and have already recommended Audi Cheshire Oaks to friends and family.
5/7/18,5,"Very friendly, helpful and approachable staff. Easy to book the car in for any work that is required. I found that the work was performed very promptly at a good price. Extremely thorough and I found that the staff go the extra mile and value you as a customer. I would highly recommend."
5/7/18,5,"A smiley, friendly greeting all round and check finished on time. A good experience as always which is part of why I've had four Minis so far. Thank you."
5/7/18,2,"The customer service in terms of sales is excellent and they cannot do enough for you when you are interested in purchasing however the after sales service, particularly from the Liverpool Inchcape showroom/workshop leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. It feels like once you have parted with your hard earned cash for such an expensive purchase it seems you then become akin to a mosquito in that you are an irritation whom nobody wishes to deal with. I did not choose to have a vehicle which required a safety recall, this was down to Mercedes, however it felt as though it was my fault that I was taking up their precious time in trying to get this fault rectified. 2 cancelled appointments, cancelled by them not me and then this last time not to appear on the booking system, however the workshop at Liverpool did manage to fit me in, they must have noticed the steam coming out of my ears. I would like to finish by saying that it has been a joy to own a Mercedes for a number of years but now feel that I may be better treated elsewhere."
5/7/18,5,My car was collected and returned exactly as planned following an annual service and MOT - this is an excellent service as I live 25 miles away from the garage.
5/7/18,4,"Arrived nice and early as requested beforehand. Was greeted upon arrival and asked to take a seat. Sat for 45 minutes to then be told ""sorry, we didn't know you were here"". Apart from that, top notch."
5/7/18,5,"Comprehensive service, excellent customer service and work was completed quickly. Even had a free interior/exterior clean. Will always go back now"
5/7/18,5,Muhamed couldn't have been more helpful. He accommodated extra services on the day and kept me regularly updated with progress reports. 5-star service.
5/7/18,5,"Reminded me that a full service was due, which was part of the tlc package and therefore no charge"
5/6/18,5,"Inchcape Volkswagen Stockport

I have recently collected on a contract lease a Golf GTI, previous to that I leased a Golf 2.0d. On both occasions I have had flawless service and attention from Tim Hayes. He has made the experience a pleasure especially for a leasing novice like i was. Went out of his way to tip me off about upcoming discount sales ensuring me a very good deal on both the 2.0d and the GTI in both cases saving at least £100 per month off the normal leasing deal. This of course meant I did not go to other leasing companies as there was no need to.
Additionally I have used their service department on a couple of occasions and both times they have been exceptional as well. Giving me good service and more importantly honest advice that ii did not get from a neighbouring Volkswagen dealership.
I can highly recommend Tim Hayes and the Service Dept at Inchcape Volkswagen Stockport."
5/6/18,4,"Happy with overall service but a little disappointed that we then had to wait for the car to be valeted
told car would be ready at 2 pm, arrived at about 2.30 and then had to wait until about 3 pm

However happy overall"
5/6/18,1,"NAME AND SHAME THEM - MERCEDES UPDATE



It's a year since I reported this problem with my Mercedes. I convinced them after 8 months to authorise the investigation to be reopened. They Mercedes suggested an independent inspection by DEKRA, big authority in the automative tech world. I agreed to the inspection in June, the car was inspected at the end of Aug.
I have got used to slow, disorganised and arrogant people over the years - but these guys take the biscuit.
I was present during the inspection - 10 mins later it was over.
one month later - I got a copy of the report. By this time I had instructed a lawyer (Liz) to engage with Mercedes for breech of contract.The report by DEKRA was conclusive in my favour, a fault in the transmission, not a characteristic and not conducive with a luxury limited edition model.
You may be thinking whats wrong with Mike writing this on FB! I want to ""Name and Shame"" these guys after waisting a year of my life fighting for my consumer rights.
Of course since the report was sent to Mercedes nearly two weeks ago, its gone very quiet. No responses from Mercedes UK or Mercedes at Warrington.
So as they say it's not over until the fat lady sings - but I am sure even now I will receive another excuse, or reason why they have no liability. If this happens Mr Mercedes, I will see you in court, as I am ready to fight my corner. Liz my lawyer has enough to win Mercedes and I assure you I will have my day in court with you if you don't make things right.




When you purchase a Mercedes Luxury and Prestige vehicle you expect a certain level of service and attention to detail. I have read other comments about this dealership and find that a similar thread of complaints all revolve around poor response to rectifying faults that the lack of communication when you make a complaint. They really don't seem to care and complaints fall on deaf ears no matter what the problem is.

I am in the same boat as all you other customers who went to spend your money on a quality car, believing that Mercedes as a brand would give you a quality product & service. You have an expectation of a superior brand and unrivalled after service - well thats what the marketing blurb alluded to anyway!

I purchased a brand new S500e, hybrid motor vehicle from this dealership. With less than 500 miles on the vehicle it had to be replaced due to electrical safety issues that nearly caused me have a motor vehicle accident. The replacement car was not the same colour but I settled this by the replacement car having a few more extras on it. It was a demonstrator but I had been clearly informed that no other replacement cars were available.

In a few short months the replacement car had developed a clunk and vibration when running in Hybrid mode and running at slow speeds. In December 2017 with less than 2,000 miles on the clock I reported the fault.( Remember this was a demonstrator so had miles on the clock already) it's now May and the car is still not fixed, I have lost count of the weeks they have had it, countless correspondence and complaints have finally forced the dealership to say ""it can't be fixed"" and ""this noise and vibration is a chariteristic of this model"" is the response I received in late April 2018. I have checked with other Mercedes dealerships and they refute this statement and state no such characteristic is known on the model. Somebody is not telling the truth!

The Mercedes factory has ceased building this S class and have withdrawn it from its models offered to customers. No doubt that this model had some serious issues and they will not take responsibility to ensure its customers are rightly compensated for this badly engineered vehicle.

Although I have written to Mercedes customer services including the UK's highest office and management, I have still no resolution to the problem or proposal by the dealership to either fix, replace or refund my money. The answer from the dealership was to take the car back as a part exchange and lose £50k in the deal. Who in their right mind would consider doing that in these circumstances - its absolutely unacceptable and shows clearly what this dealership thinks about customer care - ZERO! When I challenged this crazy offer and transaction, I was basically informed to take legal action because they could not do anymore - you are on your own, head in the sand responses that left me really angry.

Just to finish this long account of my experience with this dealership. At my next to last face to face meeting with the after sales Manager, he agreed that if they could not fix the problem that he acknowledged was present on the vehicle, they would take the car back. The subsequent road test with their chief technition (I will not name you) resulted in the acknowledgement of the fault had not been resolved. When I then wrote to them and asked for a replacement car or a refund, I was told by the dealership manageress, that her after sales manager had no authority to promise me a replacement or refund and overturned her own managers pledge to resolve the matter. Makes you think what communication happens at the top of the management in this dealership.

The car sits on my drive, not driven, one year old, 3,700 miles on the clock. I went out to Range Rover in Knutsford and purchased a new 4.4 V8 Range Rover. I am fortunate to be able to do so, but is that the point?

I take no delight in having to spend my time writing complaints or spilling my frustration onto public websites, however, I just think this whole episode is appalling and unacceptable from a vehicle manufacturer such as Mercedes. The dealership just wants to learn a little more about customer relations and aftercare rather then their profit and loss account. Customers are loyal if you look after them, they also have long memories and tell everyone they know and others about this kind of behaviour and attitude that severely damages Mercedes and their products."
5/6/18,1,"Do not use Mini Inchcape Cobham as garage will screw you over does not deserve to have a mini franchise. Absolutely disgusted by the treatment in this garage. Had been in talks to sell my car for over a month and had been told a price by the business manager, but once Paul Garner became involved and found out my situation everything changed I have breast cancer which has spread to my brain so I have lost my driving licence and I am terminal. After a week of gruelling whole brain radiation I arrived with my husband and car to be told by Mr Garner that the price had changed by £3000 trying to make money out of my dire circumstances shameful."
5/5/18,5,"Excellent customer service from the Durham staff, they were friendly and helpful. Will definitely use Durham again in the future."
5/5/18,5,"Used the collect and drop off service to have my car serviced and M.O.Td which was very convenient and the service was excellent as would be expected
I have had issues with Inchcape in the past with a poor quality body repair but no issues on this occasion - an excellent albeit expensive experience (Mercedes Benz = Expensive!!)"
5/5/18,5,Excellent! Everything went smoothly and Piotr was friendly and helpful. The courtesy car was superb and made it easy to carry on without my car.
5/5/18,1,"I have been reporting a fault since Dec 2017 on a new S500e with less then 2,000 miles when I reported the fault. 6 months later the fault I reported is still not resolved. After numerous weeks back at the dealership I am told the fault is not a fault it’s a characteristic of the car! What a cop out.

I asked for any data or evidence that clearly indicated the car has a clunk and a vibration when driving at slow speed. Their GM doesn’t even answer the mails I send to her. If their is no data or evidence based information about this reported fault, then it’s still a fault not a characteristic. I took the initative to contact other Mercedes dealerships who clearly stated no such characteristic exists on this model.

Readers make your own mind up ! “Cop out or Characteristic” S500e luxury clunking car!"
5/5/18,5,"My husband and I are repeat customers to East Kent Audi. The service is excellent and the ladies and gentlemen there are so warm and welcoming. You don’t ever feel under pressure and they give you an experience of a lifetime.

If you’re thinking about testing, viewing or buying an Audi, my husband and I both highly recommend visiting East Kent Audi. Please make sure that you see Harry B, he made the whole experience enjoyable for the both of us ☺️"

5/4/18,5,Excellent service and customer care.
5/4/18,5,"The Audi dealership at Maidstone was excellent, especially after a poor experience elsewhere. Mike C was extremely professional, attentive and knowledgeable throughout the process of my purchase. From taking photos and sending by email to arranging the test drives, nothing was too much trouble. Mike made the buying process easy and enjoyable, we highly recommend! The dealership was spotless with good facilities and range of cars, all the team I encountered were lovely."
5/4/18,4,"Fast efficient service. Courtesy car provided as had booked early. Service went well and my car was cleaned inside and out on completion.
I was well looked after with offers of drinks and use of business area. Would be better if they had shared how to access the free wifi."
5/4/18,5,First time mot done on Saturday very pleased with the whole job recommended many thanks
5/4/18,5,The service on my car was very easy and i was informed from the time i booked it to the time i picked my car up. The young lady that i dealt with was friendly and professional and made sure i was happy with what had been done and answered any questions i had to ask. It was an excellent service that VW inchape provided.
5/4/18,5,"Car went in for diagnostic. Part had been predictive ordered. Repair completed the same day. Also foc health check carried and video of results sent to us. Highlighted nail in tyre, thank you! Also foc valet in and out. Very happy with the service provided."
5/4/18,5,Ricky Forrest is a fabulous salesman very knowledgeable and answered all my questions. Lots of paperwork to work through but Ricky knowing his job made it all very easy and talked me through everything every step of the way. I would have no hesitation in recommending Audi at Maidstone and especially Ricky as salesman of choice. A very enjoyable experience and am really enjoying my new car. Thanks Ricky.
5/4/18,5,Amazing service for my Lexus! Would highly recommend!
5/4/18,5,"Excellent service, booked online appointment & used the lounge facility to work. Would highly recommend"
5/4/18,4,It's all very slick looking but slow service.Car was very clean on collection.

5/4/18,5,"I've had my Golf serviced at Inchcape Exeter for the last 3 years with excellent customer service, the staff have been really helpful and I would recommend them"
5/4/18,5,Excellent service
5/4/18,5,"I was on time for my appointment, I was given coffee, my car was in for a recall, one hour later I was sent by e-mail a full report on my car, which was returned to me washed and valeted."
5/4/18,1,"Boooked in for express one hour service, which took almost 2 hours with no apology! Was told when booked in car would be washed and inside cleaned, which was not done! I was already late for work due to the time they had took so was unable to bring this up with them! Poor service"
5/4/18,3,"I recently has a service at Inchcape Chester. I had a few issues with booking the service as the line dropped out but all staff were very helpful in resolving this. However I had some difficulties in finding out what time I needed to drop my car, I spoke to 3 different people who all told me different times- which was not helpful when I had to finish work early to get there. Checking in went well I was able to pre authorise procedures I wanted them to do. I received a helpful video on the day of the service but there was no follow up to explain the costs etc., I called back and my person was not available so I was told she would call back, 4 hours later I called again and finally got through where I was asked to authorise things I had pre-authorised, because my notes had not been read. On Collection everything was ready and waiting, staff were friendly and helpful even offering to help my carry stuff. However my car was not very clean after the complimentary valet- If I had paid I would have complained. All in all a mixed service- staff always friendly and polite but some miss communications etc."
5/4/18,4,"I took my car, as always, to Cooper of Norwich for its mot and service. The reception was friendly and helpful, the advice good and the work good. Marred by disappointment in that I had asked for contact with their bodywork shop to obtain a quote for paintwork. I never received a quote in spite of leaving my car with Cooper for several days to enable inspection."
5/4/18,5,"My first time of using them, and I am impressed. No issues and only mild 'selling-up' of their services. Then again, if there had been a hard-sell, they wouldn't see for dust."
5/4/18,5,"Cannot fault the service given by Mercedes at Southport. Have been using them for thirteen years and have never been disappointed. Everything is explained and I just love the recent video of the vehicle check, it just enhances the overall experience. Courteous and helpful staff."
5/4/18,5,Laura at Cooper BMW was extremely helpful and kept me informed of the status through he day
5/4/18,5,"Was met by very helpful receptionist and straight away you feel very comfortable and made me extremely welcome. Facilities are very good and very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. I was kept up to date with my service while I was waiting

5/4/18,5,"Excellent customer service, Lauren was very professional and super to deal with"
5/4/18,5,"Excellent service and competent, friendly and delightful staff from receptionists through to courtesy car drivers. Service managers always prepared to offer sound advice without pressure. 0"
5/4/18,3,"Overall experience was OK. When I booked the car in I was told to expect a call with the cost of the service. I didn't receive the call. Would've been better not to have created an expectation.

I received a call late afternoon before the service date with a message to call back. I tried three times (at about 5.10pm) and no one picked up the call.

I was also told that parts for the service were on 'back order' (I'd booked three weeks earlier), but no mention of this was made when I collected the car.

Delighted with the car - the service falls short of the expectations the brand and service pricing creates.

I hope this helps."
5/3/18,1,"Hunters Norwich. I bought a second hand Range Rover sport from them and the sales person sold me a n extended warranty telling me that if my car broke down or was involved in an accident and couldn't be driven I would be supplied a like for like replacement vehicle, in my experience this is not the case. My car broke down in France while on holiday and the Land Rover dealerships there couldn't repair it, so we rang Land Rover assist and they tell me that I am not covered for a vehicle till mine is required as it is covered by Inchcape. Do not buy.an Inchcape extended warranty as you are left high and dry. The sales person miss sold this policy."
5/3/18,5,Great customer service

Wouldn’t go anywhere else, was completed to the best standard and quality.

5/2/18,1,"Bought a £12000 used BMW from Malton Yorkshire (I live in Oxford) everything was polite during the purchase of the car .Then after not even two weeks the paint and lacquer started to peel off all the alloy wheels.i took it to my local Bmw where the body shop manager had a look to confirm they had been refurbished which is common practice but had not been done to the correct standard,so I would need to contact Malton Bmw.
Of course after several emails to different people no reply.i would like to add that I am a normal working man and it was my dream to own a BWM and after several months of research I decided to buy a it from Malton Bmw my mistake happy when you purchasing a car but any problems don’t want to know.
Stay away if I was you"
5/2/18,5,Very helpful. Totally understood why I was coming in. All prepared and efficient. I even got a very nice car for the day.
5/2/18,5,In the recent short spell of hot weather I discovered that the aircon on my golf was not working. I telephoned Inchcape at Chelmsford and took the first appointment available (12 days later). On arrival I was greeted promptly by service advisor Amanda Foreman who discussed the problem and agreed the best course of action with me. Less than a couple of hours later I received a video of the vehicle health check that had been carried out and two hours later Amanda called to tell me that the problem was fixed and that the car would be cleaned and ready for collection after lunch. I commend Amanda for her knowledge and professionalism. Despite having to wait 12 days for an appointment I still award 5 Stars
5/2/18,5,"Very helpful staff, five star service, trustable team, you got a best deal with they professional trustworthy advice, also very good customer service, very welcoming all the time
Go for it and be sure you get the best advice and deals possible.

5/2/18,5,"Visited for a manufacturers recall. Reservation process was quick and efficient. Great communication when I arrived, and nice summary when I left. Comfortable waiting for area, and lovely refreshments while you wait. Upon arriving home, I had an email of thanks, along with a video of the complimentary safety check. Thankfully, they alerted me to a dangerous tire fault, that I never would have know about. Top notch outfit..."
5/2/18,5,Very friendly and professional staff. In times of falling standards it's good to encounter excellent service.
5/2/18,5,"During my visit to Swindon Audi I found the staff very friendly and helpful, especially Piotr Kasprzak and the new Service Manager. My service was carried out efficiently without problem by Jason Pook. Many thanks."
5/2/18,5,"The car was serviced well, we were treated well and made comfortable during our visit. Excellent customer service by Ben!"
5/2/18,5,Sean Alexander was my salesman and he was exceptional. His knowledge was good and he found me the perfect car. Great service from 1st meeting to car hand over.
5/2/18,5,"From my first call to discuss my intermediate service and MOT through to completion, the customer service i received was excellent. Simon made all the arrangements and everything went so smoothly on the day. Absolutely brilliant, I'm so pleased that it was so straightforward. I shall definitely be calling them again next year. Good value for money, didn't feel ripped off."
5/2/18,1,"Terrible. After sales care non existent. Service centre appalling, understaffed, unhelpful. Expect to wait three weeks if you have a problem or “you could go to another dealer.” Good idea !"
5/2/18,5,"My car was collected and returned to my home very good service.
I thought the charge for the service was very reasonable.
Thank you"
5/2/18,3,"Too much waiting around to be seen. If the car has been booked in for a service etc I do not want to waste an hour going through what will be done. It would be useful to have a fast track system for those short of time.

Should not have had to ask for a refund for part that had to be replaced due to BMW previous service error.

Finally if BMW offer to clean the car in and out why on the inside is it only vacuumed? It’s not a big job to wipe down the dashboard etc. It’s feels half done."
5/2/18,5,"A very good, effective and efficient services provided. Jj"
5/2/18,5,Good service and friendly staff
5/2/18,1,"Smart/Mercedes Benz Coventry.I have had to give this dealership one star to leave a review, it doesn't deserve that. Over the past 14 months I have been let down by this dealership with its poor service. All seems to stem from the top as most of the staff's attitude to service is the same. Hence will never buy a new car from here again."
5/2/18,5,Excellent service .. very friendly and professional team
5/2/18,5,Top Service.
5/2/18,5,Excellent service for the car as well as for us as we waited for our vehicle.
5/2/18,5,Excellent company! I'm really happy with their services! Would recommend to everybody
5/2/18,5,Booked for an A service on my E220d with a courtesy car. Booking was easy over the phone. On arrival reception very friendly and helpful. The service staff appeared after a few minutes and were very helpful. I decided I wanted to wait for the work to be done instead of using the courtesy car and this was sorted out with no fuss whatsoever. Car was returned after a few hours and had been cleaned inside and out. They also sent a video review of the main service points straight to my phone whilst I was in the waiting room. Excellent service will definitely use again!
5/2/18,5,"First service of my Passat estate.
Was warmly welcomed, like a valued customer, by Henry who dealt with me with gentlemanly efficiency. I cannot fault his performance in any way and the service was completed ahead of schedule and within budget - what more can you ask?"
5/2/18,5,They collected and delivered the car for annual service. No problems everything worked as promised.
5/2/18,5,My first visit to have my car serviced all went very smoothly no problems at all....and very close to Southport Centre for a day out !
5/2/18,5,"great reception on arrival, good communication, unfortunately the loan vehicle I was due to take had not been returned on time-no fault of Inchcape, offer to take me to and bring back.I rebooked the following day and vehicle collected same day, great service"
5/2/18,5,"Professional, polite and understanding service."
5/2/18,5,Inchcape Swindon were really helpful and professional when assisting with the purchase of my new car. I heard back very quickly and was helped the whole way through the process. Sean helped to seek out the exact car I wanted and made the process very quick and easy. Thank you :)
5/2/18,5,Fantastic customer service.Love the care👍
5/2/18,5,Good service. They did extra checks at no cost.
5/2/18,4,"Everything fine except that this morning the computer messaged me to say that the Tire pressure was low. Why was this not checked??
Spoiled an otherwise excellent experience."
5/2/18,5,Erald was my salesman and I couldn’t of asked for anyone better! We talked me through everything clearly and confidently. He also managed to get the car out to me in just 4 days! Highly recommend!!
5/2/18,2,"My first appointment for a service was postponed due to the courtesy car not being returned by a previous customer - which was fine. Two weeks later when I arrived, there was no record of my booking and no courtesy car. After keeping me waiting for some time, and at my questioning, the man acknowledged that the computer had a record of my appointment but no one had rebooked the courtesy car. He asked if I could wait during the service which I couldn't. At no point was any apology given by any person at Mini in relation to (a) not having my booking (b) not having a courtesy car (c) keeping me waiting for almost an hour to sort things out. Who takes responsibility for customer care? Eventually, they booked me a cab home which was fine but no apology. Mini has become too big to provide customer care. Combined with the fact that it takes at least 10-15 minutes to even make an appointment, the service level is unacceptable. I always have my MOT done locally by a small garage where the service is impeccable. I'll probably start to do that now for services too."
5/2/18,5,excellent service
5/2/18,5,"I would like to thank inch ape staff and I would like to give a special thanks to Wayne Franklin he helped me understand the problem that i was having with my car and explained everything in a clear manner and he got my car service done super quickly

Kind Regards,

Paresh Patel"
5/1/18,5,"Great staff, Excellent service, superb car..... Job done"
5/1/18,5,"A huge thank you to Stephen Holmes for helping me purchase my first ever car! Very efficient, knowledgeable and professional! With regular updates and contact, I found the process very easy and I was away with my new car in a matter of days. Highly recommend"
5/1/18,5,"This is the first time I have used this Audi dealership. The service was great and attentive. I was kept informed all the way of any additional costs or extra that was needed to be completed. They were also good enough to fit me I at short request for the MOT to be completed.
Can't fault the service. Will continue to use them in the future. Ben provided great customer service."
5/1/18,5,purchased my golf gti from this dealer because they gave me the best deal.
5/1/18,5,"Excellent service,higly recommended"
5/1/18,5,Very disappointed that as a cash buyer there was not a penny off Inchcape price. Millions of pounds of We buy any car advertising implies considerable discounts should be available
5/1/18,5,"Great service, Courteous, polite, well equipped waiting area, service explained when completed, car cleaned to perfection inside and out.

No complaints - By an Audi and you can receive the same treatment !!"
5/1/18,5,Excellent experience and Sean their IT genius is very helpful.
5/1/18,2,"Took my car in for a service & MOT yesterday collected the car later that day to find on my way home the engine light had stayed on, it certainly didn’t have this problem when I dropped it off in the morning. Telephoned Cheshire Oaks Audi first thing this morning explained the fault my car has returned home from the garage with but no one has comeback to me to deal with the problem despite phoning again later but was too busy to speak to me & again being told Simon will contact me. Mmmm still waiting pretty poor after sales service especially as I’ve been a customer of theres for the past 15 years. So I think I’ll be paying a visit to the garage tomorrow."
5/1/18,1,"Never buy a car from them . l had brought audi q7 of them with in the first week I reported the fault to them and they have have a German car to Toyota to fix the fault how dum of them now the fault is back after 8 month plus a major oil leak
They won't repair the car or refund me and I paid them £25000 for the car."
5/1/18,5,Great service from being greeted at reception to be dealt with by servicing assistant. Receiving a video of the vehicle check being carried was a great help and a very nice touch.
5/1/18,5,"Myself,my son and my wife went to BMW Coopers at Boldon as we were looking for a car to replace our car that had been written off in a recent accident. Our son had already approached the garage explaining our situation and what we were looking for.The showroom was very impressive and we were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff.We were introduced to Mr Gary Ternet who talked to us about the car we were interested in. He explained everything clearly and in terms we understood. Mr Ternet then ordered the car and kept us informed on what we needed to do.When we picked up the car he explained everything clearly and patiently, he made the whole process easy and pleasurable. We would recommend BMW Coopers and Mr Ternet to friends and family. Thankyou"
5/1/18,1,"Awful service
Had major service but didn’t do oil change so had to book it in again.Collected my mini but by 4pm not returned it, phoned three times and told someone would return my call, they didn’t, called yet again and they were closed. Had to cancel all evening arrangements as no car , phoned 8am and told they had only just opened and no one answered, again kept phoning and no one returned my calls,then they turned up with my car at8.40 am with no explanation, I am absolutely livid, that no one had the decency to contact me and didn’t return my car last night, has caused a lot of inconvenience and stress, doubt I will ever use them again"
5/1/18,5,"Mark and Ian provided a clear and well informed process in a relaxed atmosphere, allowing me to make my choices.
I'm happy to recommend to friends and family."
5/1/18,5,"Martin Tickle, My car salesman was very informative when choosing my car. he was polite and answered any questions I asked. in 3 years time. I would ask for Martin again because of the help and great experience he give me when buying my new car. Also the show room and facilities at Warrington Mercedes were top Class."
5/1/18,5,"Excellent customer care, kept informed throughout the day of the work being carried out."
5/1/18,5,"Quick efficient service . Great customer service as always. Clear pricing for service with no hidden extras. Vidieo review of what service has been carried and what needs fixing if anything. Clear green amber, red coding in service to see and understand clearly your cars servuce."
5/1/18,5,"An excellent service from start to finish, from the receptionist to the Business Manager. Darren Rostron was the sales person I dealt with, who was very professional, friendly and he answered all questions with knowledge and enthusiasm. I had a great experience dealing with Audi Inchcape at Maidstone and would not hesitate to recommend."
5/1/18,5,"Great experience with Audi!
Couldn’t speak highly enough of Danny Rhodes, huge help finding us the right deal on a pair of cars.
Would definitely recommend friends looking for a car to visit Cheshire Oaks Audi"
5/1/18,4,"I had to go to Inchcape UK recently to get a new passenger sun visor fitted on my VW Golf. Although I had bought the part myself on the internet, they were quite willing to fit it with no hassle. I took the car in and the part was fitted in an hour, as well as washing and valeting the car, which I thought was very good. The Receptionist and the Service Team were helpful and friendly, and the Service Receptionist voicemailed me to let me know when the car was ready, which was good, as I had gone out of the showroom to go shopping in the meantime. Overall, a good experience and a problem solved quickly."
5/1/18,1,"Rather disappointing visit. I was booked in to get a Mercedes Me adapter fitted. It all felt very rushed and there was no offer to actually set me up with the app etc. so I still do not have it working. I was glad they could accommodate me whilst I waited but there wasn’t an offer to have my car cleaned which you expect from a dealership nowadays. No break down of the supposed vehicle health check I was advised would be carried out just an offer to fix a puncture for £30, no form to sign acknowledging any completed work just an empty adapter box on my front seat. Left feeling extremely undervalued as a MB customer and the kind of experience that would make me look at other brands for my next car."
5/1/18,3,"I checked the tyre pressures the morning of the service and they were still exactly the same when the car was returned, if a £500 service does not including checking tyres what does ?"
5/1/18,5,Outstanding customer service...........
5/1/18,4,"great service, car was collected (although it took a few calls to get this to happen!) and delivered back with all work carried out perfectly
car was cleaned inside and out
all in all a great service received"
5/1/18,5,Staff so friendly and helpful through the whole process. Not pushy at all!
5/1/18,5,"Great service , Car was in for a recall repair which should of took an hour but took one and a half hours. But that wasn't a problem as I got to sit and relax and drink coffee, also when my car was finished it had been washed which I wasn't expecting."
5/1/18,5,"I have been using Coopers for servicing my BMW's for many years and always get good service from them.
This visit was no different. The car was promised by 5pm but was actually ready before 1pm. Job done well and car also cleaned inside and out.

Their staff are always welcoming and friendly whilst being polite. They understand the level of customer service someone expects when they spend the money to purchase a car from the BMW brand."
5/1/18,3,The valet on the car was very poor
5/1/18,5,"Fantastic and honest service. Our car was serviced on time, cleaned, a badge reapplied and they even threw in an adblue top up. Great job James and team"
5/1/18,5,"The overall buying experience of my new E- Class AMG has been top class. I can recommend this company on service, politeness and efficiency. This car is my tens Mercedes from this company and they always deliver in spades. Thank you Mercedes Benz of North Wales."
5/1/18,2,"First service very expensive £320 for oil and a pollen filter.
how can it be so expensive?
Car was perfect.
meet and greet was good, people also good."
5/1/18,5,"Friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and very courteous; I was very well looked after by Joel and Daniel"
5/1/18,5,"When entering a Car Dealership you expect the worst, but i was very pleased with my overall experience from the initial conversations with Stuart, whom was very open and honest and actually went the extra mile.
The Business Managers were great too as they knew what my budget was and worked very hard to ensure we walked away with the car of our choice.

Fantastic."
5/1/18,5,very good and most helpful and all on time time
5/1/18,1,"My experience was terrible. I booked a service and a lift to work for 1030. I was told it had to be 1030. On arrival I was the told all lifts are at 815am and no one was available. I waited an hour for someone to become free. I was told it would be £170 based on my mileage and the type of service due to then be told in the dealership that it was £398. The man who dealt with me was rude and of hand. On collection of my car instead of locating it in then car park and taking me straight to it he walked me all round the car park in the pouring rain.,"
5/1/18,4,Actual service was good but a long wait both to drop off and collect
5/1/18,5,"From start to finish our experience at Audi Tunbridge Wells was a pleasurable one and I thoroughly recommend Inchcape UK to anyone looking for a quality car.
I had seen an Audi A8 advertised on the Audi website Saturday afternoon expressed an interest and the following day Sunday morning Adam Long telephoned me as a courtesy call.
After confirming the details of the A8 we spoke about my part exchange and Adam gave me a figure which incidentally was better than all the car buying companies that advertised locally to me.
To be fair Adam did say the figure was based on my description and was subject to a look in person at Audi, but he stuck to his word.
I paid a deposit to hold the car and we drove to Tunbridge Wells the following Saturday, Adam kept in touch through the week and he was there to greet us with coffee etc after our trip.
Adam certainly knows his subject and was able to answer all our queries.
He set the Navigation for us before we left and connected my phone.
All in all it was an easy fluid process and Inchcape come highly recommended."
5/1/18,5,Fantastic customer service from the aftersales department.
5/1/18,1,"I booked my Mini Cooper S for service today for 1st of May 10.30 I received an email with no direction or address I justed googled the address went to Mini Cooper Cobham, when I arrived I have been told sorry our service it’s somewhere else, go to BMW Cobham . When I arrived the someone from
Service department parked my car for me but didn’t tell me where to go I waited for an hour I asked same guy do I have to be here or I can go home the answer was sorry you have to check in upstairs after waiting for long time. Now I’m upstairs and still waiting to be seen. This is first time I’m visiting This service centre and it will be last time ."
5/1/18,4,"You go to BMW because you know the product and service will be good and my expectations were not let down by the staff at Cooper Thames Ditton. Throughout they were pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable and responsive to my questions. The process of choosing and financing my new X1 could not have been easier. The car is a delight to drive and just what I wanted.

Unfortunately the process was let down by BMW in Germany in the delivery process. The delivery date was put back three or four times, extending it by nearly a month and resulted in the expense of hiring a car for some of that time. BMW did not give anyone at the dealership a reason and the overall result was frustration all round that took the edge off what would have been (and has been in the past) a 5 star service."
5/1/18,5,"Efficient booking confirmed
On time
Informed of price pre booking which did not change
Short on time only had the 90mins booked but was going to be 2 hours so could not wait to get car washed and hoovered but other than perfect. Good video review of safety check as well"
4/30/18,5,"Service from Barry and Ollie was top drawer - helpful, attentive and supported me throughout the life of the deal. Would definitely recommend them."
4/30/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish. Brought a car from an alternative branch without question. Car was very well presented and I would highly recommend anyone who wants either a used or new BMW to give them a try.
4/30/18,5,"we were so impressed with the service recieved from when we first contacted Mini Cooper Cobham from our initial phone call, then the test drive and then the purchase and subsequent pick up of my new car.
Chantal was extremely professional, thorough, approachable and informative. She was a pleasure to deal with and is an absolute asset and credit to the Mini garage. Paul, the Manager was extremely personable and helpful which was reassuring.
I would definitely return for future help, thank you"
4/30/18,4,"Efficient,polite and helpful"
4/30/18,1,"Had to be the worst experience we have ever had. From the day we chose our car, it as lost due to not acting quick enough even though we where told it had been secured, then not letting us know until WE rang for a follow up. Then giving us the wrong registration number for us to activate the 7 day insurance. We had to make numerous telephone calls to confirm the pick up time for our car, all of which where never return called. When we finally arrived to collect our car, we where asked to settle the remainder of the deposit but where asked to pay to much as we had already made a part payment previously. Then we where handed 1 key and key ring and led to our car but on checking the car there was no mats included when I asked I was told that the car didn’t come with mats. ( I have bought 11 new cars ( various models ) and all came with mats ( discussing that I have paid £20000 plus and no mats, then to top it all was handed the spare key with no key ring telling me we where only entitled to 1 key ring REALLY THIS HAS TO BE A JOKE. I have been in the motor trade for over 20 years and have never experienced anything so bad as this. If I didn’t hold such a high regard for Mercedes I would have cancelled to order and gone elsewhere."
4/30/18,5,Helpful sales person Colin Chandler. Made sure we able to have an extended test drive and the process of buying a new car simple and straightforward.
4/30/18,5,"Made buying a car very and painless would recommend Cooper BMW Tesside to anyone, a special thanks to Matthew Stott who helped make it so easy."
4/30/18,5,"Excellent service - easy booking, prompt attention on arrival, friendly and efficient service from Frank Cunliffe"
4/30/18,5,Great service from start to finish - a car service with service
4/30/18,5,"Helpful, friendly staff who made the purchase and paperwork easy. They kept me up to date with the progress of my car and it arrived early"
4/30/18,5,"Everybody who works at this dealership is friendly, professional and will go out of their way to make you a happy customer. I have purchased my last three cars here over the last 10 years and had all services and work etc carried out too. I have never had a bad experience."
4/30/18,5,"My car was registering a service message, I took it to Coopers at Colchester for the necessary work. I was given a lift into town while the work was carried out and notified when it was complete, I was then transported back to the garage (with my shopping), and collected my car which had also been cleaned and valeted, superb service!

Should you wish to wait for your car and not shop, they also have a very comfortable waiting area complete with hot drinks and magazines"
4/30/18,5,Excellent while you wait car service. Staff were courteous and helpful and the cost for the service was very reasonable.
4/30/18,5,"We were very well looked after by Kimberly & Adam, they could not do enough for us. Both of them very polite & a credit to you at Macclesfield Audi.
We got a decent price for our trade in & got a beautiful new (to us) car.
We would have no hesitation to recommending Macclesfield Audi to anyone."
4/30/18,3,"I booked online 2 weeks ahead for a service with a drop off at 9:30 , however on arrival was told it would not be started until mid afternoon. I expected a start after i delivered the car , drove back home and returned at 2pm . Car was taken in for a service straight away and I was given a 10% discount for the inconvenience . Customer service after this was good."
4/30/18,5,"Was waiting less than a minute before being seen, Lucy was amazing, very fast and stress free experience"
4/30/18,5,"Went into Lexus Guildford to enquire about, a RC 300h F sport. Spoke with Malcolm Taylor in sales. He took me for a test drive, and I told him the colour and spec I required. They had one in stock, so having part exchanged my car and getting a good PCP rate, I bought it. ( no pushy sales) Malcolm kept me updated on all paper work prior to collection. Very helpful would definitely recommend."
4/30/18,5,Best customer service I’ve received from a garage in a long time. They are very customer focused and that is hard to find these days.
4/30/18,5,"Efficient and friendly.

The whole experience of buying a Mini was fun. I was kept informed all along the way and checked on to see that all was well after delivery"
4/30/18,5,Excellent service fully informed and given a video of my cars health check.
4/30/18,3,|Service was friendly but not what it used to be !
4/30/18,5,Had my first service on my 520 d dropped it off at 8 30 had my loan car and on my way at8 42 you can’t beat that for service 10 out of 10
4/30/18,5,"Excellent service and support in buying new car from Coopers Bmw Norwich.
Chris Mayes was excellent in all respects of the process and I would recommend him highly.
Chris Hunter also excellent."

4/30/18,5,"Lovely friendly Staff, made my wait feel comfortable."
4/30/18,4,"Very quick, price paid was the price quoted, would have been a 5 star but they forgot to stamp my service book that I left on the passenger seat."
4/29/18,5,"Staff were helpful, well organised and the necessary Recall work was completed in the time advised as well as a visual safety check. Excellent service."
4/29/18,5,Service & MOT completed efficiently and advice given on all matters. Friendly team who really care about everything and keep you informed.
4/29/18,5,1st service at Inchcape Romford. Amazing customer service - nothing was too much trouble - thank you Billy and team for going the extra mile
4/28/18,5,Very happy with the service
4/27/18,1,"I have booked for services over the phone and confirmation e-mail received with another car registration number. I have requested to correct the car reg and requested for confirmation, never done.
I have visited king's Lynn showroom today and there is no one present in the customer services area for about 10 minutes, I kept waiting and finally said to one staff that I am going. He said 'ok'. Its really disgusting service, never go back to this type of rude people."
4/27/18,1,I couldn't believe when the driver returned my car with a damaged bumper. They said they were going to pick it up the next day and no one turned up. Pretty poor.
4/27/18,5,"As always it was a pleasure to have my car serviced at Warrington Mercedes and MOT at the same time and to receive a video of the Mike doing the service .
And the ladies on reception are marvellous and so is the coffee"
4/27/18,5,"Really happy with the service i received, very polite and friendly. My Sales Executive was Ross Morgan."
4/27/18,5,"A minor problem with a headlight was taken seriously and dealt with, with full explanations. I was not in any way pressurised to buy a whole new headlight. The charge was reasonable."
4/27/18,2,"Purchased a £40k Mercedes car from Cheshire Oaks that was 3 months old just before Xmas 2017. Its been back to the dealership 8 times for different faults but one reoccurring fault which it has had since January that Mercedes cannot fix and they have told me basically to put up with even though it effects safety. I have now started the process to reject the car but they cannot make their mind up how that is done? The dealership do not answer their phones, they do not read messages or return calls. Their service department do not tell you what they are doing to your car or let you know if or when it will be ready. Mercedes Customer Services or Inchcape Servicing have difficulty contacting the dealership.
Very, very poor support from the dealership. Once you drive the car away you are on your own."
4/27/18,4,"No, problems"
4/27/18,5,"Thanks to the team at Cooper BMW, really smooth experience throughout from initial enquiry to final vehicle delivery. Great customer service from Michael, always in touch and made sure all questions were answered in good time. No issues at all, will definitely be back to see the nice folk at Cooper BMW for my next purchase."
4/27/18,5,Absolutely fantastic experience from both Andy Wheeler and Samantha Cheesman. The whole service from the initial contact to the purchase was amazing. I would most certainly recommend this Audi Dealer in Maidstone and would most definitely come back again for another purchase.
4/27/18,5,"My car was serviced and returned to me clean inside and out and the office staff were courteous and efficient - no complaints whatsoever, my wife and I even received a first class recommendation on where to eat for lunch."
4/27/18,5,"Overall excellent. My car was picked up from home at 9-30 am and returned in mid-afternoon . Apart from the servicing, a full valet service inside and out had the car looking like new.
The video showing and commenting on the underneath of the car was excellent and quite a revelation.
I cannot speak highly enough about the excellent service I received."
4/27/18,5,"Very good service, Audi provided detailed account of the work being carried out on my car. The service driver Chris was very friendly and polite as always and very punctual. Very happy with the service, so much better than last year!"
4/27/18,5,Cooper York found me the car that I wanted - almost within my budget! The paperwork was dealt with efficiently & professionally by Warren & I have no complaints about the service & in the manner I was treated.
4/27/18,5,ED and Tristan worked extremely hard to ensure everything ran smoothly.
4/27/18,5,"Thank you Cooper Croydon for an excellent experience when you serviced and MOTd my BMW this week. You picked up the car in the morning from my home, did your work and returned the car on the same afternoon. It made it easy for me and din't break the bank either."
4/27/18,3,"The service itself was fine, the initial customer service was terrible, however, the Service Manager (Sandra) was easy to talk to.
I'm still in two minds whether I will use them again."
4/26/18,1,"Very poor service from that Audi centre. They have waisted 2hr of my driving. They have invited me for a test drive and haven't got anyone to look after me. They have reserved car for me which they have sold to someone else after . Salesman has been racist towards my nationality. Avoid!!!

Audi Tunbridge Wells has contacted me back and apologise and as a goodwill they have offered that they will contact person which they have sold car too and they will convince to give this car back and they will sell this car to me. I'm feeling disgusted! Very dodgy centre!!! How car which has been sold still appear as available for sale on your website and Auto trader. I'm really afraid to making anymore business with Audi UK and especially your centre! Avoid !!!

I'm really shocked and I do feel discriminated by your centre!"
4/26/18,5,Good service and well looked after before during and after the work on my car
4/26/18,5,"We are thrilled with our Audi Q3.
Lee Bean was extremely helpful, patiently showing us how to use all the technology that the car offered.
We didn't feel rushed.
The Audi Q3 Automatic is a really smooth drive, with nice light steering.
We Love It !"
4/26/18,4,Really helpful from start to finish and I was very lucky to have been assisted by a pleasant member of the team.
4/26/18,5,"Awesome and exceptional service as ever. Professional, polite, curtious and very informative. Am over the moon with my purchase."
4/26/18,5,"It was very pleasant experience, excellent customer service experience and timely delivered too. Very warm, professional and efficient staff. Excellent!"
4/26/18,5,Fantastic service.
4/26/18,5,Great service and very friendly staff there who are always happy to help.
4/26/18,4,"Great customer service despite my car only being one month old and the boot not opening the Servicing team were able to quickly turn this around and fix it.

I like the fact that I can work from the showroom and take conference calls in a quite room designated for customers who want to work.

Only issue I found was that my car was washed, but it was not cleaned properly internally, other than this all was 1st class."
4/26/18,5,The staff at Coopers Tunbridge Wells are always welcoming and genuinely treat you as a valued customer. When I leave my car for a health check or service I feel confident they will look after my car and give it a thorough inspectio and report any problems. To date I have driven away very assured and satisfied. Thank you.
4/26/18,5,Great service by all .well done .
4/26/18,3,"MOT AND SERVICE VERY GOOD, STAFF POLITE AND EFFICIENT UNFORTUNATELY AFTER REAR TYRE WAS CHANGED THE RESTARTING OF THE TYRE PRESSURE LOSS WARNING SYSTEM WAS FORGOTTEN. ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS VISIT WAS EXCELLENT"
4/26/18,4,"Overall a good service with a free spring health check. A good summary handed to me but the definition of one of the tyres was wrong.
I did have to wait over 3 hours when I was told 1.5 to 2 hours. At the end I was simply handed the key and shown where the car was so felt a little impersonal.
On the plus side, this was free and I got a wash and light vac out of it too so all in all satisfied, just lacked that personal approach at the end."
4/26/18,5,"Ryan Lugg was first class throughout. Professional and friendly and in constant communication as and when required.
Warm welcome when collecting car and subsequent contact I made.
An excellent ambassador for Cooper."
4/26/18,5,The service centre had some operational challenges on the day of my planned vehicle service - Lucy deserves a medal for dealing with these challenges very well and providing excellent customer service in the face of the difficulties. All the staff I encountered were very personable and positive - makes all the difference.
4/26/18,5,"Had my car serviced at Toyota Basingstoke on the 25th of this month.
I must congratulate them on a polite and efficient job ; well done!"
4/26/18,5,Excellent staff particularly Colin and Gareth at service department
4/26/18,2,"This garage are useless. I took my car to be servcied you wait for ever to be seen the girl on the desk is always on the phone. The staff are stood around chatting there not intersted in helping you for information unless you going to purchase a new car.
My car went in for a service and the next day it came up needed oil asap and this happened last time and had to take it back again. George is the only reason i use this garage. The servcie person had not put the oil bit back correctly no sorry time out of my day and late to collect children dont use this garage"
4/26/18,1,"VERY DISAPPOINTING

Whilst I cannot fault the me service advisor I dealt with I am overall very disappointed with service from Cooper BMW. I first reported the fault at the end of February. It was diagnosed 26th March. I dropped it off for the work to be completed 25th April. Later that day I was contacted and informed that my car was still being worked on and could I collect it later than I had arranged. On my arrival I waited a further 30 minutes only to be told that the work hadn’t been completed due to the wrong part being ordered. My car is now not booked in till 15th June. I find this totally unacceptable and unreasonable."
4/26/18,5,"I waited whilst my service was been done, staff were very nice. I was kept informed of the progress of the service"
4/26/18,5,"Excellent, as always."
4/26/18,5,"Pleasant,polite, first class service."
4/26/18,5,"Excellent service, constantly keeping us updated on the status of our new cars. Very helpful and friendly staff."
4/26/18,5,"Sam was great .very helpful and friendly .

He gave a great service .very happy"
4/26/18,3,Although I cannot fault the advisor I would have to say that the level of customer service is no where near good as it used to be. I have been going to the same garage since 2009 and feel that the service has deteriorated They don't appear as interested which is a shame because for many people the service you get is part of the total experience.
4/26/18,3,"Pleasant staff but the system they have to follow is chronic. Book a car in for a service, “whatever is due”, car bought from them and serviced since they quote a price and then once you’ve left the car phone you to say £99 to replace the brake fluid & air con that are both overdue. Asked why wasn’t included when I booked it in was told these only “recommended”. The later paperwork says they are “Immediate Attention” jobs!!,,
Servicing is recommended, the only mandatory thing is an MOT. I suppose a marketing trick to keep servicing costs quotes down. Well Inchcape it just brassed me off.
Another thing, I was out of mobile range when the call came through so phoned back to hear the Service person was with anoyher customer & would phone back. 10 mins later & as I wanted to go out of mobile range I phoened again to be told she was still with a customer and no, no-one else could deal with it,. 5 mins later,11:26,another person phoned and said Louise has gone out, but she could deal with it.
So as I said at the start poor systems but the staff are very pleasant.
While waiting for a lift I looked carefully at showroom cars, sitting in all seats etc but was never ever aproached with a view to teling me more. No wonder car sales are down.If it wasn’t for Liam’s brilliant customer service I’d never go back into that place again."
4/26/18,5,"Booking was straightforward. Jordan was an excellent ambassador for Inchcape Guildford - friendly, effective and communicated with me exactly as he said he would.

Service was good - car was well presented at pick-up and the video of the health-check was an excellent additional service."
4/26/18,4,"Service is good however found when I arrived the usual gentleman who meets you when you arrive wasnt there.
There was no video of any health check which usually happens.. .still good service but not as polished as have e experienced before.."
4/26/18,5,great customer service. cost matched the quote and it included the car having a good valet.
4/26/18,5,Excellent service came to my home which is in Llandudno took it back to Liverpool and back to me when the service was done everyone was so helpful and certainly recommend them they sent me a video of them servicing the car which I thought was fantastic also the price was really good considering you come all the way for the car and have to bring it back
4/26/18,5,"Fast, professional & friendly service."
4/26/18,4,"Purchase experience at Cobham was very good. 5 stars for that (Marvin was excellent) as were the support team dealing with paperwork.

The complimentary free service....well as it is complimentary I guess I shouldn't complain but it was supposed to include things like a ""Free Wash and Vac"". I didn't get that. Best get my sponges and Dyson out then!"
4/26/18,5,great service. Easy to deal with; excellent communication.
4/26/18,5,"The service was great, really helpful staff during the purchase - not pushy but provided a lot of useful information to inform a decision. Throughout the build to delivery I had regular updates, I couldn’t have asked for more."
4/26/18,5,Great service!
4/26/18,5,"Fantastic service profitional staff
I will service my car there all time✅👍"
4/26/18,3,"Appointment for my car's ""Free"" Spring Check was made promptly and date of the check was completed, helpful mechanic's video and advice was provided. But, the additional work I requested for the air conditioning service and satnav map update were not completed, and I have to attend again at a later date. I was informed that the Satnav map USB stick was not available!!
Also, although I understood that I had been offered a ""free"" oil microfilter replacement, I discovered that when I collected the car this had been charged for and was an unexpectedly expensive addition, which I would not have agreed if I knew there was a high cost.
The original service agent, Nicky, was not available when I collected the car so I was not able to discuss this satisfactorily."
4/25/18,1,"Booked car in for sevice and dropped off at 9.30am.Called at 1.30pm to ask for update told that it hadn't been started because short staffed (not my problem) car stayed in overnight so had to find alternative way home.
Picked car up next morning and had to fetch myself from back of garage after having to push out from tight space so I could get into my car!!

Overall not a great service which is disappointing."
4/25/18,5,"After 7 years I decided to 'upgrade' my Audi A7. I had been watching an S7 for at least two months and when the price came down to within my ideal price range I decided to visit Swindon Audi. I can't fault the customer service on the used car side of their business. The sales guy was attentive at all times and even though I went to and fro deciding whether to buy the car he stayed focused and was very pleased when I decided to put pen to paper. So I am now the happy owner of a very low mileage S7 black edition, perfect car for what my wife and I need. I would have no hesitation in dealing with Swindon Audi again. This is my fourth Audi over 15 years and I will honestly say the whole end to end buying experience was better than anything that I had experienced before."
4/25/18,5,Very helpful and efficient
4/25/18,5,"Perfect service as always, very efficient"
4/25/18,5,excellent customer services very good work carried on my golf air-con service and brake fluid change software update free of charge
4/25/18,4,"The receptionists were excellent. I was sitting waiting for a member of the service dept to come and tell me when my car would be ready for collection, One of the receptionists obviously noticed that I had been sitting for a while, She asked me if she could help, She then contacted the service dept who responded quickly. The centre is very busy with lots of people and staff moving around, It is very easy to feel that no one has noticed you, Thankfully the receptionists were ""on the ball"""
4/25/18,5,Good Service.
4/25/18,5,Impeccable service.
4/25/18,5,Excellent service from a good team.
4/25/18,5,Extremely professional and courteous attitude from all at the garage. My expectations were expertly managed and the car returned early following the service and wash. I wouldn't hesitate to continue to use them and recommend to others.
4/25/18,5,Excellent service on both cars. Very prompt
4/25/18,5,First class job; friendly prompt service. Highly recommended
4/25/18,5,Service efficient if expensive.
4/25/18,5,"I arrived early for my appointed time, but despite the temporary parking problems, I was seen by a Service employee within a few minutes. Just over an hour and my car was serviced, Adblue added and the car washed. Brilliant."
4/25/18,2,"Mini and BMW service departments have been rolled into one and the waiting time to drop off the key in the morning was bad as around 10 people were already waiting ahead of me meaning I was then late for work. Also The bus left without me as he didn't want wait as long as I had too. Poor service, lots of staff who were waiting around for someone who had 50k plus in their pocket to buy a new car but not on the service side of things. BMW you need to look after your current clients better, it can't always be about sales, service needs to be higher on your list. Rob"
4/25/18,5,"BMW service is always a pleasant experience.. you just know it will go well and it did.. I arrived early and booked in, given a loan car and then collected it later , clean and completed with no issues ..."
4/25/18,2,"MOT completed as expected, however when I jumped in the vehicle there has been no Complimentary Valet inside or out. Despite being told when I booked it and when I dropped it off that it would be."
4/25/18,5,Excellent service as always.
4/25/18,5,"I bought my used car from this dealership one year ago, have had it serviced and recently called in to have a new front wiper blade fitted. On each occasion they have been very pleasant, courteous and professional."
4/25/18,5,"I’ve been using different Audi dealerships for around 12 years and this is by far the best customer service I’ve experienced. From booking my car in for its major service, through to dealing with a warranty issue and getting a pristine vehicle back, it’s been platinum standard all the way."
4/25/18,5,Excellent service as always from the friendly staff. No waiting around for either drop off or collection of car after its service.
4/25/18,5,"Always receive great service from Inchcape Wirral, they keep me informed about what is happening with my vehicle, are courteous, give me a lift to the train station and do a nice job with the wash and vac! While it was in for MOT, I asked them to diagnose a rattle problem, suspecting it was something to do with the boot latch. It turned out to be a crack in the boot which meant a screw on the latch had come loose and could not be tightened, and was told it needed bodyshop attention (which they can't provide at Wirral). Afterwards I thought it might be useful to have someone on site, or even available via Skype who can give an estimate for how much the work would cost at Inchcape Chester so I can then either get referred or compare to local quotes. I am surprised there's no synergy between the two dealerships as it might encourage me to book in there if there was."
4/25/18,5,Have been a customer at MB Southport for 25 years. Always excellent service.
4/25/18,1,"I purchased a VW Up GTI from Inchape Romford on the 19th of May. Paid the deposit and set up HPI for the rest of the vehicle. I then sold my vehicle and arranged a lift from my friend so I could collect the vehicle first thing on Saturday the 21st. I then called my insurance company and swapped over my car insurance ready to collect at 9am on the 21st. When I called on Friday the 20th to make sure it was still ok to collect the car at 9am on Saturday the 21st I was advised that the vehicle was no longer available it had been sold to someone else. I have a binding contract with them for this vehicle ( the document even has the vehicle registration on the contract ) but was advised it was already sold.

I tried to speak to the salesman ( Richard ) who sold me the vehicle and was advised that he no longer worked there. I was then passed to Anton who was now looking after this. Called numerous times on the 21st ( they did not try to contact me ) and was advised the vehicle was no longer available but there were others in the network that they would try to get hold of for me. Anton then advised he would need to speak with his manager and get back to me.

Monday 23rd I called first thing in the morning as again still no phone call and asked to speak with the manager. I was advised that his name was Justin but he was unavailable. I got his email address and sent him an email to advise what had happened and asked for him to call me to advise how this was going to be resolved as on the internet other VW dealerships had this vehicle for sale. I was then called back by Anton who advised that the manager of the dealership was speaking with other dealerships trying to obtain this vehicle for me. I was advised that other dealerships would not sell the vehicle to them but if I wanted to call them and buy the vehicle then I was more than welcome to. After words with Anton I advised that this was there job as at this stage they still have my deposit and I have no vehicle.

Tuesday 24th May AM I called again as still no phone call from either Anton or Justin they were busy and would call me back. Again I called back PM and asked to speak with Justin he was busy but called me back a short while later. He had no idea of what I was talking about so went through the details with him on the telephone. He advised that Dave was in actual fact the Dealership Manager and would have been dealing with this on my behalf but was off. He advised he would speak with him first thing in the morning and get back to me. Had to get the bus and train to work as I still have no vehicle!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wednesday 25th was called by Anton to advise there was no car and none in the network available. He would refund the deposit ( this will take 7 – 10 working days ) to go back into my account. Also I now have a mark on HPI record for credit and no vehicle. I advised Anton to BACS my deposit back and get the HPI marker removed from my credit history. At this stage I await to hear if this has been done.

In conclusion I have no vehicle, minus a deposit and a marker on my credit rating. Not one offer of compensation was given to me or even a sorry. At all times I had to chase to get answers out of this dealership and even at that I still have nothing. If you are going to part with large amounts of cash for a vehicle GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. THESE IDIOTS WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY BUT WILL NOT COME UP WITH THE GOODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4/25/18,1,"Not the usual Toyota Kidlington standard of service. Disappointed.
Car MOT pass at 9.52a.m. yet comes home with 9cm crack on passenger side of the front windscreen! Andy does not return 3 phone calls. Also front alloys were filthy after new tyres fitted, silver birch leaf and seeds in front passenger foot well, not told that all station settings on the radio have gone and need to be reset.
Car went in at 8.30a.m. but was not ready for collection until closing time. A quick pay the bill, here's the keys, car left on road outside the show room door, goodbye."
4/25/18,5,"An excellent experience , I have purchased cars from a number of local dealerships in the past but have never had such an interesting experience in every way. (With special thanks and appreciation to Nick Jimson)"
4/24/18,5,"Stephen Holmes in your Canterbury branch was fantastic from start to finish. Very professional, friendly and approachable. He really exceeded my expectations when it came to visiting a Audi branch for he first time, very welcoming and warm. He answered all my partners questions and queries, and was always on the end of the phone or ready to respond to a email. I feel he is a real asset to your team - his customer service skills was positive and enthusiastic which is very rare to find. Although we had a minor hiccup with the collection date, (which couldn't be helped) Stephen made up for it on the day with a excellent send off and stayed later than he needed. No question was ever to much! Highly recommend."
4/24/18,5,Top guys at tetbruy audi. They found me exactly what i wanted and the car is unbelievable. Great service.
4/24/18,5,"Excellent customer service from reception to the service specialist (Mike). this is my first use of Coopers as I recently bought a second hand BMW. I was nervous about using a main dealer rather than a back street garage because of expense but decided to do so to help keep the value of the car. When told it would be up to £600 for service, MOT and air conditioning service I gulped a bit but on collecting the car I was told it wouldn't need another service for 20k miles or two years. I was also shown a video of some faults that might need attention in the future but not immediately. Total cost around £540 I can trust this dealer. A bargain. I will keep using them.

Thanks, Mike from Mike"
4/24/18,5,"Very efficient, friendly service."
4/24/18,1,"Purchased a vehicle from Mercedes Benz of Warrington - shocking service when identifying faults which they failed to correct. They informed me roof seals were changed however another Mercedes dealer informed me this was not the case. Supplied vehicle with faulty suspension and knock on start up. 17 weeks with dealer and failed to rectify. No option but to take legal action.

Well I responded to there request and heard nothing since - can’t believe the poor service from both Inchcape and Mercedes - PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS!!!!!!!"
4/24/18,5,Great service all round when I recently bought a new M140i. Very impressed with how efficient the team are and I’d definitely recommend heading down there for a visit.
4/24/18,3,"The service carried out seemed to be professional. As the car was only 12 months old there were 3 small warranty items which were attended to at the same time.
I did not appreciate being kept waiting 41 minutes to drop my keys off at the beginning of the day - no apology offered either.
£291.00 did seem expensive for the first service after 4400 miles."
4/24/18,4,great experiance Simeon looked after us . would definatly go back to buy a mercedes benz
4/24/18,4,"Not the same after service now Sarah Proctor has gone, but did what was needed and staff very polite"
4/24/18,1,"My 57 plate Avensis was recently recalled for an airbag fault. I took the car in and it was repaired within 24 hours; so far so good. The problems arose when I went to pick it up. I had the distinct impression that as my car was older I was not that important to them. The Avensis is our second car and we have it because we choose to have an older car, this does not mean that I expect to be treated like a second class citizen. The keys were handed to me and I was told the car was outside. I went out and could not see the vehicle, I followed the car park around to the side and eventually came upon the open security gates. There was no one around to ask (the service person having beat a hasty retreat the moment the keys were handed over) so I proceeded to walk through the working area of the garage, past mechanics and the car wash area until I found the dumping ground of older cars. I saw my car there and it had not been washed. I got in the car and saw that they had not even reset the clock after the battery had been disconnected for the work to be carried out.

The lesson to me here is very clear; if you have an older car your time and business are worthless to Inchcape Basingstoke. Shame really as when the Avensis does wear out I would have used them as my go to option. I'll still look for a Toyota as they are fantastically reliable, it just won't be with these amateurs."
4/24/18,5,"Car service brilliant, sent video on iphone, fantastic service all round."
4/24/18,5,Great experience purchasing a new vehicle from Reading BMW from start to finish. The customer service Ed Le Coyte provided was excellent and the process was straight forward and hassle free!
4/24/18,5,"excellent, no problems of any kind.
courteous and helpful as always"
4/24/18,5,Everything went to plan and I was kept fully informed of progress throughout.
4/24/18,5,"BMW phoned me to make the arrangement. I had a wide choice of options regarding timing and whether I took the car in or to have it collected. When I arrived, I was expected and all the paperwork was gone through with me. I was given coffee and the car was ready on time."
4/24/18,2,"I booked for a basic service and MOT on a 4 year old low mileage BMW. At the time of booking I said I would wait for the car while the work was done. I was led to believe the work would take 2 hours max. I delivered the car 20 mins earlier then the booked time and was again told it would be ready in approx two hours (from the booked time) - hopefully quicker. I went for a walk and returned about 15 mins before the two hour time had elapsed. I then sat for 45 minutes until a receptionist, fearing I'd been forgotten, said she would find out what was going on. Some short while later I was told they were just finishing the MOT! Over 30 minutes after this another member of staff came over to tell me he would go and check on progress. A short while later he re-appeared and told me all was done and then went on to explain that the service had found not one problem and nor had the MOT. I paid and asked for my keys which he didn't have. He then went away and returned to say the car was still being washed! The car had been with the garage for nearly 4 hours since I'd first arrived by now.
An MOT takes approx 45 minutes a simple oil change service probably about the same at tops. They knew I was waiting and I'd booked all this well in advance.
The staff I met with were very pleasant but the level of service very poor."
4/24/18,5,To put it simply the service was exactly what I would expect from a BMW dealer.
4/24/18,4,"Excellent service marred only by a misunderstanding between Inchcape and my car leasing company, something I will never get to the bottom of."
4/24/18,4,my only complaint was that we waited 2hrs 15 mins for our car to be serviced when we had been told it would take 1hr 30 mins. Everything else was satisfactory.
4/24/18,4,Prompt and efficient with polite staff willing to answer queries.
4/24/18,5,"Smooth, reliable service and on time.
Will be very happy to recommend to friends.

No worrries!

Thank you"
4/24/18,5,"mot
on time, service assistant polite and
professional.
5* ib this occasion"
4/24/18,4,"Efficient service by Inchcape, thanks."
4/24/18,5,"First service due and picked up at agreed time. Returned later in the day, cleaned inside and out with reminder when it needs to go in next year for final paid service and MoT."
4/24/18,5,"I was extremely impressed with the service I received at BMW Tunbridge Wells. I had an MOT and they also cleaned my car without charge. The staff were excellent, the whole experience was a pleasure. I am looking forward to my next visit for a full service. Thank you."
4/24/18,5,"Very efficient and professional, as always"
4/23/18,1,Very bad experience at the local bmw garage took my car in for a prop shaft recall after waiting 3 weeks for a date as I needed a replacement car. On arrival I had to wait 30 minutes to be told I would need to come back in a weeks time as they had no courtesy car. When I did go back for the second time I was given a 1 series with 2 doors not acceptable as I drive a BMW X5 as I have children. I then got a call at 4.30pm telling me to pick the car up before 5.30. Not a great experience poor customer service.
4/23/18,4,"Fantastic customer service from the moment we walked through the door, making a vehicle recall as painless as possible. We were led to a seating area and given a coffee, whilst we were waiting to be seen. Jamie-Lee dealt with us promptly and professionally, even giving us a lift to nearby Cheshire Oaks - She is certainly an asset to your business.
Having had poor experiences with two Mercedes dealerships, this one has restored my faith in the brand."
4/23/18,5,Fantastic service as usual from Inchcape Toyota.
4/23/18,2,"I had my car serviced here two weeks ago and came away an extremely frustrated and dissatisfied customer - firstly after being misquoted and secondly for the service I received.

After being told I would receive a full valet as part of my service, I returned after 4 hours to find my car dirty, unhovered and with water steaks all over the paint work. I went back to speak to the service manager who asked me to wait for 15 minutes whilst he got my car cleaned to a higher standard. Having waited, I returned back to my car and it was exactly the same.

That evening I reported the issue again, and was told that this wasn’t their only complaint of the day and this was due to having an interim cleaning company - i’m struggling to understand why this should affect my service in any way.

Two weeks on, and this is still yet to be resolved, this certainly isn’t the high standard of service I would expect from Audi."
4/23/18,5,"Friendly and efficient service, couldn't fault them"
4/23/18,5,Super service. Excellent communication. Promises kept. No hassle.
4/23/18,4,Efficient and friendly service
4/23/18,5,Excellent service and Diane was very pleasant and efficient and kept me advised.
4/23/18,5,Perfect service all over
4/23/18,5,Excellent service - very happy with the car
4/23/18,4,"Professional service and vehicle ready earlier than first indicated.
Service schedule for a C class requires changing of spark plugs at four years, but since vehicle had only covered just under 10,000 miles and plugs were in good condition, their replacement was unnecessary. Perceived a little friction on this point."
4/23/18,4,Quite a long wait for a date given that my car was on recall anyway. And I was very disappointed that all of my settings on the on board computer had been lost. Other than that very good as always with BMW.
4/23/18,5,Excellent customer service all round. Would definitely recommend to others.
4/23/18,5,Staff first class;attitude excellent;job well done
4/23/18,3,"Had a 40,000 service as things go everything ok. At vw you get a car health and the technician videos it, which you can watch I never got the video until I asked the service advisor to resend it which she was happy to do. And this brings me to the complementary wash and vac well because it’s “complementary” doesn’t mean my car isn’t worthy of a good wash and vac the vac was so powerful that it lifted my mats and placed all the bits of dirt and little stones underneath them and the jet wash on the wheels must of been overwhelmed by the power of the vacuuming didn’t even want to take the brake dust off half of the wheel."
4/23/18,5,Mini Cooper Chelmsford. Quality service here. Knowledgeable and helpful staff. A very well organised professional set up leading to an excellent customer experience.
4/23/18,5,"Great experience from start to finish.
Alex Sales helped us to chose the right car for our needs at a price we were comfortable with.
I would definitely recommend a visit"
4/23/18,5,"I was greeted by a saleman going by the name of Andrew Fletcher and he was awesome. Not like your typical sales person who is trying desperately to sell you something you don't want. He took what I wanted and worked his magic to find the perfect car. The best thing about Andrew though was you could have a laugh with him and it made the whole experience fun. If you were going to use Stockport Audi, i certainly would recommend buying the car from Andrew, top guy. Cheers Andrew"
4/23/18,5,"Mr. A.Harrod was a delight with selling me the mini cooper s.

Very professional, helpful, kind.

Recommend his services to anyone."
4/23/18,1,"Inchcape Audi Swindon
Extremely dissatisfied from start to finish. Booked car in for a ""while you wait"" oil change service, supposedly less than 2 hours. Chose first thing (9am) to avoid any prior delays. Arrived at 8.50am and service reception advised 2-2.5 hours max including the wash and vacuum. At 9.40 car was still sitting where I had parked it!! As I was heading to service desk to query an engineer finally collected it. Just over 2 hours later no sign of car so went to service desk. I was told that the safety check had identified 2 tyres as needing to be replaced due to ""cracking and perishing"" Since the vehicle is less than 2 years old and with less than 15k miles I queried this, to be told a video was being sent. Audi quoted £197.29 per tyre; identical make, size and rating available from ATS for £134.74, or Pirelli tyres to same spec from Kwik-Fit at £115.50. Refused to be bamboozled into buying tyres although the video shows the work as ""requiring urgent attention"". Paid and left. Went to ATS on way back who inspected the tyres and advised they were perfectly sound and not in need of replacement. So Audi wanted almost £400 for 2 tyres I DIDN'T NEED and I could have, if they did need replacing, got all 4 renewed for £462!!!! SINGULARLY UNIMPRESSED WITH THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE."
4/23/18,5,The ease of booking car in for its service and professional approach from Wesley on frontline desk when explaining the process was very good
4/23/18,3,Vision Inspection very poor didn’t even noticed a massive crack in the windscreen this is very poor!! Really!
4/23/18,5,Friendly and informative service provided by Inchcape.
4/23/18,5,Very helpful and efficient
4/23/18,3,I assume the work does be was of s good standard. I was kept waiting for to long at collection (about 25 minutes for a 2 minute process to pay) . I was told the work would cost a certain amount and ageeed. 20 minutes later I revieced another call and the price had doubled!
4/23/18,5,Customer service at this dealership is exceptional. Eddy Greenhalgh who looked after the sale was second to none and even helped me out after the handover to obtain a plate for my tow vehicle. Owen Brown has also been a key reason for this rating - heading up business that has customer service at the forefront. Would highly recommend.
4/23/18,5,"I stepped in the show room to a warm welcome and professional service. I was shown the car I was interested in, had the options and finance explained and received a transparent and competitive offer. I was given time to reflect on the offer and not pressured into making any decision. I made a counter proposal which was readily accepted and the car ordered and collected 2 weeks later.

Great service compared to other brands and dealers. Many thanks to Martin Harvey for managing the whole process and coming in on Friday from annual leave to give me the keys and show me my new car!"
4/23/18,5,Excellent customer service
4/23/18,5,Excellent in all regards
4/23/18,5,Attended an event early 2018 to consider changing our Toyota 2015 1.3 Yaris. Staff were polite and pleasant. We were treated very fairly by our Sales Executive Gary and ultimately we opted to purchase a Yaris Hybrid. During the delivery period we were kept up to date with the build progress which made the whole purchase process totally stress free. On the day of the changeover everything was explained very well. We recommend Inchcape Toyota of Burton and furthermore if you haven’t considered a Toyota Hybrid (Electric / Petrol) there are no worries as far as charging points .... the car is self charging! Thank you Toyota great job.
4/23/18,5,"This car service was a pain free experience ...apart from the bill of course.
All very efficient.
Good communication.
Love the new video message you get to summarise findings."
4/23/18,1,Not great as they gave my wife a courtesy car with a huge dent in the tailgate which I don’t think is acceptable
4/23/18,5,"Very easy to deal with. Polite, friendly and not at all pushy. Would definitely use again"
4/23/18,5,"Really good communication, car was well serviced, very impressed"
4/23/18,5,"Excellent service from Maidstone Audi from the moment we walked in to the dealership - test drive on the same day and quickly sorted out the order - right through to delivery of my new vehicle. Our salesman, Kieran, could not have been more helpful and knowledgeable and offered a very competitive deal on the car. Very happy."
4/23/18,3,"quick service is very quick. shame that the girls on reception don't feel the need to smile.. I'm sure they would if I was a good looking bloke... or looked rich! If only they would offer me a cup of coffee when I arrive and they tell me to take a seat and wait for them or when I wait for them again when they tell me my car is ready and I have to wait for the guy to come out and tell me about what they have done to the car. And how i wish they would put the headrests, seatbelts and seat and petrol filler cap back where they were when I left the car with them. Not the treatment I expect when I bought a car worth in excess of £40,000 from them."
4/21/18,5,"We just purchased a Jaguar XF from Jaguar Norwich. What a beautiful Car it is to. The service we received was second to none, 10 out of 10 thanks to Richard Turner. From test drive to picking the car up it was seamless. Richard showed great knowledge about the build and specifications of the car in a most informative and relaxing way. The whole process made you feel special which is always nice once in a while. Thanks Jaguar Norwich. Regards Rob and Pete"
4/21/18,5,"Super customer service from the moment I walked through the door. Couldn’t fault it, would come back here again without hesitation."
4/21/18,4,"Having previously never bought from a BMW dealership I approached the idea of a purchase with considerable caution and reticence. However, with one exception, the whole process was very smooth, professionally handled and relatively wrinkle-free. I would in fact buy from this company again and would readily recommend friends and colleagues to do likewise. The exception/ fly-in-the-ointment was their use of an unconventional negotiating process, which left me in a quandary at first. Gone are the traditional bargaining arrangements where both parties dance towards a buying price which both feel is acceptable. The current practice is very different in format, being basically more in control for Coopers, but they equally ensure they redress matters by offering fairer part-exchange prices. The price for their ""Approved Used Car"" varies, and can be at slightly different prices on different web sites. This is due to them adopting some form of algorithm to adjust their prices according to the very latest national picture regarding demand and supply figures for that particular car model to raise or lower their prices. Having visited their Reading premises, driven and found interest in buying a used car, but wanting to consider the purchase further, I returned for a further visit a day or so later to find the price had risen by several hundred pounds. I had not been warned by the sales staff that price changes were likely to occur, initially leading to me wanting to walk out on the deal, with dented buying confidence. Overall, I proceeded to negotiate and concluded with an acceptable deal and extremely good service and attention from their Sales Consultant. Every aspect of the purchase ran extremely smoothly and nothing was too much trouble and always handled most efficiently and very willingly. Collecting the car was a real pleasure and my wife and I left Coopers feeling really confident we had acquired a first class car with substantial confidence in its reliability and a confident conviction that any further potential complications or longer term issues would be met with a positive response."
4/21/18,4,Pleased with the service except that I emptied my boot the evening before and after the service I can no longer open my boot. The dashboard indicates the boot is open so it will have to go back for a further check.
4/20/18,5,Very helpful and attentive. The car was valeted and washed prior to being returned to me. I could not fault the VW service.
4/20/18,5,Superb service by all staff at Tonbridge
4/20/18,4,"great service, although the complimentary wash was not the best, the car actually came back dirtier, it was cleaner before it went into the garage, even the driver who collected the vehicle mentioned that it was not the best wash, next time i will ask for it not to be washed"
4/20/18,5,"Been going there for over 10 years, always pleasurable and fantastic staff."
4/20/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish! Thank you
4/20/18,5,Gareth in service was fantastic went through everything I needed to know and advised what was wrong with my car. He gives honest recommendation on what was best option for my car. Friendly and very good customer service. Would recommend anyone to go than Warrington
4/20/18,5,Left waiting to long booking In car for service also collecting car after service
4/20/18,5,Excellent communication and overall service
4/20/18,5,Quick - Efficient - no frills - easy peasy. I will be back!
4/20/18,1,"I took my car in for a health check and a wash and vac.

The health check was performed well.

The wash and vac was unacceptable. There were smear marks left over the front windscreen, the offside wing mirror and the windscreen washer jets.

The body work was not cleaned properly s there were unclean areas on the rear bumper, the bottom of the rear door and numerous other areas.

There were dirty spots over the chrome trims on the sides and the front and rear of the car.

There were unclean marks in the inside of the car on the bottom at the doors and rear centre.

I find that the cleaning was unacceptable. It was a rushed job and not up to standard. I could have done a much better job.

I would have asked for a better clean but I did not have the time on the day.

In my opinion this was totally unprofessional and unacceptable."
4/20/18,5,"first i went to swindon volkswagen and the utterly crap attitude to potential customer made me walk out of booked test drive in disgust. i then went to swindon audi and WOW! what a totally different attitude altogether. all staff were brilliant . big mention to kevin lake who sold us a s3 , top man. like to thank all at swindon audi for being excellent at listening to customers needs and going that little extra to help. well done swindon audi i will tell all about how good you are!"
4/20/18,5,Very good service and managed to repair my car that Evans Hal couldn't in over 15 months of taking it back over and over
4/20/18,5,I can't speak highly enough of the service I received at Cooper Colchester. Callum was most helpful upon my arrival and insured all my details were correct and that I had everything I needed including a lift to and from my house whilst the car was serviced.
4/20/18,1,"5 phone calls to arrange 1st oil setvice. Took car to garage and waited 90 minutes at this time presented with a invoice for £354 and a few pence!! If ever you have felt you have been ripped off you will know how i feel . This is the last time bmw will be serving my car...
There is nothing else to be said the labour charged must be close to £200 per hour . There is only so much one wants to pay for a service before they become disgruntled.how can this be a good service to your customers."
4/20/18,5,Everything was done very efficiently and on time. The staff even went out of their way to deliver the car back to my home address.
4/20/18,5,"Very polite, helpful and friendly staff.
I was kept informed of the status of my vehicle and it was ready at the time specified"
4/20/18,5,"All good, Justine was very helpful, thanks"
4/20/18,5,"Excellent service, they were fast, efficient and did all the things requested. They had even pre-order some parts in based on my request when booking the service."
4/20/18,4,"Car in for planned service. Car ready on time, I was given an estimate of 2 hours and they kept to it. Car was quickly hoses down after service although done in a patchy way missing roof and one side. But that’s not as important as the job being done as planned with useful report back at end of service. Overall a decent pleasing experience."
4/20/18,5,"This is a review of Macclesfield Audi, not Inchcape, and they are excellent. Friendly, efficient and good communication from customer facing staff, and careful as well as expert technicians in the workshop"
4/20/18,5,Very efficient. The interior of my quite old and well used car has not looked so good in a very long time. Well done whoever did the valeting.
4/20/18,1,"Polo GTI 1.4. So much time, effort, sleep and tears have been lost to this provider of Volkswagen vehicles. Three weeks it took me to actually be able to sit in my car and drive it for the first time! Deposit paid and lied to about its condition and availability. I've honestly lost track at all the things that have happened within three weeks! So many hold ups, mainly due to incompetent staff and external damage. That I wasnt made aware of at purchase. Due to be collected for the fifth time last Friday. They were replacing a tyre and the mechanic dropped and damaged my allow wheel. Forcing me to wait another week at the hands of their highly incompetent staff. The cars been finally delivered to me with a chip in the windscreen, filthy interior and to add to my troubles... Drives like its on a frame that was just built for a Red Bull Soap Box rally! I've driven it a total of 2 miles around the block and now I'm giving it back!! The most absolute worst customer service I've ever had to suffer. From the receptionist who lies to you to the managers who quote... ""Don't really care about your car. Because they're leaving the company!"". Never ever use this branch. Romford Inchcape is a despicable service. Hugely unsatisfactory, a total disappointment and a waste of your time and money. 0.1/5"
4/20/18,3,"Brake fluid service.
All went fine.
I opted to have a health check which cost an extra £45
An email arrived the day after saying book in for a free spring safety health check!!!
Which I wasn’t told about when I went in.
Never had a bmw before and heard rumours about them always trying to get as much cash out of you as possible.
I suppose the rumours are true!"
4/19/18,2,"My wife, with a two month old baby was shouted at for parking in the wrong place.

- that’s a little extreme. The mechanic watched my wife get a buggy out, sort out the bags, empty the car, get the baby out and then ran over and shouted at her in close proximity that she was in the wrong parking spot.

Is that really a big deal? One worthy of such rude conduct.

My wife then moved the car, got out again only to receive and icy reception inside.

I’m not sure if that’s sexist, racist or both but it’s unacceptable.

The work was however done very quickly, and of course they found some additional items which need fixing. Sent me a nice video too of all the faults. However, I’ve asked for a quote and not received an answer... so not sure on next steps.

They cleaned the car too, and that was a good valet.

The reality is, this is a service industry. The people were odd, but the work was good. It’s just a shame they made my wife feel so uncomfortable."
4/19/18,4,"The service and contact with Chris was first class, my only disappointment was valet and wash for the car which was part of the package. Car was washed but inside of car not done at all."
4/19/18,4,"A very satisfying experience in buying a new car. We were looked after from the very beginning to the day we collected the car.
The only problem was the lack of parking for our exchange car."
4/19/18,5,I have received good and courteous service from all the Inchcape Romford staff.
4/19/18,4,Great service from Mini Colchester definitely James who is been a good customer service guide.
4/19/18,5,"Collected, returned car as promised; kept informed re work; price came in cheaper than quote; very good valet"
4/19/18,5,everyone was very helpful. the whole process went through without a hitch
4/19/18,5,"Really warm reception - with coffee and
biscuit !
Gentleman had all the forms completed and just required my signature and driving licence as providing a courtesy car. Another big plus as a lovely new model. On return no problem whatsoever. Very pleased with the whole process."
4/19/18,5,Excellent service. Really friendly people. Kept us informed. Did enjoy free coffees. All in all very good.
4/19/18,5,"Graham answered all our questions and was extremely helpful throughout the whole purchasing process. He was polite and courteous with a good knowledge of the car and purchasing system. In fact, everyone we met was approachable and polite, displaying a good customer service and excellent team work from our perspective. Thank you."
4/19/18,5,"Excellent service
Kal Mutch- salesman was very helpful helping us picking our car.
Car arrived on time - the handover of our new car was quick and efficient thanks to Kal Mitch."
4/19/18,5,Fantastic customer service from Samantha when we bought our Mini.
4/19/18,5,Attentive service and always readily available to answer any queries you may have. Couldn’t fault my experience at all.
4/19/18,5,Excellent customer service. Job done no fuss.
4/19/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish ! Highly recommend this dealership.
4/19/18,5,"Good service, did everything asked..."
4/19/18,5,Excellent service.
4/19/18,5,"A very professional, well run operation, everything is done to a high standard and it is explained to you what is being done and why. I would recommend them to anyone and will be returning there in the future"
4/19/18,5,I took my Audi into Inchcape Hyde to have the AC heater replaced under guarrantee and came away with an upgraded motor so they must be doing something right?Great staf and everyone i came into contact with were pleasant and they all seemed to care that I was being looked after and nothing was to much trouble for them
4/18/18,3,"Service more expensive than expected/ advised , despite discussing exact concern prior.

Will favour a local ( bmw trained) Service Co next time."
4/18/18,5,"I’ve just bought a used A6 Avant through David Mano one of the sales representatives and the whole experience was very easy and enjoyable. The majority of Audi’s sell themselves but I still didn’t feel pressured into any of the addons that come with buying a car.
The car was serviced, given an MOT and the body work was brought up to a glistening finish. A panel was due to be replaced which didn’t happen but I am waiting on the part to be delivered so it can be replaced in Preston. So assuming this happens as agreed pre sale then overall a positive, happy and easy experience."
4/18/18,5,An excellent experience. My car was collected from my workplace and returned by lunchtime. I loved the video that was messaged to me by the mechanic who did the service!
4/18/18,5,"Fantastic service from staff at Cheshire Oaks Audi, all the staff were really friendly and helpful and a pleasure to deal with"
4/18/18,5,I have always had excellent service at inchape vw Chester. The guy who dealt with me regarding this years service and M.O.T Nick Blezard went through everything with me to make sure everything was correct and I was happy and when I collected my car it was lovely and clean inside and out. Very satisfied
4/18/18,5,Excellent service. Staff very polite and helpful and thanks to Gary and the staff member who was helping to park the cars.
4/18/18,5,First service on Golf R at Chelmsford branch. Very clean environment and overall service and staff were great. Car returned very clean and smart looking after while you wait service.
4/18/18,5,"Where do I start? From the moment i stepped inside Cooper Thames Ditton Mini, I felt I was in the right place to purchase my new Mini. That was when I stepped in. Now, in my view, is the best place to buy your Mini. Alex at the reception was very welcoming and professional. My salesman was Alex Apetri. I can’t praise Alex Apetri enough for his customer service skills, which are of the highest level. Alex listened to what I wanted. He never put pressure on me like some salesmen do. Alex was very emphatic and his sincerity is felt when you speak with him.
I brought my 13 year old son with me for test drive and Alex engaged with him and got him involved.
In case you are wondering, I bought the Mini Cooper 25th Anniversary Edition - We love it."
4/18/18,1,"I took my car in for a recall on airbag.
Everything was reset including clock to incorrect time and now my windows are not shutting correctly, what have they done to my electrics !!!"
4/18/18,5,I like to look after my Mini Cooper so for me the Mini garage in Ipswich is the only place I am completely happy to take my car.Always had excellent service here and they obviously know what they are doing.
4/18/18,5,Very attentive to my requirements from the booking booking process to the return of my vehicle
4/18/18,5,"Excellent, speedy, and friendly service. Georgia Dunne and Josh Durrant were extremely accommodating, and Josh even waited after hours as I wasn’t able to get to the garage in time - this was much appreciated. I was kept updated and my car was fixed within the day which was not expected. I also received a video talking me through the underside of my car to confirm everything was OK and provided advice on a tyre. Brilliant customer service."
4/18/18,2,I don't really enjoy dealing with Inchcape. They seem fine and friendly until they find out you're not going to buy any of their overpriced services from them then you're treated just like a number. Promised me a callback regarding details of my service plan....still waiting.
4/18/18,5,"Excellent service. Just changed to VW and this is the best costumer service I’ve had for a long time.
Thanks"
4/18/18,5,I have had fantastic service from Inchape Bolton. I have not been able to drive due to a hip problem for a few months and they kindly picked my car up and brought it back. It was cleaned inside and out and looked sparkling. The ladies on reception and in the service centre were extremely helpful and pleasant and the mechanic who changed the oil and refilled the air conditioning was very professional on the video I received. All in all excellent service as usual.
4/18/18,3,"Unfortunately, it was virtually impossible to park the car on arrival anywhere safe. The place was highly congested and the attendant who took over the car for parking could not find a place for it and parked it with half the car protruding into the path of other vehicles. I voiced my concern to him but he said he would keep an eye on it. However, when we came back to collect the car we found some new scratches on the driver's door and complained to the advisor looking after us. He requested a photo of the scratches to be sent to him to follow up on. This was done right away but I have heard nothing.

Furthermore, the car was in of a change of break fluid, a new MOT and end of warranty check. During the latter the technician discovered a joint gaiter leaking but did nothing about it and the advisor would not consider replacing it under warranty although the car was still within the warranty period."
4/18/18,5,The help and advice I got was the best so helpful
4/18/18,1,"Avoid if possible

I booked my car's annual service at this centre recently and the experience was pathetic. On collection, I found a scratch on car's bumper, not washed as they market it complimentary and the service history book wasn't signed. You don't expect this to happen at BMW service centres but local garages. I had to then chase for appointment to get the bumper work done. The staff couldn't apologise enough but were too busy to handle the case promptly.

Furthermore, this is the first BMW service centre where I have seen customers standing in queue for their turn to speak to service team. In other centres, you will be kindly asked to wait in the reception and the first available executive will come to speak to you and book in. Something easy to implement but no one bothers about little gestures here I think.

Will go to other centres before choosing this one next time."
4/18/18,4,"Mercedes recall on Airbag.
The Mercedes dealer of Southport took the car into their service bay with a promise to return the car in 1 Hour. This they duly did meeting their turnaround target. I was able to sit and wait with free coffee from the machine.
My only reservation was that I got little feedback about what was done and there was no paperwork on completion.
It was a free recall so not a lot to be expected. Presumed it is all on the computer somewhere."
4/18/18,5,"Superb service - booking in very simple, no issues on the day from courtesy car to work done. Lucy in service was great."
4/18/18,5,Received usual good customer care from BMW Chelmsford. Booked curtesy car which was available for me and service completed very satisfactorily . Everything done on time and my car cleaned ready for me to drive away.
4/18/18,5,"Having taken in my car for a service, Calum Pimm was excellent throughout and offered me great customer service."
4/18/18,5,"Fantastic experience. Faultless Service, pleasant, efficient staff. The gentleman who looked after me did a fantastic job a credit to the company.

Full marks."
4/18/18,5,"Took my BMW in for a recall issue and antenatal health check. The lady at the service desk couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Everything was talked through and checked, got given a lovely loan car whilst my car was being looked after. I was consulted when a tyre needed replacing and they price matched.
Excellent service."
4/18/18,5,Excellent service. Very flexible around my diary to fit the car in to services. Communication was great.
4/18/18,5,"James Churchill from Colchester has been amazing!
Thank you made the whole experience so smooth & couldn’t be more helpful!"
4/18/18,4,"Wes was very helpful when I took my car in for a service, showing me to my car when picking up. The one issue was even though the cleaning of the car is ‘complimentary’ I felt that it had not been cleaned to the usual of VW’s normal high standards in everything they do. The carpets we’re clean and so was the dash but I found that the steering wheel had not been touched and was very dirty and also the wheels still had dirt on them."
4/18/18,5,A gentleman collected my car from my home. All necessary repairs were carried out. I paid over the 'phone. He drove it back later same day - brilliant!
4/18/18,5,My only experience with Inchcape was in connection with a product recall concerning the airbags in my Toyota RAV-4. They contacted me by mail and I arranged an appointment over the phone. They phoned the day before as a reminder and the work was carried out within the expected time while I waited and drank coffee. They also carried out a vehicle inspection and washed the car afterwards free of charge.
4/18/18,4,"My car was collected for service and MOT. Cooper Banstead were supposed to ring us the day before to tell us what time they would arrive but failed to do so. The time range was 8.30 to 11.30 but arrived at 8.20 which caught us by surprise. Otherwise, all went well."
4/18/18,5,"Excellent alround service from booking on web page too interaction with the reception and service team in Loughbourough.,Very professional I would say on their game."
4/18/18,3,"Average for Audi : They cleaned the carpets and nothing else - missed all the area around the gear stick, control surfaces etc... either do it correctly or not at all. Never understand why there seems to be a need to toss the Log Book on the floor and not put it back into the drawer"
4/18/18,5,Excellent service and value always in safe hands!
4/18/18,2,"Although I'm hoping a decent job was done with the car (I'll never know), it was a nightmare to get through to the service dept (i was sent via a call centre in Norwich!) and it took me 4 attempts. Our car was supposed to be delivered back and was three hours late. The garage seemed to be in disarray. A total shambles.
I even rang 2 weeks earlier to enquire about buying a new car and despite the salesman taking my specifications and details, he never rang me back.

Mystery how this garage does any business at all."
4/18/18,4,"4.5 stars rather than 4 - and can't be a 5 because I know many people that wouldn't pay the extra 10-20% average cost. Nothing to criticise (apart from the multiple requests to put a review on!). Expensive yes but you get what you pay for so no complaints there. All staff were super courteous and very helpful once you get past the initial ...' oooh all of our courtesy cars are booked' standard statement but then you get the 'I'll see what I can do for you' and of course the rabbit comes out of the hat. Bearing in mind part of the work was a recall, I would expect them to go the extra mile anyway."
4/18/18,5,i purchased my car from Loughborough was treated with the upmost respect as a woman on my own was not fobbed of or put under any presure to buy just had my first service absolutely fab all the information could not be any better. thank you.
4/18/18,5,"A very good service from start to finish.
Kept me informed if my cars progress
throughout the day.
They said 4pm finish, and my car was finished
washed and waiting for me to collect at 4pm
Would recommend this Audi Dealer.
EXCELLENT SERVICE."
4/18/18,5,"Very hospitable, showed the way to a reception, you tell them why you are there.
You are asked if you would like to wait in the cosey lounge with t.v’s tables and comfy chairs and offered an assortment of drinks and when your car is already and valeted for you are given your keys.
Very pleased with my visit.
Excellent staffxxx"
4/17/18,5,"Seriously good service from Nicole from BMW Cobham. She was extremely professional , courteous , friendly and kind.
Nicole managed to organise a hire car for us when our car needed a new wheel.
She kept us up to date on our car's progress throughout the whole experience.
Nicole also provided us with all the necessary documents and invoices needed .
We were really delighted with the service .
Thanks BMW . Thanks Nicole. Well done."
4/17/18,5,"Car collected from work no problem. Work carried out and car cleaned. Car returned on time. No problems - telephone calls returned and the MOT was cheaper than I thought it would be. Very friendly and
professional. What more can I say.

David Beardmore"
4/17/18,5,"Service and MOT at Mercedes Benz Liverpool.

Customer service was excellent..given courtesy car for the day at no extra cost.

Would highly recommend."
4/17/18,2,"We have purchased brand new cars before but this experience was the low point. All our requests met with resistance / excuses.
On the day of collection the car was not even cleaned properly.
Such a shame that a reputed brand would not care to pay attention towards customer service. There is lots of scope for improvement."
4/17/18,5,Great service from Alan and his team. Car serviced on time and loan car provided by prior arrangement. Reported fault remedied without any issue and car ready on time with phone call to advise job done as promised. Very satisfied customer. Thank you.
4/17/18,5,"Great, attentive and courteous service from Alex Clubley and the team."
4/17/18,2,"Whilst looking for a BMW, first experience, having been recommended by friends, Coopers did not respond to my queries, even though that I made it clear that it was a cash sale.
I purchased my 116i Sport through a dealer in another county!
Moving forward, problems with the Drivetrain, went into Coopers, had my car in for specified problem, was told that it was rectified. It was apparent that it was not on my way to work the following morning. Numerous calls, no response. Not the first time of suffering total lack of communication. Still awaiting response after a further 2 calls. NOT GOOD."
4/17/18,5,Excellent service. My first visit to Cooper Mini in Croydon. I am very satisfied.
4/17/18,5,"Neil Cameron 'stepped in' when a colleague left.

Purchase and delivery process was:
professional, communicated well, accurate, detailed and effortless

Car was picked up 2 weeks before expected date"
4/17/18,5,"Booked my car in as had a safety recall. Brilliant service, work done at time arranged, great professional staff. Thanks."
4/17/18,5,"Really friendly staff, got me a great deal on my service and MOT. Kept me updated throughout. Very happy!"
4/17/18,2,"Booked car in before 8am for MOT & service and was told to come back about 4pm
500yds down the road in courtesy car acrid smoke billowing out of back of car
Given a very nice replacement courtesy car
Back at 4pm service not done yet will be about 6pm! Eventually serviced half an hour later not told of any delay tried to pay by credit card but problem with the card reader the only one on site!
Rushed valet service air freshener canister under seat and alloys not cleaned thoroughly
Overall not a great experience"
4/17/18,5,Just very obliging and pleasant and with a smile at that
4/17/18,5,Very pleased with the service from Inchcape. Rhys was very helpful.
4/17/18,5,"The people here are great, attentive and above all else efficient. Have to say after bad experiences with this dealership several years ago it has changed completely and I've no problems going back there again."
4/17/18,2,"Poor customer service. Booked car in for a service and after telling me that I would receive a video of the service, a printed report stating condition of the car and my service book to be stamped none of these have been provided. I now have the inconvenience of having to return to the garage to have the book stamped and to try and get a printed report. Also and even though they have a fixed service cost the rep quoted me a figure higher than their stated cost, when I challenged this he said he would reduce it.
Second time I’ve had a poor service at Inchcape Stockport and I won’t be returning again."
4/17/18,4,"Noisey waiting area

I think the on line booking and payment system is a excellent idea.

The actual B service took less time than anticipated and I was kept updated via email on completion and paper copy of the report before leaving .

My only gripe was that as I opted to wait in the lounge , I took my computer in the hope that I could do some work . Unfortunately due to the loud music I was too distracted . Would it be possible to have a 'quiet area' for people who genuinely want a little quiet time , maybe just to read the paper?

Apart from the noisey music in the showroom ,everything else was excellent *****"
4/17/18,5,"Really friendly helpful staff, will use them again."
4/17/18,2,"Customer parking appalling. Had to abandon car down a side road as no room in car park.
Kept waiting for 15 minutes to see service representative when dropping car off & 10 minutes when collecting the car.
Inchape did not follow Mercedes procedure for fault code on the diagnostic report."
4/17/18,5,Staff are always very polite and helpful. All work is very efficiently dealt with and car always handed back in lovely condition. My car needed work done under a safety recall (to ensure that the airbag didn’t deploy unsafely). Booking the car in was super easy to do and on the day the job was complete within the hour requested. The dealership also handled an ancillary small repair at the same time without any problem. Very impressive customer service.
4/17/18,5,Routine car service and MOT carried out professionally and with the minimum of inconvenience.
4/17/18,2,"First service for our E220 Coupe, after which engine warning lights were displayed that instructed me to stop driving immediately. Having contacted your service centre, I was left with no option but to cut short my working day to resolve a problem created by a poorly executed Service. Not very impressed with the whole experience and anticipate an acceptable outcome to the conversation on compensation that is yet to be had. I also bought a GLA from this dealership (at the same time as the Coupe) which is due its first service too - I am yet to decide whether I will return to this dealership for servicing or future sales."
4/17/18,5,The services was excellent finished ahead of time price was fair
4/17/18,5,"From the time of collecting of my car in the morning to time of return late afternoon the service was excellent. Driver was courteous,
Engineer gave a thorough report on work carried out and areas which may need attention by video link which was so helpful, finally by no means least was the service advisor who again was very efficient."
4/17/18,5,Very thorough and efficient and front off house staff excellent.
4/17/18,5,I was well prepared ahead of time by a phone call from Inchcape and the oil service took as long as I'd been told it would. I was given a comfortable seat and given a coffee while waiting. The car was valeted to a high standard. A trouble free experience.
4/17/18,5,The usual excellent standard we are used to.
4/17/18,5,"Excellent service, kept me fully aware of progress"
4/17/18,5,"The service that I have received from Coopers has been excellent. I cannot fault the treatment, courtesy and efficiency that I was shown. I was kept updated on progress and my car was returned in immaculate condition with everything in apple pie order. If you need an automotive repair carrying out then look not further than this company. Exceptional."
4/17/18,5,Excellent service and prompt attention.
4/17/18,5,friendly well organised service was quick returning my car in a very clean condition cost was good thanks
4/17/18,5,Wayne was very good and would definitely recommended him.
4/17/18,5,"Great customer experience, friendly, flexible and helpful all through the process - met my expectations."
4/17/18,5,"Great service as always, thanks for sorting me at such short notice."
4/17/18,4,"I had to put my car in for various issues, faults, service etc, and I had Callam looking after my car, who was a credit to the company, polite, dressed impeccably, approachable and not condescending at all, unlike some other car companies, I have dealt with. He explained everything, gave me an estimate as to how much it would cost, and showed me all the necessary functions of the courtesy car.
Unfortunately my visit was let down by a couple of things: booking the car in was a nightmare. I had to wait nearly 3 weeks for a courtesy car, despite my car having a warning light. ( Admittedly I could have got it in sooner, if I didn't need a car ). The lady who booked it in sounded bored and not particularly helpful. She did her job, but didn't really seem interested, at all.I was told that the car would be washed, which it was perfectly, and was told that it would be vacuumed , but it seemed that it was just the carpets. The car went in for a hands free problem, which despite being told there was nothing wrong, it still had the same problem when I got it back as it had when it went in. One of the guys, came out to see the problem, as it was thought that it may have been my phone, but he tried it on his, and to no avail. I have to book it in again. I know that the washing the hovering are done as a courtesy, but perhaps just having it washed would have suited.All in all , I wasn't particulary happy with the service I got except for Callam, who was great."
4/17/18,5,A very efficient and professional experience.
4/17/18,5,"I have has a series of Lexus cars so I expect 5 star service - no complaints, expectations met."
4/17/18,3,Sold me a used car with a boot liner. Forgot to fit boot liner.
4/17/18,5,"Fast, efficient and effective. Great service and excellent communication throughout."
4/17/18,5,"i,ve recently had my car serviced at stockport audi, Normally it would be a slight inconvenience, however i must add that Emma the young lady who came to collect and return my vehicle made the experience pain free.she was extremely professional and polite i am sure that she is an abolute asset to the company and i would highly recomend stockport audi."
4/17/18,5,"I booked my car in for an MOT, and was happily given a courtesy car for the day as I needed to get to work and pick up my daughter. When the car failed the MOT on it's tyres, I was informed in plenty of time and was able to organise an appointment elsewhere for the new tyres, book back into Inchcape 48 hours later, and have the MOT completed in just half an hour.
Great staff, great service - an easy experience all the way!"
4/17/18,5,Excellent customer service provided by Julie in Service Reception and specifically Gareth who provides a personable and attentive service that meets my needs. Both deserve praise and recognition for their attention to costoner engagement.
4/17/18,5,"Very professional. & a very positive experience, which is not always the case for women in garages."
4/16/18,5,Very good customer service but you do pay for it
4/16/18,4,"Booking a service, dropping the car off and collecting the car were all easy. The only disappointing thing was the car valet. All wheels left filthy and body work left to dry smeary. Not what I normally expect."
4/16/18,4,Everything was fine apart from supposed to be 90 minute service and ended up 3 hours which was very disappointing.
4/16/18,5,"I would highly recommend Mini Banstead. Excellent customer service from Alex Daniels. He kept me up to date with how my purchase was going, and couldn’t do enough to help. Made buying a car a lovely experience."
4/16/18,5,"Very professional salesman named Dean. Nothing was too much trouble. Because we were travelling a considerable distance, he provided a video clip and commentary on all aspects of the vehicle before I arranged to view it. Once I decided to purchase the vehicle he was very accommodating in offering to pick me up from the railway station to avoid me taking a taxi. He made sure I was aware of all aspects of operating the controls prior to me leaving the dealership.
The experience was entirely satisfactory."
4/16/18,5,Excellent service
4/16/18,5,"Just had my car serviced at Colchester
Staff in service department were brilliant and very attentive without being pushy.. we were very happy with the whole experience and will definitely be returning .. great vibe when you first walk in too !!"
4/16/18,4,"nice pleasent staff, very courteous, only gripe you dont get anything extra for your money, but i suppose that is audi and not the dealer, all said very pleased with my purchase."
4/16/18,5,Excellent service
4/16/18,5,"Very helpful and knowledgeable staff. In particular, can’t praise Laura highly enough for her advice and help in choosing our new car."
4/16/18,5,"Dropped my car off for MOT at 8.30, then went away for an hour.
When we got back we were told it was complete and being valeted. We were offered tea and coffee while we were waiting.
Staff were professional, friendly and efficient.
Would definitely go back."
4/16/18,5,Very good service and kept informed throughout process
4/16/18,5,"Good reliable check, very impressive, had the check filmed and transferred to my iPhone, brilliant. All clean as well.
Thank you."
4/16/18,5,Excellent service start to finish
4/16/18,5,A slick process and I was kept informed of the progress of my service. The staff are very friendly and accommodating.
4/16/18,3,"Nice enough people, but marked failure to complete fitting tyres properly (twice) means I am dropping their rating. They let an unhappy customer go.."
4/16/18,2,"When you call there is no answer, When I went there in person I waited 20 minutes before anyone came to the front desk. Not happy about that. A company like Mini should be able to staff their branches properly. Only giving an extra star because the staff is friendly."
4/16/18,1,"A bit of a wait but the desk staff were pleasant and helpfull
And even better there was no problem with the car."
4/16/18,5,"excellent service in every way,"
4/16/18,5,"Very slick well oiled system.
Repairs carried out as I would wish.
Pietr was very polite and courteous"
4/16/18,5,"Really lovely team at Swindon Audi. I called about a car and left my name and number and was called nearly straight back to get booked in for a test drive. Long test drive too, I know some car places only allow a small test drive but it was a good test drive route that really gave you a chance to 'drive' the car.

Kevin was the sales rep that dealt with the myself and was so helpful and answered any queries I had. Kevin and his financial manager Dave were able to sort out an affordable monthly cost to myself with a deposit that I was happy to pay.

The car received a service, 12 months MOT and new car mats before I drove it away!!

Overall, a lovely experience from a lovely team :)

Emily Soule"
4/16/18,5,"Courteous, efficient service and very helpful staff."
4/16/18,5,Very professional and informative service. We found it a very easy process purchasing our car here.
4/16/18,5,"Recently returned to Lexus Nottingham after a few years gap with none Lexus cars (regretfully).
Still highly delighted with the care and attention received at this particular Lexus dealership. The staff are courteous and professional from initial reception through to the Service Manager and technicians - faultless !"
4/16/18,2,I would not purchase another vehicle from here...
4/16/18,4,"The only reason I haven't given five stars is that I found out on the day that my service had been booked for first thing, but my MOT was booked for 4pm rather than straight after the service. This wasn't communicated to me when I made the booking. Luckily, the manager was able to shuffle the bookings and move the MOT to 2pm and I had my car back by 3pm. The staff were friendly, attentive and offered refreshments while I waited for the first 30 minutes. The premises were clean and comfortable."
4/16/18,5,Highly recommended!
4/16/18,1,We went to purchase a new Mini Cooper Countryman on Saturday from Mini Cooper Banstead and on arrival were informed that they had just discovered ( half an hour before collection) that the car had no navigation system in it. This is meant to be standard fitting in a Countryman so signifies a major production problem. So no new car . A major let down but today received “a how did we perform email from Inchcape” . Is this good customer service - discuss !
4/16/18,5,Great staff everything was as they said it would be. Danielle was brilliant
4/16/18,4,"A quick telephone call to book in the service but on the day it took half an hour to just drop off the key.
The team kept me informed on progress through the day of the service and completed when they promised."
4/16/18,5,"I have just had my first service at this dealer. The staff were very friendly, the task was carried out in the allotted time. Video footage supplied and there were no problems. I will definitely use again."
4/16/18,5,"Extremely satisfied
The booking process was easy and the staff very helpful. On the day of dropping the car off I was met and the hand over was very smooth. The time that I was told to expect the car back was extremely accurate. On receiving the car, the work was explained. The car washed and ready to go. Very happy with the service received."
4/16/18,5,Had a safety recall. Everything on time. Mechanic Phil did health check and video. Sameera looked after me well and as usual the experience at Inch cape Stockport was superb
4/16/18,5,"excellent service at west london vw (brentford) professional and friendly staff.

however, having been advised that a cambelt is due for renewal, and being advised that as i have a mk7 golf it does not fall under the fixed price service advertised on the vw website of £449 (£499 with waterpump) and was estimated to be around £700, and after being sent the email following the service and mot my car was there for, the email advised me that a cambelt change would actually cost me £1,076.12, needless to say i went looking elshwere and found the job could be done for under £350 especially as there's no guarantee the cambelt would last any longer or there be less of a chance of it breaking if done by vw."
4/16/18,5,"Customer service at this Mini garage in Ipswich is always excellent. Had my mini serviced there last week and couldn't fault it, from the great coffee to the friendly staff and a timely service where they also replaced my brake pads and cleaned the car inside and out. The courtesy car was also a mini convertible which was a nice touch."
4/16/18,5,had a great service assisting my Granddaughter finding a new car and getting her on the road for this Sunday past - thank you.
4/16/18,5,Great service... truly professional and thorough...
4/16/18,5,"The pick up and delivery of my car on the day of the MOT went smoothly and according to plan.I was not in the country on the day so left all arrangements to my daughter.I received a video from the service team, very nice touch I thought. It was a pleasure."
4/16/18,5,Excellent handling from start to finish - great assistance in getting a service appointment and attentive friendly attention at the dealership. The time allocated was met and the return time brought forward. The car was nicely valeted and drove away happy!
4/16/18,4,"Vehicle collection was efficient and on time.
Service carried out in good time and only wiper blades needed as an extra cost
Vehicle returned sparkling clean"
4/15/18,5,Great customer service!
4/15/18,5,I found both the receptionists and advisor quite helpful.
4/15/18,5,"Friendly service. Very thorough and goes the extra mile. When my car was brought back to me after it’s MOT the driver noticed my washer fluid sign was on, so took my car back to get it filled up which I really appreciated."
4/15/18,2,"I can't really comment on the oil and air-con service as I'm not an engineer but there didn't seem to be much work done to justify the cost of £365. It didn't take them long, just 2 hours including valet. It was by far the worst valet I've ever had at a BMW garage with no attempt to clean the leather seats - they were left with muddy marks all over them. £15 at the local shopping centre gets far superior results. Poor."
4/15/18,3,"So generally ok.
The chap I met was fine but my hire car was not ready. When it was brought round the seats were down and it was dirty. Clearly not cleaned from the night before.

Service seemed ok, but 2 of the problems i had were not fixed due to not having the correct CD to upgrade my satnav/media player.

When paying over £40k for a car you expect a little better service and a stock of parts (or CDs).

Not great. Might try Derby next time."
4/15/18,4,"Great service from the staff, a speedy and efficient experience BUT drivers seat and backrest were soaked when I drove away, to the extent that the dampness passed through my jacket to my shirt! Not such a great experience"
4/15/18,5,Very good service with one very minor niggle had to remind them the car was under a service plan.
4/15/18,5,"Great service, friendly and efficient"
4/15/18,5,"I really like and trust this dealership. It restores my faith in car industry customer service. Everyone I have met is really friendly and helpful they will always try and accommodate you. At my yearly service & MOT I feel I get honest technical and customer focused advice unlike the Mercedes dealerships I used in London.
Would highly recommend."
4/15/18,5,Very prompt . Good welcome . Reasonable price
4/14/18,4,"Excellent service. Good staff. Work completed within 2 hours. However I consider £360 a very high price for an oil change, pollen filters and inspection. Not impressed."
4/14/18,5,"We recently purchased an Audi TT from Inchecape used car centre in Burton on Trent...On having some issues with the car we chose not to take it back to Burton, but to use Inchcape Audi in Macclesfield..The service we have been given is second to none. From the first phone call to reception, to dealing with the very friendly service department (Donna and Matt ), we knew we had come to the rite place..We would highly recommend this dealership to anyone who would require an excellent service from a great team...
Gary and Wendy Kirkland...."
4/14/18,5,I have always had excellent service at Malton BMW.
4/14/18,5,"Had a problem with tyres.
Mercedes booked the car in and checked all tyres and gave thewheels a good clean.
Also updated the car so I can use mercedes me.
Very helpful"
4/14/18,5,very well organised and professional
4/14/18,4,"On arrival very quick and friendly attention. The car was taken immediately for its routine servicing and was ready for collection as advised earlier - no delays. The car was clean and presentable having been cleaned over. As far as the servicing and staff attitude is concerned, I would give 5 stars. The only surprise was the expensive cost of the service, it would have been a good idea to enquire after this to avoid the surprise when collecting the car."
4/14/18,5,Had a minor accident requiring body work repair. My car was taken in the next day. I was updated on progress throughout and it was back with me within four working days looking good as new. Very pleased. I've used Cooper Chelmsford's service and body shop facilities for many years now and have always found them to be excellent.
4/14/18,5,"Bought my new car from Tetbury Audi, I have no hesitation in recommending this company"
4/13/18,5,"Thanks to Aaron for going the extra mile and staying a bit later so I could collect my car, and thanks to the cleaning team - it is a different car!"
4/13/18,4,Yes treatment was 1st class regarding initial brake and light problems. Would have given 5 stars if mechanics had looked at engine noise which I highlighted to the service administrator. Car is still tapping which means another visit which takes up time when it all could have been dealt with in one visit.
4/13/18,4,"Car was due for service and 1st MOT Inchcape met me on arrival service details were explained and I was kept informed by video link of part of the work being carried out . Everything was carried out on time and I had no problems only downside was the cost of supplying and fitting of wiper blades was a bit high at £35 compared to having them fitted at say Halfords, but then it is a main VW dealership."
4/13/18,3,"Recently bought a nearly new used mini from them. Service OK, though they wouldn't come down a penny on the price and made me feel like they were doing me a favour when I negotiated an umbrella and a full tank of petrol from them. Not much in the way of good will gestures to make you feel like you've got a good deal or value for for money - they just didn't seem too bothered at all really. Waited around for 1 1/2 hours on pick up day due to their finance department not getting back to them to say my payment had cleared, though they did sort it all out in 24 hours as opposed to the normal 48 hours for me. Also put the wrong address on my ownership docs which is a bit of a pain to send back to the DVLA. Generally quite underwhelmed by the whole experience really - for that kind of money I want to feel like a valued customer which I just didn't."
4/13/18,5,Very good staff helped with appointment and put problem to car right
4/13/18,5,Good attention to detail and took the time that was promised.
4/13/18,1,"No answer on the phones, then put through to service ,no one there.
Disgraceful, I wont be purchasing any new car from you again.
I have purchased 4 cars in the last 2 years."
4/13/18,5,"The booking procedures were excellent with choices on offer
Welcoming friendly staff in the office/showrooms
Comfortable waiting area with free tea and coffee
Free valeting"
4/13/18,5,"Great service from the service department at Cooper BMW Banstead.
Graham and his team can not do enough to make make it a pleasant experience from offering drinks to regular updates on the progress of your car."
4/13/18,5,"I always enjoy a visit to Inchcape at Stockport even though it usually costs me money.
I have always found the staff to be pleasant and extremely helpful and the showroom is very comfortable.
Lots of tea and coffee.
My wife is always very apprehensive when I am in the showroom looking at all the new VWs!
My car is running well after the service and we are looking forward to our drive up to Inverness in the near future.
Keep up the good work."
4/13/18,3,"Car booked in OK for service and warranty work.
Loan car was not clean, smelt like a McDonalds and typically had no fuel.
Promised a call when the work was done and arranged to collect the car at 5pm. Received a call at 16:55 as I was walking into the showroom.
The paid for service was done but the warranty work had not, priorities????
MB declined the warranty - warped discs after 15k miles as this was not a warranty issue!!!! unbelievable .
Promised a call from the Warrington warranty guy today but so far , I suspect he is a busy guy ( which is not a good sign)
Mercedes - never again"
4/13/18,5,I’ve used this company since 2009 and can fund no reason to change garages or my VW motor car. This is my 2nd VW diesel and at my age will make this model last.
4/13/18,4,"This was my first experience of Inchcape Colchester having purchased a new car 12 months ago from another VW dealer. The attending service agent, George, was very polite and did a first class job in signing me in and taking care of providing me with courtesy car promptly.

On a slight negative note, I had reported a small intermittent fault on my car's info system last year but was informed than that ' I would need to prove it', so I asked that it was put on record at Colchester should it recur. I was informed by George, however, that there was nothing mentioned on my file . That was a little disappointing to learn as this fault does still appear from time to time and I do not see why I should have to pay for this if I put the car in for this matter at a later date.

It remains to be seen whether I use Colchester for next service, as I may try Chelmsford in order to gain a comparison on service level."
4/13/18,4,"Work completed on time.Car returned clean and tidy, Good explanation of work carried out,"
4/13/18,5,"excellent service, professional and knowledgeable staff, great customer experience"
4/13/18,5,"Very helpful service staff, particularly Paul who sorted a service plan out for us."
4/13/18,5,Great customer service
4/13/18,5,"Took my vehicle to Cooper Colchester . The service I received from Callum and Alicia in the Service Dept was second to none. Great friendly people, good communication through out."
4/13/18,5,"Every member of staff I spoke with were really helpful and nothing seemed too much to ask for.
They found the faults on my car and cleaned my car. Very helpful and very polite.
I wouldn’t hesitate to take my car back.
Thank you for the nice experience of brilliant customer service."
4/13/18,5,Great service from start to finish and professional and friendly staff at Cooper malton
4/13/18,4,"Good service, would like a quicker turnaround on drop off if possible.
Also price is very high - would like some kind of lower tariff for long clients."
4/13/18,5,Good service by all today
4/13/18,5,I visited MB to return my car for a recall. The booking service was excellent and my treatment on the day was very courteous and polite. The work was completed on time and I'm glad my car was given a clean bill of health.
4/13/18,3,"Staff at Cooper BMW Tunbridge Wells are pleasant and helpful, although no more so than other local main dealers (and not as good as our local VW dealer who we also use regularly).

The main problem is their prices, which are high. To diagnose and replace a faulty NOx sensor was almost £650. While these sensors aren’t cheap, I’m pretty sure I could have got the work done for substantially less elsewhere. Will check out independent BMW specialists."
4/13/18,3,"Sent car in because alarm kept going off when locked and bonnet up warning light constantly on. Advised problems might be linked and that the bonnet micro switch might be causing the problem. Charged £136.00 to investigate and further £100 plus to fit parts, Total £399.00 all for about 1 hours work plus inexpensive parts. Arrived with vehicle at 09.45 and had to wait until 4.15pm!

Vehicle given ""Health Check"". I was advised that exhaust was leaking and that it would not pass MOT. They wanted £826.00 to fix. Took it to two other independent garages, both said only a pin hole, nothing to worry about and that it would not fail MOT as emissions were ok. Also told that pin hole could be fixed with very simple weld.

Feel that Mercedes Coventry are trying to rip me off. They have always serviced the car, but now thinking seriously of going elsewhere"
4/13/18,1,"Bought car with 1300 miles on clock was told it was immaculate, delivered with two herbed wheels, stone chipped headlight and 2 steamed up headlights! Not whats expected for £27k pics sent 3 days on no offer of help to repair the car just ""Talking to manager about maybe fixing one wheel"" RUBBISH"
4/13/18,5,"Extremely satisfied with experience with the service department at Inchcape Toyota at Burton. Greeted on entering showroom and shown to the service counter, the service advisor explained everything that would be done and then went through the operation of the courtesy car , before leaving I was asked if I wanted a complimentary wash and vacuum on my car. Many Thanks Inchcape Burton"
4/13/18,5,"Very easy, quick and efficient."
4/12/18,5,"I can not speak highly enough of East Kent Audi, especially the sales executive Laura. From the moment I walked in to the showroom to the minute I left with my car, she went above and beyond to make sure I got the car I wanted and was always kept in contact letting me know where my car was and if I had any questions with weekly emails.

I want to thank Claire and especially Laura for their excellent service. I am over the moon with my car and couldn't be happier. Am definitely recommending you to everyone looking for a new/ used car"
4/12/18,5,The guy in your Parts Dept couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant to deal with (and the part couldn't have arrived faster).
4/12/18,1,"Not impressed , car was sat in car park an hour before the workshop decided to start work, a very lengthy 3 1/2 hr work for a simple safety recall!"
4/12/18,5,Staff went the extra mile
4/12/18,5,"I booked my annual service with Inchcape over the internet. I had the option of a slot the next day but this was not convenient for me and I chose a date about a week away. A reassuring email arrived promptly. I asked for the car to be collected from my home and returned there. This all went very smoothly - the polite and friendly driver phoned before collection and again before returning the car. The car was returned in good condition, and very clean inside and out. There was a clear report on the car's condition with the returned paperwork. The service was rounded off by a courtesy call to check that all was well."
4/12/18,5,Polo subject to safety recall. (Towing eye). Very easy to book in for the remedy. Excellent service which included free visual inspection (video emailed) and car valet. Mentioned a minor problem with my wife's Tiguan and was invited to bring in next day. Problem solved. Well done Naomi!
4/12/18,2,Advised 30k was major service and I couldn't wait for my car as it would take too long. The only major thing was the price. Twice as much as other garages. Told brake fluid change due in two months when I picked the car up but not when I dropped it off. I won't be back.
4/12/18,5,"Excellent level of service and attention to detail.
Quality product reflected by the professional staff who offer a customer experience which is second to none."
4/12/18,5,"Been in for recent recall on my c class coupe,it couldn't have gone any better,very professional outfit at inchcape kidlington oxford,even gave my car a valet! Very pleased indeed."
4/12/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish. Done all they could to service car and have ready by the time I requested.
4/12/18,5,Great attention to detail - and kept informed - would recommend highly.
4/12/18,5,Excellent service.
4/12/18,5,"Very professional, work carried out within expected timescale kept up to date re progress excellent staff and service."
4/12/18,5,"Totally reccommend! Nothing but pleasure working with these people, Adam Harrod sold me a car that I picked up Tuesday, he was so helpful and made the whole process so easy and enjoyable"
4/12/18,1,"DISGUSTING !!! Basically held hostage until I paid for something that I shouldn’t have. No customer service at all terrible, avoid at all costs"
4/12/18,5,"Efficient service on the day and the service manager was very good at rectifying my situation so that I was happy. The information I was given on booking was wrong and the time of my appointment had been changed without anyone notifying me, however the service manager made sure that my car was ready for me in the time slot that I had originally been given."
4/12/18,5,"Very helpful and welcoming staff, efficient and easy to understand service experience. Will be returning."
4/12/18,5,"Exceptional service, I’ve bought many Mercedes cars but this time the service i received from a Thomas was first class - thank you"
4/12/18,4,Darren provided the upmost customer service to me with in depth knowledge & expertise. Very happy customer
4/12/18,3,Was promised the car was going to be washed and valeted and wasn't
4/12/18,5,"Amazing experience with Audi ,did get to understand our needs from first moment .
Sam A (the gentleman)he was amazing person very professional and friendly (if we could we will give him a 10 star rate.
We will definitely recommend Audi and Sam A for our friends and relatives."
4/12/18,5,"I had my first experience of VW Inchcape Cheltenham and I have to say it was superb from start to finish. Everybody that I came into contact with was totally focused on delivering the best customer service. As I was waiting for my car to be serviced, I had the opportunity to listen and observe and every customer was treated in the same delightful manner. Special mention to Angela, who dealt with me and the lady on reception who went out of her way to make people feel welcomed and kept them informed throughout. Well done all!!"
4/12/18,5,Exemplary service from booking through to completion and vehicle return
4/12/18,5,Brilliant service. Picked car up and dropped off and time they said! Car was spotless when it come back. I will always shop at Audi because of the quaility and service
4/12/18,5,Works were completed to a good level and a full explanation of the works undertaken together with a supporting video was provided. Ben Lempriere who served me was very helpful and kept me informed of the works progress as I was waiting for my car. The customer office facilities provided on the upper floor was well equipped and allowed me to works whilst I was waiting for my Vehicle.
4/12/18,5,"Car services do not get better than this.
After buying our Tiguan from Inchcape VW and having a good experience, we made a point of going back for the first service, despite being more than 40 miles away.
Pleased to report we were not disappointed and plan to use Inchcape in future.
Well done Team Inchcape!"
4/12/18,4,"To be fair, 4 stars doesn't quite seem enough, and 5 just a tiny bit too many. My review is of the whole experience, so covers the communication from BMW and the dealership too.

Both were really good, in particular the gentleman from the dealership, who couldn't have been more friendly, polite and (importantly) knowledgeable.

My only criticism is that the communication that came direct from BMW, and what I subsequently received from the dealership, in terms of what stage of the process the car was at, and when it was likely be delivered, didn't always (100%) go hand in hand.

A minor quibble, as I would usually prefer to have too much communication than to little (and this was much better than when I purchased an Audi 12 months or so ago), but that's the difference between a 4.5 and a 5.0....."
4/12/18,5,"Excellent, attentive service from reception staff, Service supervisor from delivery of the vehicle to pick up"
4/12/18,5,Jamie-Lee was excellent in her communication. Friendly staff and was made very comfortable for my short wait. Thank you.
4/12/18,5,Excellent customer service from my first enquiry to the hand over of my new BMW X6 especially like to thank Oliver Gutierrez for his friendly and professional approach.
4/12/18,5,"Excellent as always, most helpful and informative."
4/12/18,3,could be better but all issues were resolved in the end so thanks
4/12/18,4,"Great service from friendly approachable staff.
Car was serviced within the timescale originally stated. Car was valeted within that time also."
4/11/18,5,"Very efficient & friendly service, Victoria was extremely helpfully. Couldn’t have asked for more. Would definitely return 😊"
4/11/18,5,"Excellent service from Charlotte and other showroom staff at Cooper Mini Durham.
Options clearly explained, paperwork sorted efficiently and car ready for collection at agreed time & date."
4/11/18,5,"There is always a warm welcome here - pleasant, and smiling receptionists and excellent coffee!
A loan car had been made available for me but, when I was told the work would take only 3 - 4 hours, I decided to walk to the shops and leave the car for someone else's use.
True to their word, I received a call after just 3 hours that my car was ready for me. It had been thoroughly cleaned, inside and out and I drove away a very happy customer!"
4/11/18,5,Brilliant service Michael taylor and sam axhija both went above and beyond in helping me purchase my car. Even when the finance company didnt release the funds they both went out of thier way to get it sorted asap so i could get the vehicle amazing service very polite and extremely helpful
4/11/18,5,"Quick, professional and courteous"
4/11/18,4,"No issues with the MOT experience as such.....well looked after as usual....comfortable waiting area with good coffee.....but Inchcape has not reacted to the difficulties on arrival in finding a parking space....customers driving in circles looking for a space....and now cones blocking off access to the used vehicle display area where numerous spaces were available....the issue needs addressing !

Philip"
4/11/18,5,Outstanding service from start to finish!
4/10/18,4,"excellent service started from booking the appointment to the collection of the car after the service. would use again.
Polite and welcoming staff at the reception"
4/10/18,5,"Friendly, approachable, happy and honest front of house staff.
Denise who dealt with my MOT arrival and departure was a real people person who made you feel relaxed.
A good experience"
4/10/18,3,"My review is based upon after sales service at the Norwich, Norfolk showroom. I really want to give 2.5 stars. Without boring you with specifics, to say we are really disappointed with the after sales service is an understatement. The car is only just over a year old, wasn't cheap as you know and yet when I have had to call in for assistance I actually feel invisible. I actually dread going in there. They should at least acknowledge me if only to let me know they have seen me. Believe me, I smile, I hang back (just courteously) when they are on the phone and wait for them to acknowledge me, but you know what - I could still be there now if I didn't purposely make a point of saying ""excuse me - can you help""? I really get the feeling they don't like their job and that they certainly don't want to help me - yet another customer, what could I possibly want now? It really gets so that I don't want to have to contact them for anything, they have advised me to call LandRover assist on more than one occasion - as they won't be able to 'book me in' for weeks!!!! When we are approached for renewing the car, it's highly unlikely we will do so - purely based on their after sales care. Having spent that amount of money, I'd hope to feel a little bit more important to them. Such a shame. We absolutely had no problem with the initial purchase of the car, it's the continuing after care that is letting them down."
4/10/18,5,As usual excellent service from the staff at reading mini full service and a cleaned car thank you
4/10/18,2,"18 month old golf in for failed central locking on drivers door, warranty repair. Diagnosis & actual repair work all fine.
Only problem was with the time it takes them between me turning up at reception on time & getting a taxi to work! One whole hour to drop off the keys is excessive, especially when I’m paid by the hour!
Staff are always very polite, but the whole process is too SLOW! Then at pick up, half an hour before I got the keys back."
4/10/18,5,"Excellent service. This is the 3rd car I have had from Crawley Audi.
They always beat any other price from any other Audi dealer"
4/10/18,4,A really good experience from the moment we walked into the showroom. That salesperson was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the car and made a complex trade-in deal seem very easy.
4/10/18,5,"My car had recall on it. So arranged for it to be collected from home and dropped off at my work, car came back valeted and a free health check had been performed and video sent to my email. Can't fault customer service."
4/10/18,5,"Excellent, friendly customer service.
One recommendation would be that when a car is ready for collection, if the reception desk is informed, then they could confirm immediately, rather than having to be put through to the service desk who are normally very busy."
4/10/18,5,"Customer service was excellent, you are informed of all the details regarding your car. You are given a time for when the work is complete and it was. Excellent service."
4/10/18,4,"Everything went as well as on all previous services at Leicester Inchcape. Courteous and efficient booking in procedure and a curtesy call to that the car was finished and just being washed.
But when we looked over the service documents, we noticed it been had indicated that 3 alloy wheels were scratched.
We went to look where the scratches were but could not see any. To our disappointment found that the wheels and tyres had not been washed or the tyres blacked. We sought the advice of our booking in representative, who came out and confirmed that there were no scratches and apologised for the oversight of not treating the wheels."
4/10/18,5,Excellent customer focused company with great people working for them.
4/10/18,5,"Excellent service always, I have been with Mercedes Inchcape for a few years now and every time my car goes in for MOT service etc the car and I are both treated with great care and attention."
4/10/18,3,"The customer service reception were very helpful, however, I had to wait quite a few weeks for an appointment whereby a loan car was available.
My car was meant to be returned washed and hoovered. The quality of this was appalling and I paid to get it done myself the day after. The interior mats had not been lifted to hoover and mud had not been wiped off the door sills. It was a very shoddy job, not at all what I would expect from BMW."
4/10/18,4,"Process was very efficient with good updates provided. was in for first service and obviously thinking about future occasions also. expected valeting/car wash, which was carried out but...........boot space was missed!"
4/10/18,5,"amazing service from louise, she was amazing and made me feel so welcome. Would 100% go back again."
4/10/18,5,excellent service. I liked the video showing the state of the underneath of the car showing any problems. Because of timetable problems on my part I couldnt book a courtesy car when I could get to the garage and I was offered a lift home which was very convenient. They all went the extra mile!
4/10/18,5,I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED FOR THE JOB DONE BY MINI COOPER STAFF IN COBHAM.
4/10/18,5,Sandhurst Toyota couldn’t have been more helpful didnt feel like a number felt like a customer should felt
4/10/18,5,"Great service, did everything as per service schedule and additional items requested."
4/10/18,5,"Excellent Customer service, was dealt with by Victoria Binington. She knew everything about the car and services, kept me up to date throughout the day on my cars progress. If you are looking to either buy, service your car with BMW/ Mini Cooper ask for Victoria for the best experience."
4/10/18,5,Dealership very helpful and friendly. Only improvement would have been if they had called me during the day to let me know how my car was rather than me having to call them to find out.
4/10/18,5,Very easy and professional to deal with and no issues with the work carried out.
4/10/18,5,"Amazing customer service, I always come away knowing that my car has been serviced by great technicians, at a fair price and always in the time stipulated.

Kind regards
Peter Downey"
4/10/18,5,"Thanks for your attention yesterday with the service and other checks on my vehicle
Special mention to Frank
excellent"
4/10/18,5,Excellent and prompt service. Would be happy to use their services again.
4/10/18,3,"They don’t pick up the telephone.

Long wait in reception to pick up car and drop it off."
4/10/18,5,"Very good helpful service,salesman Chris Mayes took time to answer all my questions and went through the controls and features when I picked my car up ."
4/10/18,5,First time having the car serviced and went like clockwork. In and out with courtesy car within 10 minutes and same again later in the day when collecting our car. Everyone pleasant and professional and nothing at all to find fault in.
4/10/18,4,The parking could be improved
4/10/18,1,"Terrible service, always looking to make money out of you for no reason but not actually fixing anything."
4/10/18,5,Fantastic service
4/10/18,5,"Stepped out off my comfort zone to buy a car i had not seen on line through Inchcape Audi. The whole process of buying a car I had not seen plus them taking mine in part exchange which they had not seen was an experience to look back on and think yes I did the right thing. Dealing with professional and friendly staff I was guided through the process expertly to the car arriving on my doorstep. The car was was everything and more than the detailed video portrayal a pleasure to behold, first car to put a smile on my face for years. I would'nt be afraid to deal with Inchcape audi again."
4/10/18,5,Excellent service and customer care. I can recommend this VW dealership.
4/10/18,3,I Had initial problems booking a service in and after 3 phone calls finally it was booked. I then called back a week late to check the date where I was told it wasn't booked in! I was then on the phone for 9 minutes to finally be told it was booked in and confirmed the date. This is not the level of service I was expecting and if I had a choice I would not use Mercedes nor would I recommend them
4/10/18,5,"I travelled from Greenock to Durham to pick up my 2 year old 5 series M Sport Touring. Phil couldn't have been more helpful, sending me a video of the car inside and out. He said he would point out any imperfections in the video but there weren't any. It was as stunning and unmarked as I was told.
Staff couldn't have been more welcoming.
Very Happy Customer."
4/9/18,2,"So I drop the car off for it first service, so far so good. So I sit & wait , & wait . Eventually I get impatient & ask the desk how is my service is going, after a few minutes out come the agent and tells me she text my wife that the car was ready half an hour earlier ! Why I asked when It was me that handed over the car...... no real answer just waffle. More of the usual from the Chester Branch. Customer service is awful here and has been from day one, of all the new cars we have bought our merc expensive is by far the worst"
4/9/18,5,Really nice people and not pushy very helpful especially Asif nothing was too much if you want a mini go and see them first .
4/9/18,5,Went shopping for new mini for the daughter we test drove a Mini Cooper 1.5 petrol auto which was 11 years younger than her car (2007) really impressed and quite surprised by the difference the mini had matured well more comfortable more toys a nice place to be back to mini Durham with Tito our friendly and very knowledgeable salesman 10/10 couldn’t catch him out on anything he and his again very friendly colleagues put a great deal together and we would pick up the mini in a weeks time The deal and the general attitude of Tito and the staff enticed me into doing another deal for a manual cooper for the other daughter.Big thanks Tito
4/9/18,2,"I bought my Mini Countryman in for a service. I was told it would take 90 minutes so I elected to wait. When I arrived I was told it would be 90 mins plus 20 mins for the clean ... after 2 hours I check the status of my car - after 2 hours and 50 mins my car was returned, washed on the outside with a very cursory vacuum inside but definitely not cleaned! A very frustrating and disappointing experience."
4/9/18,2,Very disappointed that after spending over £300 on a service my vehicle was not cleaned. I was then told it would be done straight away if I waited. 45 minutes later it was still not done in the same parking bay.
4/9/18,5,"I recently took my car to Inchcape Liverpool for a Service. They were excellent. Prompt service, efficient, friendly and informative. Gary the customer liaison was excellent, very helpful and courteous. The short video of the inspection of my car was an added bonus."
4/9/18,5,The team at Tetbury Audi did an excellent job and I would recommend them to anyone interested in buying an Audi. Will Jarvis was very good in ensuring I knew all the information about the car and options re finance and other insurances.
4/9/18,5,"I’ve been a customer of Audi Crawley for 10 years, nothing is too much trouble. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for great customer service"
4/9/18,1,"Disgusting service , would highly recommend everyone to give a very wide steer! This review is for VW Harold Wood Colchester road .
I have had nothing but aggravation and lies from this company, please don’t take your custom to this dealership"
4/9/18,5,"Interacted with a lovely gentleman called Frank. Friendly and informative. All done at ease, kept me informed and done within an agreed timescale."
4/9/18,5,"Excellent service from phone call to book my car in ,reception desk on arrival , a coffee while I discussed with the service guy what I needed to be checked , left my car with them , had a text to say my car was ready to collect . My car was also given a health check ,plus a wash and vac . What more would an owner want a Mercedes showroom and service centre , I would certainly recommend."
4/9/18,5,Collected car from home and delivered back. Kept me up to date. Even to the point of letting me know that the car had arrived there.
4/9/18,5,"Purchased a Range Rover Sport from Inchcape in Kings Lynn.
The whole process was very smooth and the service provided was truly excellent.
Highly recommended."
4/9/18,5,"Excellent friendly, welcoming and efficient"
4/9/18,5,"very efficient service ,waited while they carried out express option ,washed car as well in about an hour ."
4/9/18,5,How welcoming it is to still be treated courteously and respectfully. Everything explained clearly and your feedback listened to. Restores anyone's faith in corporate human nature.
4/9/18,5,I found the staff courteous and very professional. The service was completed swiftly and communication was efficient and clear.
4/9/18,5,"On Saturday, I urgently required to have a burst tyre replaced.
The staff were able to fit a new tyre although people had already
booked their cars in for servicing.
The service was marvellous and Connor, who looked after me
was exceptional-thank you BMW."
4/9/18,3,"Very friendly staff both on reception and the service desk.
Car in for a recall problem and to have the emissions patch completed - no issues to date with the work completed however I was informed that the car had been valeted ( A complimentary service).
The car had definitely not been valeted however the passenger seat had been moved back and there was moisturiser from a plastic bottle on the mat in the foot well."
4/9/18,5,"Highly recommend.

From the minute we stepped into Audi Cheshire Oaks, we were greeted by a lovely receptionist who arranged for someone to look after us. We were then greeted by Tony who listened to our requirements and talked us through everything. After test driving our car and discussing the finance (without being pressurised), we signed the deal. An absolute pleasure and would certainly recommend Tony and the team at Audi Cheshire Oaks. We are totally in love with our new car."
4/9/18,5,"Had a great experience buying my new mini convertible, had the car within a few days and the service received is amazing , already recommended them to my family who are looking to purchase minis, I big thank you to Grace who dealt with everything and made the situation as least stressful as possible
Thank you so much!"
4/9/18,5,"& there was no pressure to do anything more. I decided to go ahead & was looking at 2 cars at this site with a possible 3 more at another, I was told if one from the other site was my preference it would be transported for me to view to save me having to drive further. The 2 cars locally looked similar, but one was a much higher spec & £3000 dearer. Only the cheaper car was available for inspection, as the other was being prepared, so I would have needed to return to view it. On balance I decided the cheaper would suit the amount & type of driving I do, & whilst all the whistles & bells would have been nice, I would not in all honesty used that often. At no time did I feel any pressure from the salesperson to go for the more expensive model or indeed to buy at all."
4/9/18,5,Fab service from the minute I walked thru the door. The receptionist was very friendly and polite and the customer waiting area was a pleasure to wait in.
4/9/18,5,"Easy to set up appointment, Work was excellent and on time plus i stayed at Coopers Reading while the work was done and could carry on with my work in a very comfortable environment"
4/9/18,4,The purchase of my new car went smoothly once it had arrived at Cheshire Oaks Audi. I was very pleased with the manner in which Henry carried out the transaction and associated paperwork.
4/9/18,5,Smooth process from booking of appointment to collection of car
4/9/18,4,"A couple of minor points prevent me giving 5 stars, but apart from that, I would highly recommend Mercedes Stratford-upon-Avon."
4/9/18,5,Excellent customer service. Collected and returned car with works carried out and corrected.
4/9/18,5,Helpful advice in finding us the car we wanted and we ended up happy with the purchase was completed.
4/9/18,5,"Courteous as ever. The fault needed a concerted effort by several staff, and appears to be overcome. Fairly charged."
4/9/18,5,"Great customer Service, easy to deal with quick and pleasant transaction."
4/9/18,5,"Great team of people, went above and beyond to make sure the car had everything it needed or didn’t need, everything was explained so no unexpected bill at the end,"
4/9/18,2,"Cooper Croydon carried out the 3 year pre MOT warranty check on Friday 23rd March. At the time of booking I advised that the START STOP hadn't worked for quite sometime. They had the car for over 9 hours, it wasn't valeted, nor could the advisor tell me what percentage was now in the battery following them putting it on charge. In my view if the battery had degraded to an extent that it wasn't charging enough to operate the start stop, then it should be replaced. However I was told by the Service Agent this would not be changed. I took the phone number of the BMW Customer Care Team and rang speaking to MARK as soon as I was home. I then had to chase speaking to NATHANIEL, SARAH and lastly DEBBIE, all across a 2 week period. They all said they had either emailed or spoken to the Service Manager at Cooper Croydon, MATTHEW CULLEN. It appears that he was too busy to speak to me across that 2 week period, he also felt that it was an acceptable time for a customer to wait for a response from him, even though I had rung in, again! He confirmed what the Service Agent had advised me, and then said he didn't expect me to understand but that they do have analytics from the diagnostics they extract. Would he have said that to a gentleman? I would suggest not. All in all, Matthew is unconcerned and uninterested in dealing with a customer that isn't content. Cheerio BMW, I will not be returning."
4/9/18,4,"Waited a little in reception, but was met by Dean who was very helpful with full explanations and informative chat. Service carried out well and on time, however car was not vacuumed as per the usual courtesy / compliment."
4/9/18,5,Great Friendly service from all Mercedes Staff we encountered
4/9/18,4,"The only problem with the service and parts department you are met by perplex cubes, with the staff hiding in the back offices. They then have to notified by another member of staff that you are waiting. Only car dealership that the staff are not available."
4/9/18,4,"Service department always offers excellent service.
New car sales need to improve their customer service."
4/9/18,5,excellent professional service
4/9/18,5,Quick easy nothing to much Trouble
4/9/18,5,"Outstanding service. My car (318i) was in for recall work, all FOC due to warranty. Also, they carried out a free health check, whilst sending a 2min video of the engineer carrying out the report (nice touch).

BMW Cooper Reading kindly provided me with a 335D X-Drive for the day and didn’t quibble about anything...

James in their service department certainly did BMW justice on their service levels.

Car went in first thing in the morning (8am) and collected same day (5:30pm) and had a complimentary wash.

5* service as expected from BMW."
4/9/18,5,"Excellent service. Very happy with every stage of the ordering process and the car was delivered much earlier than expected. Ashod, was very helpful and responsive throughout. A pleasure to deal with."
4/9/18,5,Very professional and helpful service. The delivery of the car took longer than expected however we were kept up to date with its progress throughout.
4/9/18,5,Traveled from Essex to Nottingham for both purchase and service of my car. That must tell you its worth the time and petrol to come to them. Martin was fab and dealt with me straight away. I even got a car wash and vac thrown in when I was not expecting it. Shame not all dealerships are like this one!
4/9/18,5,Superb customer service and fantastic attention to detail. This was my second visit to Audi Macclesfield & I will be returning for all my future Audi needs.
4/9/18,4,"I tried to book my service online but I think there's a bug in the online process so I ended up calling instead. Apart from that everything went smoothly. I was kept informed as to the status of the service (I had booked a while-you-wait service) and everything was explained to me afterwards in language I could understand. Everyone I dealt with was friendly and helpful.

I wanted to give 4.5 stars really. The half star is lost because of the Main Dealer price for a service and VW HQ's lack of a sense of humour. I had reported the bug I found on their website and cheekily asked if they might take a few quid off my service for my efforts - 'Hutzpah' as I believe it's called. The response was very curt and humourless - ""Thank you for your email. We will see you on the day for your service"". I don't think it was an automated reply but it felt like it. Not Inchcape's fault though."
4/9/18,5,Great service. Friendly and professional staff dealt with everything efficiently as always. Thank you
4/9/18,5,Excellent customer service staff were helpful friendly top marks
4/9/18,1,"I received appalling service from Audi Maidstone last Friday. My car was booked in for a service and MOT and was collected from my workplace. I emphasised my car would need to be back with me by 5:00pm and was they reassured me that it would be returned much sooner than this. By 4:30pm I tried calling Audi Maidstone, could not get any answer on any of their landlines, I had 2 colleagues trying also on separate lines and none of us could get through! We tried all options, sales, service, parts - none picked up in fact 1 line was and they hung up immediately! Eventually Emily called me to say she was calling to take payment before she would release my car - this was at 5:30pm, I explained that my car should have been back with me half an hour ago! I paid over the phone and my car finally arrived at 6:00pm which caused me all sorts of problems being an hour late for my appointment on Friday evening. On Saturday morning when I drove my car the a warning appeared telling me underinflated, check all 4 tyres which I did report to them and asked to check at the service and they again assured me this would be sorted. I called Audi on Saturday morning, I called again Monday morning and I am still waiting for a return call from Emily (it is now Monday afternoon). It is a disgraceful service - well in fact no service at all"
4/9/18,5,Car picked up and dropped off no problems. great video review giving useful information. All in all very good service
4/9/18,2,"Too long waiting to be dealt with. Car not clean on return, it was not washed completely. Usually my car is also valeted but not this time. Who checked it before returning?"
4/9/18,5,"Great service received from Cooper Tonbridge, in particular the friendly pick up and delivery drivers."
4/9/18,5,Excellent service from VW Exeter
4/9/18,4,"First experience with Inchcape Chelmsford, all good, they are clearly working hard to provide quality service. Happy to return for the next service."
4/9/18,5,"Staff in there are so kind and helpful.
I went to change the Wipers and didn't need to wait as a quick service to run.

Thank you"
4/8/18,3,"Phone message not passed on. Service staff not phoning back. If nobody on reception, other staff just ignore you. I felt service staff just bluffing when the vehicle had to go in for a third time to fix a fault. A general attitude of the customer isn’t always right."
4/8/18,5,Very good service
4/8/18,1,"Difficult customer experience.

1) Didn't apply service pack and expected me to pay more than the agreed price
2) They do not return phone calls - expect to invest huge amounts of time to get them to respond.
3) They do not uphold their promises
4) Still 3 years after buying my car I am waiting for their General Manager to call me back. Even after I received a sales call - I said I'd consider dealing with them again if their Regional or General.Manager called to apologise. They never did."
4/8/18,3,"Bought a 35mth old used BMW 1 Series from BMW Norwich in Mar 18. Vehicle in good shape and generally pleased with it. Handover brisk and rather cursory but no helpful Information about after-sales or warranty given or offered. Subsequent enquiry by email was not helpful so contacted BMW(UK) for advice and information on this.

There has been no post sales follow up from the dealer (now 3 wks post purchase)

Having bought 7 BMW cars and 3 BMW motorcycles from various main dealers in England and Scotland over 15-20 yrs, I have a reasonable experience of the marque and have calibrated my customer expectations as a result of that. This experience doesn’t quite match the level of service I’ve become accustomed to."
4/8/18,2,"I took my car into youre service dept on 4th Aprilm for its first service, being told when making the booking it would have a wash and valet.
On arriving at the reception at 09:00 with my 5 yr old grandson asked if we could have a ride to the coach station, was told it had already gone,

On completion later in the afternoon to collect the vehicle, found it had
neither wash nor valet.
When reporting back to the service advisor recieved no response. ."
4/7/18,5,Great customer service
4/7/18,1,"I only went to Leicester Mercedes to have my car serviced
I will never buy a car from Leicester branch
Loughborough and Chesterfield branches much better
2 Of The LEICESTER car salesmen were rude ,ignorant and couldn’t care less
They do not have a clue about various models and specifications
Wasted two months for these salesman to find me a car
Went to Loughborough and got what I wanted on the first visit"
4/7/18,1,"An unacceptable service that damages prestige brands.

I recently had my Range Rover Sport serviced at Kings Lynn, when it came back it had a fault with the suspension. I booked in for another pickup to resolve and at 5.30 the evening before pickup I was left a message saying they weren’t coming, no follow up, and no attempt to rearrange.

I was also informed that it had corrosion on the wheels although it was now a few days (3) outside of warranty and was not covered.

Every single service I’ve had they have kept the car for one more day than planned and despite a full engine failure at 18,000 miles I have always been very accommodating.

Is this poor quality product from LandRover or poor service from Inchcape or sadly, both!

Added Note: They ask me to email them but despite that not a single attempt to resolve the issues."
4/7/18,3,"I think the service use to be much better at Cooper but this time not too happy , after few phone calls and follow up when I picked up my car after body work , service and MOT which took about 24 days! its cleaness condition was not up to BMW standard."
4/7/18,5,Excellent service over many years. The service dept. keep you informed throughout the service. They collect and deliver the car back to me and it always been cleaned.
4/7/18,3,"I made booking at Coopers Colchester for a new tyre fitting for 10:15 on 5/4/18. I arrived and checked in, and within a few minutes was told that the wrong tyre had been delivered, and I would need to come back later in the day at about 14:30. Not a good start. I came at the suggested time and was prepared to wait for 45minutes to an hour. After 90 minutes I checked on what was happening and was told the car was nearly ready. It was almost 2 hours when I received my keys back. Why was the delivery not checked for the correct tyre, so I could be contacted . Why does it take nearly 2 hours to change one tyre, I accept that the car was washed and vacced. I have used Coopers for many years for servicing etc and have always been pleased with the service received, but I will be looking at Kwit-Fit or Blackcircles in future for tyres and they are cheaper."
4/7/18,5,"Very pleased with the service I had on my car, staff very helpful and friendly, made us very welcome, and would recommend them."
4/7/18,5,"The first time I have used Malton for my BMW servicing, EXCELLENT"
4/6/18,5,"First class service, quick clean and tidy great job. Thanks"
4/6/18,5,"The service provided was excellent from booking, vehicle collection, MOT testing and vehicle valet and return."
4/6/18,5,"Always Excellent service everytime i book my car in for a service. Nothing is ever to much of a bother, car is always valeted and ready on time for collection. Very friendly and welcoming staff who always acknowledge me by my name when I arrive."
4/6/18,3,"Very rushed experience. Car was in and out in time, but had a very cold greeting from Lisa, no smile etc., and being told to hurry as she had 'another customer already waiting' leads me to want to take my car elsewhere. I asked her to take a look at a few concerns I had with the car, but she didn't seem to comprehend what I was asking (poor technical knowledge?), and seemed baffled why I hadn't mentioned them at time of booking."
4/6/18,5,"What can I say, as usual an excellent service and the team were very helpful and obliging especially the very friendly gentleman who came to fetch the car and as we said to him when he left - see you next year.

Celia Field"
4/6/18,2,"Service was carried out as per Mercedes recommendation. Car was cleaned inside and out and returned in good condition with appropriate paperwork.
Dealership customer parking ridiculous, no room to park or manoeuvre.
Long wait to book in car even though was pre booked and paid on line. The person that eventually came to obtain my key was obviously inexperienced and had very little knowledge of Mercedes systems and procedures. Could not answer my questions regarding Mercedes Me App and gave me misleading information regarding service by non Mercedes main dealers.
Overall impression, not the professional service one would expect from a supposedly prestigious automotive brand. Unfortunately Inchcape are the only Mercedes dealership in Coventry, so competition is non existant."
4/6/18,5,Well organised service with helpful staff and everything completed on time: a pain less experience apart from the cost.
4/6/18,5,"Arranging cars service was easy and quickly accomplished.
Confirmation sent after booking and reminder emails sent 24 hours before service.
Dropped car off at approx. 08:15 hrs, booking in carried out very quickly.
Video of under car and tyre inspection sent. Text message received to advise car ready to pick up. Attended to straight away when arrived to pick car up. Service work and record sheet discussed. Overall a very efficient operation, staff very friendly and efficient."
4/6/18,5,Very impressed with customer service and the service provided
4/6/18,5,"Excellent friendly service & aftercare from Adrian. The coffee is good as well! 😃

In terms of the car a 3.5 year motor was sold in fabulous condition."
4/6/18,5,"Very happy with service provided by Mini Cooper for my car's MOT & End of Warranty check. I always the staff , particularly Hollie, friendly and helpful"
4/6/18,5,"The whole experience was straightforward and stress free. Best car purchase I have had to date. Special thank you for Michael Deo for his professionalism and making the process smooth, he’s a pleasure to deal with and I will recommend him to my friends and family.

Tony Fox"
4/6/18,5,"When visiting Cooper Reading BMW, I knew exactly what I wanted and did not want to be sold something different. Once Matt Gilbert knew what I was looking for, he went out of his way to secure the vehicle and ensure that the sale went through as quickly and efficiently as possible. His genuine interest in his client, and attention to every part of the sale was excellent and I would recommend Cooper Reading to anyone wishing to purchase a used BMW."
4/6/18,2,"I unfortunately hit a pot hole on my way to work, which totally flattened the tyre. So had to use Mini Assist for the first time. On the first phone call, I waited 28 minutes to be connected and was told I would be collected within 90minutes. I placed the call at 8:30 a.m. and after 2 hours I called again to see how much longer I would have to wait, this call took a little over 18 minutes. The guy eventually arrived just before mid day, (he showed me his report on screen and he hadn't been given the job till 35 minutes before collecting me!) he hooked up the car and took us to Mini Cooper Inchcape, where I would be able to collect a courtesy car and finally get to work. However, the courtesy car isn't with Mini Cooper but instead outsourced to Enterprise. So I had to wait for them to arrive but instead of bringing a car, I had to go with him to their office and wait for a car. I had to admit defeat and lose a days holiday, finally getting a car after 2p.m.
Why don't Mini have a spare tyre? I could've been on the road again within 20 minutes and why does a main dealer not hold stock of tyres to fix there and then?"
4/6/18,2,I had my car booked in as it had been recalled ! I had rearranged all my plans to make the appointment ! I left my car with the dealership and took a walk to find out when I had got back that they didn't have the parts to fix my car ! Wish that someone had called me in the morning or the evening before to make me aware of this as I had wasted an afternoon and had to sort child care ect ! Really not happy !
4/6/18,5,"Took my GLC350d into Mercedes Loughborough for a check on an error, I was given an A180d as a courtesy car, all communication was clear and appropriately pitched at my none tech mind, Service were thorough, and they presented me back with the fault cured and my vehicle also cleaned inside and out, everything went like clockwork with zero hastles. Pleasant staff on reception and in Service. Would recommend Mercedes Loughborough to anyone."
4/6/18,5,"Great experience, knowlegable staff, pleasure to deal with. Thank you!
I will be coming back."
4/6/18,5,"Quality all round. Good service, easonable price and excellent staff."
4/6/18,2,"I took the car in and asked for the following to be sorted,


Parking sensors can go off randomly
Squeaky brakes
Sat nav needs update
Black spot on the exhausts

I was advised

They found no fault with the sensors but yet I drove out of the garage and they started to go off.

Squeaky brakes, they couldn’t replicate it and said it was probably water on the disks. The car is garaged and the brake squeak when I reverse out of the garage. I have 3 other cars which do not have squeaky brakes.

The car is a lease car and they sat nav was not up to date and doesn't include the dual carriage way linking the M56 and the M6, that road was built and open before the car was registered. I was told you could not resolve this.

I asked for advise on how to keep the chrome exhausts clean and not sooted, I was told you didn’t know how to do this.

I was told the wheels would be taken off the car during the service. When I asked about swapping the fronts with the backs I was told that they weren’t coming off after all and this would be an extra £30, which I very reluctantly agreed to.

Finally the book was not stamped despite me requesting this at drop off and asking when I picked it up.

All in all you didn’t replace any matters and charged me extra for something which you had led me to believe was included.

The good things where the drop off and picked up service and the car was given a bit of a clean.

I won’t be recommending you nor will I be back.

Thanks
Peter"
4/6/18,5,"A very pleasant experience throughout with a good waiting area and refreshments for what was a fairly quick first service. Received an email video whilst waiting to confirm progress and well looked after by Mark and Neville throughout.
Car nicely cleaned upon return, thank you all."
4/6/18,5,"I booked my BMW in on a day when it was raining cats and dogs!
From the moment I walked in I was made welcome by Anne on reception.
She got me seated and provided a welcoming cup of coffee.
I was then taken to Lauren who did the paperwork for my substitute car and then took me to the car with a large umbrella.
On returning later in the day, the weather was still atrocious and the exemplary service was repeated with an escort by Lauren to my awaiting vehicle.
I have to say I was made to feel like royalty and would recommend this BMW dealership to anybody, Top Marks Coopers of Durham!!"
4/6/18,1,"Sadly they could not deliver the service they offered.

I booked my car in for a service. They promised me it would only take 1 hour. I delivered the car to them on time but they did not fulfil their promise of the 1 hour service. It took them 1 hour 40mins, it would have been longer if I hadn't stopped them from valeting it. There was no problem with my car, they blamed the customer service desk offering a service they couldn't deliver. Why do you do this?"
4/6/18,5,"Booked in for a (free) pre-end of warranty check. Decided to wait. Delicious complementary coffee whilst waiting and the loos are better than most people's home loos !! Friendly, professional staff. Oh, and there was an emailed video from the maintenance team explaining exactly what they'd done and what the tested results were for tyres/brakes etc when they had finished. Car was ready ten minutes before stated time & when I went back to the car it had been washed & polished and looked like it had come straight out of the showroom and none of it cost me a penny. Delighted with Coopers' service. Thanks guys."
4/6/18,5,Prompt proper professional...expensive
4/6/18,5,Courteous helpful and good to deal with.
4/6/18,2,Service from Adam was fine but the car came back very poorly cleaned yet to see how many scratches I will have to polish out!! And they did some work on the convertible roof I was driving along thinking what is that noise when I realised they hadn’t bothered to latch the roof completely on!!! What would of happened if I hadn’t realised?? ...I’ve been coming here for 10 years I will now be going to kings lynn as we always complain about your valeters to be no difference made and after buying 6 minis off you over the years I will now take my business to Adam rednall in Ipswich where I know my car will be taken car of so disappointed!!
4/6/18,5,"My car was subject of a safety recall over the driver's airbag. From reception by Demi through the Health Check and overall handling Chester Mercedes were excellent.
They even washed and vacuumed out my vehicle."
4/6/18,5,Very good service. I've been a client for several years now and the level of service was always excellent.
4/6/18,5,"Annual service Polo

My car was serviced yesterday......and, as always, it was managed excellently by Inchcape in Bolton.
Indeed, this time someone picked up and delivered my car back to me after the work. This was especially helpful as getting to and from the garage for me (recently retired) would have been awkward. It was so convenient.
The car did not need anything doing to it......even better. Kerry kept me informed through the day how things were going.
Perfect service."
4/6/18,5,"Hey my bmw is 17yrs old 36000 miles and still going strong, and I get a recall from bmw on this ancient motor so to coopers I go, was made welcome given coffee which was very good, and had the recall work done and car washed as a bonus. Hell bmw can keep recalling bits on it as it never gets washed, so thanks for that, its our 4th bmw and the last one lasted 27 years before we got rid good motor terrible in snow and ice but cant fault coopers bmw thanks a lot good service oh I got recall letter back in Aug 17 from bmw and never acted upon it so coopers phoned to make an appointment that was impressive in March 18 so ta have a good weekend Ann xx"
4/6/18,5,"Excellent service from Audi Stockport from

4/6/18,5,"Thanks to the team at Inchcape Twickenham for their excellent customer service, especially Vicky who was really helpful and kept me informed.
All the team are polite, helpful and friendly. And they kept my car overnight as I wasn't able to pick it up - and cleaned it too! Thank you very much."
4/6/18,5,"As usual, for me an excellent and friendly service. The vehicle was returned to me promptly, cleaned and (1 day after the service) what appears to be a quality technical activity.

Only confusion was the Online booking system which assumes a specific service pack based on mileage which is not appropriate for the on-board service monitoring."
4/6/18,1,"I brought my sq7 in for warranty work as a warning light had come on regarding the oil level and I’d had to call assistance out. I also called after dropping the car off to Stockport, to ask for the steering to be checked after it seemed to jolt when manovering at full lock. Needless to say the message wasn’t passed on until I phoned back. When I collected the car everyone was to busy leaving for the evening (5.55pm) with just the receptionist handing me my key with a sheet. No feedback to confirm the issues where solved, why they occurred and reassurance they won’t happen again. Not what I’d expect having bought the car from new from Stockport Audi 12 months earlier."
4/6/18,5,"Efficient, professional yet friendly service provided on the day. MOT and service completed on time. Communication through it all was excellent."
4/6/18,5,"Excellent service, friendly and helpful staff, Would recommend them."
4/6/18,3,"I've given it 3 stars because the Audi auto-on enablement (helps with hill starts) does not work at all. The light works on the button, but the hill start assists never lights up on the dash board (its a green lights). So, it's back to the garage.

UPDATE: It was my fault as I have not looked down at the auto enablement switch. My mistake, but luckily we called the garage in time to cancel the call. Thank you."
4/6/18,5,"Very Happy
I was very happy with the service I received from Inchcape Toyota Derby when my car went in for its MOT. Despite it needing various additional work, they were able to keep the cost to a very acceptable level.

4/6/18,1,"Bought car at BMW Teesside £30kplus two years ago. Finance and documentation advice was very poor and created problems with DVLA and insurance. Persuaded to pay £500 plus for tyre and alloy which until now have not used. First time damaged tyre contact with BMW service yesterday was a nightmare. When they do answer phone and before they take details they tell you they are short of staff , they promise to call back and don’t. They put you through to a central contact in Norwich who can’t contact them locally on the phone either and promise to email them. for goodness sake it’s just a tyre and I paid a lot of money for a rubbish service all round."
4/6/18,5,Great service!
4/6/18,5,From driving into the car park to driving out with a new car Cooper Tonbridge (Inchcape) provided a professional service that is a market leader.

4/5/18,5,"I have used Hunters Bilsborrow, now Inchcape since I bought my 1st Freelander in 1999. Since then I have changed my car every 3years with my last purchase of a Discovery Sport. Whether my visit to purchase or for service,I have received exceptional service. Any query has been answered efficiently, the mechanics, that I have often observed, appear to be work diligently and to a high spec. Inchcape who have take over Hunters, are in the throes of moving to a splendid ,customer very friendly new premises, I trust that the good work ethic and exceptional customer interface will extend to the new premises."
4/5/18,5,Excellent Service
4/5/18,3,"I took my Mercedes in to Inchcape, Loughborough for a safety recall.
I have to be frank and say that whilst the work was carried out promptly, no free overall safety check of the vehicle was carried out as I had been told that it would be by the service booking agent that I originally spoke to on the phone when booking the car in. Furthermore (and admittedly perhaps a bit picky) the car wasn't washed on its return to me (something that I have been accustomed to expecting whenever my car goes in to Inchcape for whatever reason)."
4/5/18,5,very good service
4/5/18,5,very efficient and friendly service.
4/5/18,5,"Fantastic service at VW Bury Lancashire on 4/4/18. Car was in for service on what was an extremely busy day. Karen Sergeant *service advisor* arranged for my car to be turned around in 2hours, due to having my 5 month old baby waiting with me. I did not request any special treatment, but Karen took it upon herself to arrange this which was extremely thoughtful and a god send! I have been a customer of VW at bury for a few years now and have always found them very personable and professional."

4/5/18,2,"Purpose of visit: Mercedes-Benz safety recall

Efficiently carried out and staff very pleasant.

Whilst on site car was given ""health check"" resulting in advice rear brake line is corroded and needs urgent attention. A quote for approaching £900 (nine hundred pounds) work was in my in-box on return to the office together with a very cursory video which did not highlight the alleged problem.

The car's usual service team have since checked the car and within minutes established this 80,000 mile car does not have a corroded brake line.

5 years ago when I bought my first Mercedes Inchcape sold me an under-powered C180. The car was okay but the purchase experience was not: at hand-over all the sales manager wanted to do was sell me several PPI type policies and was not at all pleased by refusal.

This visit confirmed my previous low opinion of Inchcape."

4/5/18,4,"I had the first service carried out and in general everything was good. However, I felt the delay in being seen both on dropping off and collecting the car was too long with room for improvement."
4/5/18,4,"Nice people and all work done as advised. Included a ""free"" car wash, great but the wheels need another go at them, alloys can be very difficult to keep clean. The work a bit longer than expected, the cynic would say this was due to lunch breaks. Lovely comfortable waiting area with complimentary coffee etc."
4/5/18,5,Always customer focused - Inchcape make the customer feel very welcome and appreciated. Polite and efficient - wish other areas of the service industry were as focused
4/5/18,5,Excellent customer services from when I called to arrange our vehicles service to collection. Mark was a pleasure to deal with.
4/5/18,5,"Reliable and efficient service. Damaged door mirror repaired within one week, even though a replacement part had to be ordered in. Honest assessment of damage and the actual repair came in substantially cheaper than quoted. I am more than happy to recommend this dealership for sales,service or repair."
4/5/18,2,They left the indoor lighting on and I only noticed it 2 days later when I wanted to use my car and the battery was flat...very annoying surprise in the morning! When I contacted them they said it might be an issue with the battery....but the Health Check they made 2 days before didn't show any problem......they didn't take any responsibility or offer any help.
4/5/18,5,"Have visited twice in the last few days and all members of staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. First visit was to look at motorcycle that we had seen on their website and we could not fault Steve who dealt with us, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. We returned today to complete the sale and once again Steve made the whole process so easy. A pleasure to do business with and would definitely recommend"

4/5/18,5,"Really grateful to Richard and Stephen Parfoot-Gray for their patience dealing with a car illiterate person. These two people were not pushy at all, explaining everything clearly and arranging paperwork in a straightforward manner. In fact they made buying a Range Rover quite a pleasurable experience. I am very pleased with my choice of car and my choice of Inchcape Southampton as dealers. I would not hesitate to recommend Inchcape and Richard and Stephen. PS. They also do lovely coffee🤗"
4/5/18,5,"Very efficient, courteous and value for money"
4/4/18,5,"Took my VW UP for minor service yesterday, I arranged to wait whilst the service was completed which was very swift. The technician (Gareth) who worked on my car sent me a video to show me the tyre tread depths and the underside of my car which I found really useful.Lindsey looked after me in the showroom making me a coffee and going through my paperwork and taking my payment when the service was completed, my car was parked right outside the front door and had been cleaned, I have always received 1st class customer service at VW Bury during the 6 years that I have been going there."
4/4/18,5,Great customer service by Gary and the team who were very attentive and knowledgeable
4/4/18,4,"For 5 stars, would have liked car returned at the agreed time (1hr 15min late -6.15pm returned) and not had to call 15 minutes before agreed return time to see if service had been completed."
4/4/18,5,Excellent service
4/4/18,5,"Always a great welcome and make sure that everything is discussed before making changes, or repairs. They don't do anything just because they can, only when they need to. Car always nice and clean on return."
4/4/18,1,"Took my car for service last year to Cooper BMW Cobham and changed break pads, when driving away the warning sign came up indicating that I need to replace break pads, I took it again to them and they couldn't fix it.

Then I took it to Cooper BMW in Thames Ditton and they told me its fixed, again the warning sign came up and so I had to make a complain and take it back, then they assured me that this will be fixed.

Now I took it again today for service and they charged me £850 for service and said they have to change also the break pad sensor, then the break pad warning light turned on again and have to take it back.

I wish I had taken it to a local garage and saved at least £500 on my costs and didn't have to deal with them."
4/4/18,2,"Waited 20 mins, then asked to be served to book in for service. early app due to commitments.
Phone call, ready at 5.00pm just being cleaned. picked up, not cleaned, camera disconnected.
No need for eye candy please, just service and a job well done."
4/4/18,5,"Good as usual. It was all done with the minimal of fuss. And it was done as I wanted; because we have other calls on our time.

The report following the video was good and showed up two problems, one of which needed fixing imedietly. The other can wait until May.

The video was not esey for me to follow."
4/4/18,5,Took my Audi A4 for its first service. This was the first time I have used Inchcape Stockport Audi. Absolutely no issues dealership staff were very friendly. Will definitely be going back.
4/4/18,5,"Friendly staff, no surprises, recommended!"
4/4/18,5,"My allocated salesman, Oliver Potts, was helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly from the outset, and over the 4 months it took to get me the exact version of a new model, a BMW X3. He is a credit to the business and I am sure he will be very successful in his chosen career.

The whole experience was a pleasure."
4/4/18,5,"Had to take my car in for warranty work (never bought anything from this dealer beforehand) and was treated like a returning customer. Very knowledgeable service advisor talked me through the warranty work and took the time to answer a few non related queries. Work appears to be done to a high standard. Was given a lift home whilst I was waiting for the car to be completed.
Will be taking the car to the dealership to be serviced in the future."
4/4/18,5,"The guys are always friendly and efficient and open.

One improvement - Sometimes in the morning it’d be good to be able to drop the keys and run without having to hang around and sign paperwork.

Maybe the paperwork could be done over email instead?"
4/4/18,3,Courtesy car ready on arrival.Service on car okay...but just a couple of small issues not happy with..
4/4/18,5,"The truth is, I entered the showroom at Coopers BMW in Chelmsford without the intention of buying a car. I was just browsing and killing time really. In wandering around the showroom, I spotted a car I really liked. I then met up with the sales executive Andrew Unwin and got talking to him about the particular car. With no pressure from him whatsoever, he offered to arrange a test drive and offered to run the numbers on the finance. With nothing to lose, I agreed, and after a bit of negotiation, he put together a package for me that worked for both me and him and I took ownership of the new car with no fuss, no pressure, no silly sales-tactics, just a proper grown up business transaction. The after-delivery call from Andrew to check everything was o.k. was very much appreciated. I thoroughly recommend the dealership and Andrew in particular. First class service."
4/4/18,5,"Cannot fault the service I received when I took my A3 in for its first routine service this week. The whole team from reception to service desk were courteous and efficient, and the speed and quality of the car service itself was fantastic (especially liked the video from my service technician - very nice touch). All in all a fantastic service, and I will definitely use Inchcape Audi as my regular point of service from now on."
4/4/18,5,Very efficient in all respects
4/4/18,5,"Always friendly knowledgeable staff. Plenty of coffee available while waiting.
Very efficient and honest business."
4/4/18,5,Good customer services and also good people👍
4/4/18,2,"Unfortunately my car was not returned to me until nearly 7pm. I was at work and was unable to leave (normally go home between 5-6) which I find unacceptable. My car was picked up in the morning and I had the video sent at lunchtime, so very disappointing it took so long to be delivered back to me after a service. I was told it was due to lack of drivers, which I don't understand as the car was booked in a couple of weeks beforehand, so why was this not managed properly. If you don't have adequate staff to complete the tasks then they should be rescheduled or customers told about the potential delays."
4/4/18,5,It was an excellent experience
4/4/18,5,"Good communication, Trouble Free"
4/4/18,5,"Denise was an absolute star. Very friendly, very professional and made my experience 5*

Thank you Denise for a great customer experience"
4/4/18,5,best quality standards
4/4/18,5,Excellent service as always
4/4/18,5,"It is always a pleasure going into inchape, staff are always helpful, polite and professional"
4/4/18,5,We purchased an Audi from Sam at Maidstone. The service we received was 1st Class.
4/4/18,5,"As always, amazing service and feedback."
4/3/18,5,"Good service, good communication, and did small adjustment at no extra charge. Very satisfied."
4/3/18,4,"Generally it was a very good experience, until the final few days - i feel that the financial breakdown could have been explained more clearly which did cause some confusion.

All cleared up eventually but it did leave me disappointed with the overall service"
4/3/18,2,"My BMW approved vehicle was handed over in a poorly prepared condition including a dirty interior, damage to the paintwork and alloy wheel. On a positive note, the dealership will rectify the issues but the vehicle should never have passed through the quality process to reach a customer who had travelled over 80 miles to collect it..

The whole experience, from start to finish, was not, I believe, conducive to spending the significant amount of money on a prestige brand."
4/3/18,1,"Went in for a leaking roof on a 2016 reg e class cabriolet, came back with dirty oil stains on roof, had to re-book in to get cleaned, was told on the phone that the roof would be getting a full clean only for the car to be sent back to me with some stains still on the roof (cloth) and patchy cleaning marks clearly visible on the fabric convertible roof. When questioned I was told that these marks are possibly wear and tear and that the whole roof was not cleaned but only a small section of the roof was cleaned near the edges. No real help, when i called up i was given attitude and no real help."
4/3/18,5,"I would like to thank John and Claire at East Kent Audi for looking after me and for finding my new car. After being let down by another dealer, John tracked down a new car to my specification and colour choice.

A minor hiccough with the changed content of the Sound & Comfort pack by Audi between 2017 and 2018, didn't cause them a problem, they simply sorted out the 'missing' rear view camera by arranging one to be retro fitted.

customer service is not all about avoiding problems, it's more about how they are resolved when they happen and I couldn't ask for a better response from Claire. Thanks for proactively arranging to retrofit an Audi reversing camera through my local Audi dealer ..... I will await the appointment details over the next week and then it's problem solved.

I was beginning to think I would be starting my search all over again, but their solution to pay for a retrofit camera at my local Audi dealer nearer to me was perfect and just what I wanted to hear.

Thanks for your service and care - despite the fact that you are 260 miles away I will always come back to you at Canterbury for a new Audi. I had struggled to find someone I could trust, until I spoke to John and Claire at Canterbury ...... their attention to my needs and the response to the reversing camera issue showed their integrity and honesty and commitment to excellent customer service."
4/3/18,1,"I picked up my new Audi on Good Friday, as you can imagine extremely excited. I was told as it was a bank holiday there would be limited people to do the handover and show me all the extras I had purchased which was fair enough so I booked to go the following Tuesday. Firstly they were not expecting me and when someone came to see me their knowledge was very limited. They got someone else to help me as I had a particular problem making sky go work on the tablets that were in the back in the car (main reason I purchased the tablets was to download stuff for the kids, given they were costing me £1k I repeatedly asked if Sky go would work on them and was repeatedly told yes) the person couldn’t get it to work and didn’t know why so I have paid £1k for 2 monitors to sit in the back of the car with two children looking at blank screens. This coupled with the other questions I had only to be told by the person who was helping me that he’d only been there 4 months and didn’t know much - how long does it take to do understand the range of cars you are selling?! I like the car but it has left a bad taste in the mouth with Audi and Inchcape! As I reflect on the whole purchase experience where I had other problems I must say Inchcape don’t seem to understand customer service."
4/3/18,1,"I purchased a car back in 2007, whereby I part exchanged my old car and gave £500.00 deposit. It is only now, when I am going through paperwork, that I find that the deposit given was kept by INCHCAPE RETAIL and not used to reduce my finance!"
4/3/18,5,"Having been unable to get any response from Inchcape Macclesfield (avoid), ended up buying a used Golf from Inchcape Manchester, particular thanks goes to Mark Bott.

Nice touch of having the car within the showroom (with a car cover fitted), to allow new owner to unveil the polished car ready for driving away, I’ve never had that before even with brand new cars."
4/3/18,5,"Great range of approved used cars.
Excellent service across the showroom and I was dealt with a very knowledgable and helpful sales man, Max. The after sales package is excellent including a two year warranty and breakdown cover. The Jaguar XF I purchased is a great car and passed my expectations. Very pleased and I am very likely to used the company throughout the period I own the car and will consider another one from them in the future"
4/3/18,3,"Did not clean car as part of MOT.
Oil and dirt on doors and door handles.
Did not change oil."
4/3/18,5,I traded in my Hybrid for an upgrade and it was such an easy transaction! Signed the paperwork one day and collected the new car the very next day. Tom and Dan were lovely and very helpful and the instructional video Tom sent to me will be used lots and lots I am sure.
4/3/18,5,Very good level of customer service. You were an absolute pleasure to deal with. A+++
4/3/18,5,"After an experience to forget at another Cooper branch I’d like to thank yourselves for the excellent customer service I received when purchasing my new X5 last week. From the minute I arrived at your garage to the minute I left with my new car I was well looked after and that was all I was wanted after my previous experience with your company.
Thanks very much."
4/3/18,5,"We were well looked after by Jorge Eley who was most courteous, professional and extremely helpful when we purchase our car from your Derby showroom.
This is the third Jaguar we have purchased from the Derby site and have always been totally satisfied with our treatment and experience.
Peter & Margaret Wilshaw (Burton upon Trent)."
4/3/18,5,Resolved my issue and were quite helpful
4/3/18,4,"Good service, but advisory items rather conservative. Our car is two years old and still has the original front tyres with 5mm tread. So an advisory to replace, with a planned follow-up call in 3 months time is unreasonable. At the current wear rate, I estimate the tyre will still be legal in two years!"
4/3/18,5,"Can't fault the service! From arriving at the dealership, the staff were smiley, friendly and welcoming. My car was serviced and returned to me with a full explanation of the work undertaken and a detailed report for me to take home. The staff are great and, no matter who I have dealt with, they all have the same excellent customer care."
4/3/18,5,"Excellent informative and attentive service. Henry was great, not your typical car salesman. Not pushy at all. Out of the three car showrooms I visited, this was the one where I was happiest to do business. Very enjoyable experience."
4/3/18,5,"Salesman, Chris was very responsive and helpful and came across as very 'genuine'. Excellent service too"
4/3/18,5,"cant speak highly enough... great service,.... great staff. great car..."
4/3/18,5,Excellent service. Work carried out on time and to a good standard
4/3/18,5,Very professional. Competitive deal offered fulfilled my requirements. Straightforward no sales jargon. I will go back again.
4/3/18,5,A pleasant greeting on arrival from the reception as always. Made to feel welcome and always dealt with promptly by both the sales and service department. I expected high standards and I felt like I got them. I would recommend to my friends
4/3/18,5,"Excellent Service from the team & very helpful, they will try to help wherever possible to ensure you get the Mini of your dreams!"
4/3/18,5,"Thanks, a great experience"
4/2/18,5,Sales person who appeared to care about cars and the customer.
4/2/18,5,"I visited Coopers BMW in Colchester after seeing a ad online. I took a trip down and from the moment i wanted onto the forecourt and through the doors the service was impeccable. Ian who was the sales executive was a friendly and helpful individual. Allowed me to view the car and test drive. Not a pushy salesman, he gave me a detailed explanation of all options to go ahead with an offer. Within 2 weeks of viewing the car, i managed to sell my own car privately and walk away with a BMW 4 series. The package was customised to my needs, and Mathew also helped me understand the aftercare. The team in Coopers Colchester are fantastic. The service is next to none. Would recommend visiting the Colchester branch. I wil deffo be using this branch again, and recommending to my friends and family. Thanks alot guys i love the new car ☺"
4/2/18,5,"Excellent service from the moment we first arrived. Friendly welcome from reception, and introduced to Chris Mayes, to whom particular credit must be given. Very knowledgeable, friendly, and listened to my requirements and provided a solution with which I'm very happy.

Oh, and LOVE my new car!"
4/2/18,5,Excellent service
4/2/18,5,"Really great experience buying the car. Malo was very knowledgeable and friendly and put no pressure on us whatsoever.

Highly recommended."
4/2/18,5,Great Service
4/2/18,5,"From the minute we walked in to the garage, they were incredibly helpful and fantastic. If you're after a mini, I can't recommend them highly enough!"
4/2/18,3,bad experience this time round with Mercedes Benz oxford when I had my servicing done
4/2/18,5,"I received a first class customer service from start to finish with Malcolm and Carlos at Cooper BMW Thames Ditton when purchasing my new BMW M4 Competition Package. Spent time explaining everything in detail and after viewing the car and securing it, a complimentary video of the car was sent by email which was a nice touch. The hand over experience was great, again plenty of time spent explaining the controls. I've purchased many new cars over the years, many of which have been BMW's but this was my first experience with Cooper BMW and I was impressed, it was worth travelling the distance from Wales to find not only the perfect car but the level of service and attention deserved when buying a premium brand. Thumbs up Guys!!!!"
4/2/18,4,"Very smooth process, both James Yeomans and the sales manager were helpful."
4/2/18,5,Was looking for a new Mini Cooper S - missed out on one but the staff kept my details and let me know when a new one was available. Great car and the purchasing experience was smooth and stress free. Highly recommend Cooper Cobham!
4/2/18,5,"Treated like a Customer should be by Sales person Clare Pepper.

Clare did everything we asked and went the extra mile to help us make the decision to use Tonbridge Mini to buy our new Mini Cooper 5 door hatch.

I would trust Clare and will definately want to deal with her again."
4/2/18,5,First class service from start to finish by Marc. Would highly recommend Mercedez Benz Oxford to anyone.
4/2/18,5,"Friendly, helpful & knowledgeable staff. Very little waiting around, got through the formalities and payment very quickly. Extremely satisfied with the service provided to me by Mani Roper and colleagues."
4/2/18,5,"As previously found the service received was excellent, I would suggest there was no way they could improve their service."
4/2/18,5,"My first-time dealings with VW for first service at 10k I have had a very positive and happy experience as they quoted me a reasonable price for the service and at time I asked for
Staff were friendly and helpful
Only slight issue would be that more staff at service desk would have been ideal so people didn't have to wait to be seen"
4/2/18,5,An easy and efficient transaction with a friendly team.
4/2/18,5,"Staff were really welcoming, I was dealing with Richard he was great."
4/2/18,5,"Great service and really friendly staff, especially Niall. Thank you , love my new Mini"
4/2/18,3,"Chelmsford branch.We bought a brand new car and absolutely excited. Sales man we dealt with was really helpful to begin with. However a week later he was not returning my calls, or responding to emails. He was only bothered about sale no after care. Considering we only had three weeks until car was delivered. We had to make arrangements for the other car we currently owned. We were told car will be delivered not the case at all. When we had to sign paperwork
we found out that sales man no longer worked for the company. It would have been nice to be informed. Hence the poor communication no information passed on from him. Unfortunately another guy took over the case. He has been brilliant and a lifesaver. But he can only do so much.

Personally think poor Management and they do not care about customers. Such poor customer service. When we turned up to pick up car, number plate not on and was not given this information for ages. So I could enquire about insurance. Very disappointed no apologies from
Management. They think they are above everyone how rude.
They did not make it exciting to pick up the car. Fortunately In love with the car. But if there was the same car with same spec elsewhere. Would have gone there instead.
They talk about commitment of customer service. What a lot of nonsense, remove that sign because your not performing at all. Customer is always right and treat them
Like a King or Queen. Don’t know where some of staff did their training. I am horrified and very angry. Will not be buying there in the future and will not recommend my family or friends. What a shame."
4/2/18,5,Great service . Well looked after. Darren is always excellent Ii am the customer with him for long time .
4/2/18,5,"Super friendly salesman. No hardsell, and very knowledgable. Extremely helpful, could not do enough for us."
4/2/18,5,"Excellent service from Rhys ..not pushy .. very polite and aware of the situation I was in and consequently pulled out all the stops to get a new Mini Countryman on the road within a week .. much appreciated and will use coopers Colchester again ..
All the staff were attentive and knowledgable ..
I was treated with utmost respect from beginning to end .
Thank you Carol"
4/2/18,5,James is credit your business. From start off the sale too the very day we picked up the car he was amazing. We took our two boys with us on day we picked up the car and James was amazing with them. He is credit too your business.
4/2/18,5,Excellent - a pleasure to deal with
4/2/18,5,Very happy with service & they were quick & efficient
4/2/18,5,"Amazing service from both David and Sam. Couldn’t believe how quickly they sourced the perfect car for me and turned it around. All under 48 hours. They were an absolute pleasure to deal with. Thank you both again.

4/1/18,1,"Terrible and a nervous experience. I could not believe a so called reputable company Volkswagen could treat a customer like myself in such disregards.

My Golf Gt Mk7 2.0 tdi, had full VW history and WAS a well looked after vehicle. It went In for repairs at VW Stockport inchape, due to the vehicle blowing out cold air, this led the heater exchange (matrix) and water pump to be replaced under vw warranty.

After vw stripped the engine they tried to wriggle their way out of the warranty work. I had to argue with vw that my Golf remains under 'extended warranty' which it did but he tried everything in the book until they finally honoured the agreement. I had to hire a vehicle myself during the two weeks the car was in for repairs.

However, the day came for me to collect my vehicle that spent almost two weeks at vw for repairs. Within a few hours of collecting my golf it caught fire. The fire occurred whilst I was driving and had started in the engine bay. The whole car has been destroyed and Im really lucky to be alive today.

It has been an on going dispute with both Volkswagen UK and the VW Stockport inchape franchise since November. I have now been told by VW that the cause of the fire has nothing to do with them and I should deal with my insurance company. I now stand to lose all my no claims bonus and my £1000.00 excess!

I believe this is clearly workmanship negligence that has caused this fire. I have kept my golf in prestige condition no matter the cost, this will be the last time I will ever purchase a volkswagen or any VAG car.

And till this day I've not received a single apology which I think is outrageous."
4/1/18,5,"No hesitation in recommending amazing derive and attention to detail on every level very happy with service and love my new car

Thanks Nicola x"
4/1/18,5,"We are more than happy with the excellent hand over experience and sales advice we received from Chris Davies. He always made us very welcome and nothing was too much trouble.
We appreciated his good advice when choosing the specification for our new car. His expertise helped us make the right decisions, and we now have a car we are very satisfied with, which makes the driving experience of our BMW X2 all the more enjoyable.
We have ordered many cars from Chris in the past and have come to trust him implicitly ."
4/1/18,5,Vary good all round service.
4/1/18,5,Excellent service every time.
4/1/18,5,Awesome service
4/1/18,2,"This was the second all day booking under warranty to deal with an 'Auto Hold' fault, whereby the auto hold will engage satisfactorily but, intermittently will not release the car, leading to stalling in queues, traffic light queues and the like. You have so far failed to deal with the problem although staff have been polite throughout.
i paid good money, in a fair deal with your sales people ( esp Gavin Osborne) which included a twelve month warranty from which I gained great confidence in the car, and vendor; confidence that is now lost.
As of now I am extremely disappointed and will be writing to VW to seek improvements in the situation.
re VO64YGE"

4/1/18,1,"My sister Purchased a car from Stockport Audi only to have noticed they had put the wrong number plate on her car. She drove it straight out the showroom with a different Reg that wasn’t registered, taxed or even legal for that matter. Rang up the next day as the store was closed. the staff at Stockport were none the wiser what they had done. She had to change her plans for bank holiday Easter drive back to Stockport to change the plates only to find the plates were not ready there was a problem with the new plates that had been printed. The numbers for the plate didn’t print properly so it couldn’t be done until Tuesday due to everyone being off for the bank holiday weekend. They then tried to say they will give my sister a curtisy car in automatic when she only drive manual. Four different members of staff came out on several occasions trying to fob us off with an excuse which was pathetic. One gentleman said “here I found an airfreshner you can have it” as if a poxy airfreshner for a 31,000 car will make everything okay. What an insult. Awful experience for my sister when it was her first time buying her own first car. Will never return again once this issue Is fixed!!!"
4/1/18,5,"This was my first experience of buying a ‘new’ car. I’d done lots of showroom shopping but from the moment I walked through the door, I knew I’d made the right decision......no hard sales and great coffee! I was kept up to date from beginning to end. I would recommend Mini to anyone!"
4/1/18,3,Recently took delivery of discovery sport HSE every thing was good up to the delivery day as I was working away the car was to be delivered to my wife at our home address. We were assured that someone who new the car inside out would be In attendance and would spend as much time as needed with my wife to make sure she knew how everything worked unfortunately this was not the case. However we are very pleased with the car.
4/1/18,5,"Fantastic show room and service Marie was superb ,
knowledgeable and helpful.
The 48 hour test drive certainly made me purchase a
mini above other cars I tested ."

3/31/18,5,"Had a bad experience at Mercedes Liverpool and was a bit apprehensive to go to another dealer but Mercedes Cheshire oaks was amazing. Looked after me from when I walked in

3/31/18,5,"We called in at H A Fox Jaguar Preston showroom just to look at a the new E-PACE (which my wife and I fell in love with immediately.) From ordering through to picking up our new car a few days later the service and attention to detail was exceptional. A big thank you to our sales executive Ryan A who was extremely knowledgeable about the car and did a fantastic job for us. He understood our needs and proceeded at our PACE (sorry for the pun ) and there was no pressure.

We had a follow up phone call the day after picking the car up to check if we were happy and if we needed any help with the technology - which we did!!

To sum up I can't praise them enough. I would certainly recommend H A Fox /Inchcape."
3/31/18,5,"From the moment we entered the showroom for our initial enquiry we have been looked after and kept informed. We are very pleased we the service Wayne, Howard & George provided. And especially pleased with our new E-Pace."
3/31/18,5,Rhys and the rest of the team here were brilliant to deal with. We travelled from swansea on a saturday and the team were extremely busy with appointments booked but they managed to see us. Would highly recommend and found their prices on approved used very good. Would deffinitely consider the journey again when we purchase our next car.
3/31/18,5,this visit was a remarkable change to previous visits at the branch in Warrington. Pleasant respectful staff. Waiting tie acceptable . Dealt with professionally. I could not wait for free car health check due to a hospital appointment and will be rebooking for a later date. Recall handled satisfactorily. A significant change to previous visits. thank you.
3/31/18,5,Excellent service from first visit to final collection. Big thank you to Tony for his help.
3/31/18,3,"Having taken the car in at 9am was promised it would be ready by 5pm, saying they would call us when ready. Come 5 no contact from them , tried phoning but no body bothered to answer, not once but 3 times. Eventually we went in at 5.45 and found that the service had been done, but no apologies for not letting us know.
Having had the car all day it was bad management that it had to be the last car of the day to be done.
Pretty poor show."

3/30/18,4,Good services at BMW York.
3/30/18,5,Bought a used X4 Bmw from Cooper Durham and I had one of the easiest and most straightforward buying experiences I’ve ever had. Many thanks to Tom my salesman for a clear and easy way to buy a quality used car.
3/30/18,5,Very good service - clear explanation of what had been carried out . Offered me one of their office pods - with a power socket to work in while waiting.
3/30/18,5,"Excellent service, kept fully informed of progress. Job was estimates to be completed in 3 hours, actually completed in 2 hours 45 minutes. Staff were very attentive and were regularly asking if there was anything they could do to make my wait more acceptable."
3/30/18,5,Danny Rhodes was extremely professional and helpful. Nothing was a problem. Extremely please with service and of course my new car. GJ
3/30/18,3,"Not the easiest experience trying to book a service. Central booking hung up as soon as I got through ( this happened 3 times).
On day of service could not return the service guy's call as he wouldn't answer phone. No one was answering the phone at the service desk.i asked to be called between certain times but no one called back. In the end I called and left a message and requested my car be brought home."
3/30/18,4,The only thing that detracted from a great experience was the length of time it took to book the car in 1st thing. There were 4 people wanting to drop off their cars so it was quite a lengthy wait as only 1 service consultant was dealing with us all.
3/30/18,5,"Excellent service, Very pleased with my Mini great part exchange price, Very professional sales. would recommend Inchcape.

3/30/18,4,Car collected serviced and MOT'd and returned to me. Only downside was that the car was cleaned outside and hoovered in the front but not back or boot. I understand they had a staff shortage problem but it hasn't caused me a problem. Just grateful they could collect and return.
3/30/18,4,"Excellent and attentive staff in service reception. Very good complimentary valet service and I like knowing exactly what everything is going to cost. My only gripe is with the ""health check"". I had this done at the same time as an MOT and frankly it told me nothing except that my car was in great condition, no information that I couldn't get from the MOT pass. The health check costs over £70 and is frankly a waste of money which I will not be having again.

Nice coffee by the way!"
3/30/18,5,Freiendly and efficient staff. Service time was changed to help me out during the day.
3/30/18,5,Very helpful staff. Service carried out efficiently and quickly.
3/30/18,5,"If you need a new or used car - call Michael Taylor at Maidstone Audi. Professional, honest and friendly advice."
3/30/18,5,Great service.
3/30/18,5,"Excellent sales experiance, promp response to obtaining car specification,
cost quote details and availability, through initial enquiry stage and during the negotiation process.
Sales staff went that extra mile to obtain my vehicle of choice within the budget parameters set. No high pressure selling techniques employed to add extra's over and above those I had specified myself.
I would certainly recommend giving Coopers the opportunity to quote for your next new or used vehicle."
3/30/18,4,"Outstanding service from start to finish from Craig who was knowledgeable, informative and a credit to Inchcape from start to finish.

My reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the rudeness from another member of the team when Craig was not available and also that on the first two occasions I visited the showroom, I was not helped or approached by anyone - it was only when I met Craig that I was looked after and treated respectfully.

The overall deal and quality of car was excellent, thanks guys"
3/30/18,4,"Could do with having a customer Wifi, i needed to get some work done whilst i waited for my car to be checked and struggled on my mobile."
3/30/18,5,Pleasant helpful and efficient service
3/30/18,5,Professional service. Friendly staff
3/30/18,5,"Very helpful staff, regularly keeping in touch to update me on the status of my new car."
3/30/18,4,I find Jade very helpful and not defensive in anyway when there have been issues.
3/30/18,5,"They did what they quoted at the price they quoted, in the time they quoted. Staff were great."
3/30/18,5,Super service never ever had a problem with the Warrington showroom
3/30/18,5,"Service went according to plan
I chose to wait in the waiting area
Coffee ok but BMW could have some savoury items to try."
3/30/18,5,"Great service and facilities. Staff very helpful, friendly."
3/30/18,5,From start to finish Will Jenkins and Steve Champion were superb. Any queries or requests were always responded to very promptly. By far the most professional BMW dealer in the area after I’d visited several looking for a new vehicle.
3/30/18,5,"My word what an incredibly pleasant experience that was - I have purchased many cars over the years new and old and this by far was streets ahead in how customers should be treated. Alex Clubely in the New Cars Sales Department at the Liverpool branch couldn't help anymore if he tried, nothing too little or too much. Any slight hiccup was dealt with exceptionally quickly and didn't leave you hanging waiting on answers. He worked exceptionally hard to get us what we wanted - and we were asking a lot - even very last minute changes of heart and specification requirements where dealt with in a very professional manner but most important of all a smile. Made my wife & I feel very special which he didn't disappoint - exactly how a major purchase should be. The branch is a credit to Mercedes and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.

You've made our year thank you."
3/30/18,4,Great service friendly staff and quickly dealt with.
3/30/18,5,"Excellent service, would recommend to anyone!"
3/30/18,5,Brilliant customer service! Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
3/30/18,5,Every time I’ve visited this branch of BMW COOPER they have been professional and bend over backwards to help you very impressed would recommend this branch and there staff to anyone
3/30/18,5,"Polite and friendly staff, excellent service . Would definitely recommend! Thank you!!"
3/30/18,5,"Great help, support customer care from start to finish, Mr Oliver Potts our sales person was exceptional in finding us the right car and deal to suit our needs, I couldn't recommend him & BMW teesside enough,

Thanks again to all !

Regards

Mr & Mrs Scott."
3/30/18,4,"First class service at TW Audi. Very professional front of house staff. Very courteous. Comfortable lounge. Only blip was not resetting the next service reminder in the cars computer so after having the service, on turning off ignition I was reminded it needed a service now! However, a quick call to Steve got that sorted, he arranged for an engineer to drive out to my home and this got fixed the following day. No quibble. Thanks."
3/30/18,3,"Servicing of my car. Pick up and drop off of the car went smoothly.
Done on time.
However, not all that I was promised was done. For example, the complimentary car wash/valletting I was promised when I booked the service was not done. My car was not even cleaned at all.
Also getting through on the telephone to the service department was extremely frustrating. Phone was just ringing out."
3/30/18,4,honest friendly staff who were very helpful
3/30/18,5,"Helpful, friendly staff"
3/30/18,5,"I found the sales lady Janet Collins extremely helpful when first considering buying an A1 and during the order process and when eventually taking delivery of my car last Friday.

I am very pleased with the A1."
3/29/18,5,Every one was very helpful and the car felt much better for the service and was cleaned beautifully. The young lsdy who took the payment was very helpfuk and explained every thing to me.
3/29/18,5,Very good service from Tetbury Audi
3/29/18,5,"New car purchase. Very helpful advice, service and communication throughout the process. Car collection seamless with as much or as little information as you required. Overall would recommend dealership. Thanks for everything Tom."
3/29/18,5,Thanks to Craig in Warrington for helping me make the correct choice with my new car. This is the 2nd time purchasing a car from Mercedes Warrington. Excellent customer service and will defiantly recommend to other people.
3/29/18,5,"Inchcape Mercedes Oxford - Have dealt with the branch for 6 years with 5 cars, mixed service and last review was a poor one, VERY PLEASED to report this dealer has exceeded my expectations on todays visit. Booked my S class in for service while you wait, service reception came back after a while with the ""we have noted the following and would advise"" car needed some brakes and turbo seal, cost of replacing the seal was £120, with seal costing £19, as I had replaced one myself on another car advised I would just buy the seal and DIY. Very polite reception came back 10 minutes later to advise they could fit it for just the cost of the part saving me £100, I nearly fell off my seat! It got even better, car has parking sensor and keyless entry which was playing up, now fixed, not charged anything, could have been a software issue - Oxford you have redeemed yourself and excellent service has been returned, many thanks."
3/29/18,2,"The timescale from ordering my new car to collection date, i felt, was a quick turnaround; the car is exactly what i wanted and exceeds expectations. I would highly recommend the 0% finance option the Basingstoke dealership offered and the peace of mind this offer gave me when placing the order. The information provided by staff was thorough, all my questions were answered and i felt confident that I was making the right choice in purchasing a Toyota vehicle.
However, the communication received from the salesman in the week before the collection day broke my trust with the service of the dealership. I lost all confidence that I would be able to actually collect the car on the agreed date. The day of collection I arrived on time with a feeling that something would go wrong, unfortunately, I was right. I was immediately told the salesman who was meant to be doing my handover was off and there was roughly a two hour delay with the vehicle (as there were preparations that needing completing before it could be handed over). I left the dealership and returned 2 hours later, as advised, only to find further delays on my return. In total from the agreed collection time, I was waiting almost 4 and a half hours from arriving to actually driving the car away.
The member of staff who stepped up to cover for the salesman was brilliant. He went out of his way to chase up the progress of the car and was very apologetic. I feel he was left to pick up the pieces, which wasn't a fair position to put him in.
I had in depth conversations whilst there with two of the managers in the dealership. I feel the issues I was unfortunate enough to encounter were taken on board and will be fed back accordingly, it was just unfortunate that the good customer service had to come so late in the process.
Overall I would say with the right member of staff, this dealership would be a great place to purchase a car from and the vehicles are of a very high standard.
I will also add, as a woman, the chauvinistic car dealership mentality needs to change. The contract for my car and paperwork showed MR on the initial draft and my husband was addressed more than I was, often first, despite the fact he wasn't the customer, the car isn't his, nor was he paying for any of it. When arranging a date and time for a test drive, and discussing one of the reasons I wanted this new car was for a bigger boot, I was then asked ""is that for you shopping and shoes?"" One of the first questions I was then asked when placing the order for the car was ""what colour would you like?"" before I was able to even go over the model I wanted or ask any questions about the vehicle. I feel this attitude towards women buying cars needs to change. A paying customer is a customer, regardless of gender."
3/29/18,2,no brakes in stock
3/29/18,5,"The Parts Engineer to whom I spoke was knowledgeable, and able to quickly determine what parts I needed and to expeditiously supply them."
3/29/18,5,"Incape were very good with my recent service and MOT. They offered me a service on a day where I would get cheaper servicing and also they repaired a sensor under warranty.
Great Service and a curtesy car. Thanks for the great service."
3/29/18,3,disappointed
3/29/18,5,"Very efficient from the booking to the conduct of the combined service and MOT. Courteous and efficient staff throughout the operation. I also appreciated the video of the safety inspection.
My only criticism would be the bill, but it was a major service!"
3/29/18,5,"Apart from the eye-watering cost of the full service, I am completely satisfied with the work done. Being taken back into Norwich and returned to the service centre by courtesy car also worked well."
3/29/18,5,Excellent service
3/29/18,5,Heated seats not working fault found quickly awaiting new parts.
3/29/18,5,"I have always dealt with coopers, and I have found that I am always treated with courtesy. I would have no hesitation in recommending Cooers/.
Thank you.

3/29/18,5,Great service and very helpful.
3/29/18,1,"My recent service and MOT.
Put my VW Golf into Inchcape Volkswagen at Cheltenham this week. The receptionist was offhand and completely unhelpful when I was trying to determine when my car might be ready. The car failed the MOT on a tyre and two windscreen wipers. Both items were not in stock and they were unable to tell me when they would be available for fitting, if at all. I was told to go and buy my wipers at Halfords! In the post service review the receptionist was rude about the fact that a couple of minor faults (not related to the MOT) had been pointed out to me previously and I hasn't acted on their advice.

Won't be going back to them again! I used them assuming I would get good service and they would have the correct parts if anything needed replacing.. Might as well go to a good general service garage and get a better service at a cheaper rate (and a polite reception)! Thanks for nothing, Inchcape."
3/29/18,5,Very helpful staff. Kept me updated with the time to complete job. Also informed me of a recall which I knew nothing about. Highly recommend for excellent service and quality of care
3/29/18,5,"pleasant staff, well looked after, and kept informed"
3/29/18,5,Polite efficient honest
3/29/18,4,Well looked after. Looking forward to my next visit
3/29/18,5,"I would absolutely recommend Maidstone Audi and I have received excellent customer service from Michael Crotty in particular and Ian (apologies I don't know his surname) your technical specialist who took me on my initial test drive. I can only compare my experience to Mercedes and I can definitely say that you have surpassed them in every aspect of customer service.

On a negative note, my initial call into Maidstone Audi was very different to the experience I had once I visited in person. I spoke to Julian ahead of an Audi owners event you had scheduled recently; he told me several times that the weekend was really only for Audi owners that were looking to buy; that I probably would not be able to secure a test drive and 3 times he told me that the only real focus that weekend would be securing sales as he and the sales team had quarterly targets to achieve give it was March. I told him several times that I was buying and not just browsing but he kept telling me the weekend was really only for Audi owners. I could quite easily from his attitude have never made it to your branch at all."
3/29/18,5,"Excellent service, fair price and very friendly, helpful staff"
3/29/18,5,"Excellent Service, Video emailed and text to me showing the damage underneth my car so that i could make a quick desicion to authorise the work."
3/29/18,5,"Had a very good experience with Levi while looking for our next car and he managed to find what we were looking for.
Always find buying a car a bit drawn out,sometimes wish it was simpler but I suppose we all want a bargain and that's the only way."
3/29/18,5,Very helpful service advisor's and car was ready when they said it would
3/29/18,4,"Very pleased with all aspects of the service delivery at Smith Knight Fay Oldham: the staff are first rate and very professional.
I have only one gripe and that is the poor standard of the wash and vacuuming of my vehicle and for this part of the service I can only award a score of 2 out of 10 marks for the following reasons:-
1. None of the alloy wheels were cleaned and they were just left with the deposits of dust and grime from the brake pads and road use etc.
2. No attempt was made to clean the bodywork from knee height downwards. Quite disappointing the car just needed a simple wash.
Regards

Neville Siddall"
3/29/18,5,Very good communication and friendly professional staff
3/29/18,5,Extremely good and helpful service from the sales person Caroline Flanagham. Extremely good experience overall.
3/29/18,5,"Excellent throughout my purchase process,
Straight talk, informative product knowledge, non-pressurised.
Matt my sales person was first rate at his job with a professional yet relaxed manner. Highly recommend Inchcape Land Rover."
3/29/18,5,Small issue at the start was well dealt with and swiftly resolved.
3/29/18,5,Both Harley and Andy were most polite and helpful. Andy particularly was very patient making sure I understood what was said before continuing. When Harley took me to my vehicle and had to explain things a couple of times he never made me feel like ‘a silly woman’ as I have been made to feel at other garages.
3/29/18,5,Excellent service as per normal
3/29/18,5,Excellent all round service from Inchcape UK. keeping up the very high standards set by H A Fox.
3/29/18,5,"Good all round service, the guys here have the knowledge and experience to deal with all sorts of issues. Plus free pick up and delivery if you are at work."
3/29/18,5,"After difficulty getting past the central call centre and finally raising the staff in the Stratford Upon Avon Branch, the service of my car was smooth and excellent."
3/29/18,5,"Booked in for a service, was completed earlier than the specified time. Faults found that I wasn't aware of, luckily all under warranty and repaired at the same time.
Staff very welcoming, pleasant and polite."
3/29/18,5,All good -got lift to station and friendly service
3/29/18,5,"Quick, efficient and friendly service. No problems with this company."
3/29/18,5,Great service provided by Deborah at Inchcape. Everything fully explained and health cheque provided
3/29/18,5,"purchased a used car from inchcape in guildford surrey.
the salesman was very well informed about the car , and took lots of time explaining all the most important technicalities of the car itself .
the company gave me a very good part exchange deal, so am very happy with the level of service overall provided.
am delighted with the new purchase , and will definitely go to them again in the future"
3/29/18,5,Excellent customer service as usual. Kept updated with a video sent showing works being carried out.
3/28/18,5,"Maidstone Audi were very professional in dealing with my service, as usual. I was met by Emily Jenkins, who was helpful and informative and showed me to my courtesy vehicle for the day.
The service was completed and car valeted, on time, and the whole experience was very slick and problem free. Thank you Inchcape!"
3/28/18,5,Excellent customers service and feedback. Offered express service which was complete before midday and waited in comfortable lounge which had nice coffee machine. Nothing was too much trouble. Many thanks Stuart
3/28/18,4,Did the work quickly while I waited. Good communication including video of the inspection
3/28/18,1,"The customer service is literally shocking. I'd get a better customer service wearing a Manchester United top in the Liverpool FC fan shop in Anfield - served by the die hard fans. At least this way they'd actually acknowledge my existence!
My car was in for an MOT and service, with my wife using a courtesy car (previously arranged way in advance - been stung here before). We advised that I should be contacted so that I could contact my wife to return with the courtesy car (school teacher working 45min away and cannot answer access her phone).
Having received no contact I phoned reception at 15:40 for an update. The agent dealing with my car was busy so the receptionist say she'd left a note to phone me back. I phoned again a subsequent 4 times over the next hour having the same conversation...then gave up and left work to physically go there. Expecting to see a sea of customers waiting to be seen - I was shocked to only see one. ONE! With what looked like 4 agents free - why couldn't one of them phoned me back / taken my call?!
I still had to wait 10 minutes to be seen by ""my agent"", who was very helpful and nice, though when I asked him whether he knew I'd phoned 5 times, he was completely unaware...Shocked!
The communication breakdown for two reception desks, 20ft away from the agents desk is frankly appalling. A child could literally do a better job. This is 100% not worth the significant extra I pay to have my car MOT'd and Serviced at BMW. I wonder how Audi / Mercedes experience compares..."
3/28/18,2,"Having had my Toyota Avensis serviced at Toyota Basingstoke for the last 8 years and have always had great service I have been very disappointed by the service on the last 2 occasions. The first occasion was when Toyota reported to me that my top cover was cracked and it would cost £205 to replace it. As they are the only people that have ever worked on my car I would hold them wholly responsible. On the second occasion I noticed the cover over my battery has not been replaced, again I had the stock reply nothing to do with them. As I am considering changing my car soon I will certainly avoid Inchcape in the future."
3/28/18,5,"Very helpfull staff, listened to my requirements. Worked around my work schedule for appointments to test drive & sort out paperwork. David was very helpfull & informative"
3/28/18,5,Excellent first experience could not fault the service I received. First class!
3/28/18,5,Excellent service
3/28/18,1,"My car was booked in for a routine service and first MOT.

Garage called to inform the car was ready and upon collection had failed to carry out MOT and the car when handed over was covered in soap suds.

In fairness when pointed out they did rectify the cleaning and also arranged to collect the car the following week to carry out the MOT, but all this meant time off work and added frustration."
3/28/18,3,"I was hoping my car's MOT would be completed by 4pm. Terry said he would do his best to make this happen and would ring to confirm.
I cycled to Thames Ditton from Wimbledon arriving at 4pm even though I hadn't been informed of the status of the work. Terry was apologetic that there had been 22 cars presented for an MOT and that my car might not be completed till the next day. Essentially they had over booked. The work wasn't completed until 6.10pm. I would have hoped that the workshop and bookings would have been better organised in order that my car was ready at least by 5.30pm. However, I'm grateful to Terry and the technicians that it was fitted in as the last car of the day, as I was driving to France the next day. The service staff, receptionists and sales people (Malcolm) are v welcoming. At least there were lots of cars to look at and sit in to while away the waiting time."
3/28/18,5,Excellent customer service with Jeff Pym. My second time with this garage and Jeff
3/28/18,4,"Good service and, other than some slight niggles with car computer settings on return, seamless process including pick up and delivery back after."
3/28/18,5,"Excellant compay, and Stephen Williams was great in helping us to get exactly what we wanted. Couldn't have wished for a better service."
3/28/18,5,very pleasant.
3/28/18,3,Arrived for a 10:20 hrs service slot but the car was not taken through until around 11:00 hrs which was disappointing & wasted time as I had no choice but to wait. Parking at the site was absolute rubbish & following the service the car was parked nose into a bay with cars close behind which caused significant issues getting out of the bay. The car had been washed but for some reason there was mud/dirt splatterings on the outside as if it had been driven through a dirty puddle.
3/28/18,5,"NIce welcome space to work whilst waiting for service, and plenty of coffee."
3/28/18,2,"Poor from start to finish. Audi cam pointless as they don't follow up on the services you've requested of them. Apparently sales staff couldn't apraise a car in nearly 6 hours as they were very busy and the shop door broke meaninv hey couldn't access the car, I mean what's up with using the actual door from the showroom to the workshop! To top it off didn't close the bonnet on the car, setting off dashboard light so my mother 64 years old had to do that. Phoned in to complain to the manager that agreed catalog of errors n overall a poor example from them plus 18 grand down on a potential sale!! Don't use!"
3/28/18,5,"Straightforward discussion, negotiation and delivery of new vehicle."
3/28/18,5,"Excellent service. I was well looked after, seated, cup of tea, etc. Golf service carried out as asked plus additional freebies of air-con regas & brake fluid change. Very good value for money."
3/28/18,5,Excellent company
3/28/18,4,Good communication before my car was picked up. Came back fully serviced and nice and clean. Only negative was it looked like it had been driven through some cement? which had completely splashed up on the 2 front doors from the front wheels.
3/28/18,5,Excellent service from beginning to end. Professional with a personal touch I would recommend their services to anyone. I could not be more delighted with my new Mini Cooper.
3/28/18,5,Staff couldn't be more helpful. Car runs beautifully after a service and the valeting makes it look years younger ( thinking of putting myself in for the same service)
3/28/18,5,I actually felt this was the best I have ever been treated by a Motor Dealership/Garage. The staff were exemplary and very attentive. I would definitely recommend Cooper BMW Sunderland.
3/28/18,5,"The salesman I dealt with, Chris was fantastic. He was more than happy to allow the decision to take place at my pace, we took a test drive without any pushy sales when we got back, explored finance options and even though I decided to finance the car with another lender the rest of the sale experience did not change at all. I am delighted with the car (M140i) and the experience in general. Chris is a credit to the business."
3/28/18,2,"Amanda Foreman was the only person who I would give a good review for , car was due to be cleaned thoroughly after they didn’t clean it all all last time I was in . This didn’t happen this time, outside ok but inside looked like they had spent 2 minutes with a hoover. Arrived to collect car and found it hanging half way out into the road not in an allocated parking space . Where it could have been easily hit by a vehicle . And the passenger side door trim hanging out of the door which had been pulled of, complained and Amanda is ordering a new trim , other than Amanda another very poor service from Volkswagen Chelmsford"
3/28/18,5,Excellent service in every way from start to finish.
3/28/18,2,"I left my car in for a service and arranged to pick it up the next morning at 8.30 am. I waited until 9.05 for the car to be ready when I was assured everything would have been done the day before and i would simply have to pick up the keys and pay the next day. Cooper also said they would wash the car, they hosed the bonnet and roof but left the sides and back!"
3/27/18,5,"I found myself in a spot of trouble when my old car died on me.
In between working and moving house - I had to try and get myself a new car sorted ASAP.
I was dealt with by Victor and Neil at Audi Inchcape. They recognised my predicament and kindly went through all of the options available to me.
At no stage did I feel like like I was being conned or ripped off (as I had felt when speaking to other Audi garages or leasehire companies).
They gave me an extremely competitive offer on an A3 AND arranged for the paperwork to go through in a speedy manner.
Neil stayed late at the end of his shift - just to show me all of the ins and outs of the car and to carefully go through the paperwork with me.
Excellent, friendly service with competitive prices and I will definitely be using them again in the future."
3/27/18,5,Well looked after and well informed
3/27/18,1,"Been using mercedes benz of Oxford now for over 13 years
And this is the first time I've had a bad service mainly because of the service man David Johnson talking to me like I'm an idiot and being very rude in his manner when I asked him if the faults I asked them to check had been fixed"
3/27/18,5,Absolutely excellent service. Very pleased with standard of workmanship and outstanding customer service.
3/27/18,5,Excellent service throughout from my call to book the car in for service to the time of driving away from the garage. A first class experience. Many thanks indeed.
3/27/18,4,My car was serviced while I waited very helpful great video on line of my car being looked over
3/27/18,5,"Quality staff through the business, do
What they say they are going to do. Lovely atmosphere in the whole
Place, orderly, busy, chic and well
it's Audi."
3/27/18,5,Couldn't fault the service and the coffee was great
3/27/18,5,Very straight forward process for buying a new car. Hassle free with no quibble over part exchange - they paid what we had expected.
3/27/18,5,"Very friendly people, everything was perfect when picking my car up, would definitely buy a car from there again"
3/27/18,5,Efficient service all round. Polite and helpful staff. I especially liked the video of the vehicle check. Very accommodating to the specific requests I needed to make.
3/27/18,5,"I have used Coopers to service all the BMWs I have owned in recent years. The servicing is always done rigorously and I have never had reason to complain. Staff are obliging and helpful and their ""collect and deliver service"" is a big plus for me. Highly recommended."
3/27/18,5,"Employees - Will and ED - What can I say?! They were exceptionally professional and even when things didn't go according to plan, they resolved it quickly and diligently. 5 star service!"
3/27/18,5,"Great service from Eddy Greenhaugh, very knowledgeable and helpful through all stages of the purchase.
Felt to be a very valued customer, much better experience with this purchase than our previous purchase in 2015"
3/27/18,5,"Booking in made easy and on the date I requested.
My BMW was ready on the time I had agreed and nicely cleaned inside and out"
3/27/18,4,"The service I received yesterday by Paul Moore was extremely good. He went out of his way to help me with a couple of small problems I had with my B class. The service was done in the time specified and I was able to read my book with a hot drink. I also appreciated the link to show me the Health Check that was carried out on my vehicle. My only problem I have had over the years of going to Inchcape is with my mobile and email being mixed up with my husbands, who also has a Mercedes, but hopefully this has now been sorted out! Thanks"
3/27/18,1,Booked a service was told an hr to hr n half however when at the garage was told would be longer I already made plans so my car got a service but no wash n vac as I was initially told would happen in the time. On collecting my car I asked if I needed any paperwork was told all was in my car but it wasn’t so I had to return to the garage to collect it. I had sat nav fitted a while back was told I’d get a wash n vac then too my car was washed (2 wheels got missed) but didn’t get a vac. I don’t think the after service is very good.
3/27/18,5,"Absolutely great service from all at Maidstone Audi especially from Ben would looked after me from start to finish. Can’t recommend enough.

Thank you

3/27/18,3,"Premium price for average service....Coopers could only give me a lift one way to work so I had to pay for a taxi later in the day to collect the car....wash and vacuum was awful, my 8 year old could do a better job! Given I spent £625 on a service I would have expected a lift to work both ways and a decent valet...Audi service is slightly better but still feel I don’t get value for money....will use my local garage next time at half the price!!!"
3/27/18,5,"Our first experience with Land Rover and we weren’t disappointed. Paul and David did a phenomal job at handover. A lot of extras to commemorate tha purchase of my new Discovery Sport! I loved the unveiling of my new car, flowers, and other gifts - I really felt spoilt! Thanks so much and look forward to a wonderful relationship!"
3/27/18,5,"Excellent service by Samatha Collins , was very happy with my visit ."
3/27/18,5,A very enjoyable experience made easier with the help from Martin Pearce 🙂
3/27/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish - car collected and returned valeted with full explanation of work carried out.
3/27/18,4,"The inspection of my vehicle was very thorough but I was disappointed that after dropping my car off at 8.30 am , I did not receive any information about the work required until late in the day around 5pm ."
3/27/18,5,"My service was handled by Nathan . He was very polite , understanding & efficient. all aspect of my car's service was on time and done very well . I do recommend Mercedes Benz of Oxford."
3/27/18,5,"SERVICE FROM MERCEDES BENZ COVENTRY WAS EXCELLENT. ITS A PITY, HOWEVER, THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE MECHANICAL FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM OF MY WIFE'S GLC WILL NOT BE FIXED AND THE SOLUTION, ALBEIT TEMPORARY, IS TO CHANGE THE TYRES!"
3/27/18,5,Thank you to James in service for a great experience. Came in 40 mins early and was seen to with no problem. Updated along the way with the progress.
3/27/18,1,I brought my car in to diagnose the check engine light. I was informed that the issue was with the timing chain and would cost >£1k to sort. I did not get the work done then but when my car was brought around for me the engine was in such awful condition that I barely made it 400 meters down the road before the engine would not start and I had to call a recovery vehicle. On returning to the garage I was informed only then that this could have happened at any moment with this issue.
3/27/18,5,Lauren the sales executive at cheshire oaks was brilliant. She listened to our requirement and tailored the perfect deal. She kept us well informed from order through to delivery. I would definitely recommend and have already told friends and family who are getting in touch with Mercedes cheshire oaks.
3/27/18,3,Gave me a dirty courtesy car
3/27/18,4,"The initial contact was great, the guy on the end of the phone was extremely helpful. This continued once I arrived with my car to have the brakes done, from reception, to service & likewise when I collected my car, everyone concerned was polite, helpful & very professional.
However, I also wanted to speak with new car sales about the purchase of a private vehicle, utilising 'PCH' (personal leasing), again the initial contact with the sales guy was great, but the person who knew all about 'PCH' never showed ..... Not good!"
3/27/18,5,"Easy to deal with and no problems, would definitely use them all again."
3/27/18,5,Family member lost their car key. Very helpful in explaining the process and quick in ordering replacement and deactivating the lost key.Took me 10 minutes at the garage! Very easy
3/27/18,5,"Excellent service for my service; car collected and dropped off, cleaned an valeted, kept well informed"
3/27/18,5,"The staff at Volkswagen are polite, friendly and efficient. The work carried out is of a high standard. Everybody makes you feel important."
3/27/18,5,"Happy Customer!
I couldn't ask for better service, I was seen promptly when I dropped the car off in the morning. I got the car back earlier than expected clean and ready to go.
Thanks team"
3/27/18,5,"I bought a new car from Crawley Audi.
Hannah Smith kept me appraised of the progress of my car throughout the build process. The handover went very well and we were treated professionally and courteously by all the staff at the dealership- including Hannah’s manager - ‘Mo’.
Many thanks to all involved."
3/27/18,4,Experience was made better and was very smooth helped by a very good professional salesman Marco Roberts would highly recommend him and Jaguar
3/27/18,5,"We first contacted Yasmin Bergmanis at Cooper Chelmsford as we had found a car on line. She very kindly tracked the car down in Durham. We went to Chelmsford (we live in Kent) and discussed the matter with Thomas Gaiety, who arranged for the car to be bought down by transporter. When the car arrived, there were various issues that Thomas was not happy with so he arranged for these issues to be rectified and we arranged to collect the car. When we actually saw the car we were very pleased indeed, it was an ex-demo model, 9 months old, but it looked brand and new and in perfect condition. Yasmin actually did the hand over, but Thomas spent time with us ensuring that we were more than happy with our new car, which we were. We found both Yasmin and Thomas extremely courteous and helpful, they couldn't do enough for us, we left Cooper Chelmsford very happy indeed with our beautiful new car! Sincere thanks to both Yasmin and Thomas, we wish you well for the future."
3/27/18,5,"Excellent service, dry professional. Very very impressed."
3/27/18,5,"We have been a customer of Land Rover for several years.
We always find them to be friendly knowledgable and v efficient
Their aftercare is excellent and by far the best of any top end
Garage we have previously used"
3/27/18,5,"From the second I walked in I was welcomed very friendly and seen to straight away, all my questions were answered straight away I would recommend this mess to anyone."
3/26/18,5,"Good company, nice people, I would certainly use them again"
3/26/18,5,"From the moment that we entered the Lexus Derby showroom we were dealt with in a courteous friendly and professional manner. We were made to feel important while at the same time unpressurised , following a test drive with Andrew in a CT200h a deal was put together for our consideration. Following further discussions to come to an acceptable position for us a deal was struck. The whole experience was made very pleasant by the approach taken to customers by all personnel involved . On arriving to collect our new vehicle everything went very smoothly and again we were made to feel very valued as a new customer.
We had heard good things about this dealership from friends who clearly also had a similar experience."
3/26/18,5,"I dealt with Tom and he was fantastic from start to finish! There was no pressure selling or any attempt to sell a stock vehicle or something not to my specific specification and that is refreshing to see when you hear about car sales being on the decline in recent months.

I said what I was looking for and the first thing I did was go out on a test drive and then ask any questions I had about the car and the deal I wanted to pursue... I then took it upon myself to go further and put my order in and I wouldn’t have done that if I was put under pressure to buy a car there and then.

I was given a fair part exchange value for my existing vehicle and I was kept up to date throughout the whole process of ordering my car and taking delivery and I was made to feel very special on collection day!

Overall I can’t fault Tetbury Audi or Tom and I am looking forward to my ongoing relationship with the dealership.

Thanks again Tom!"
3/26/18,2,"Had to remind the service reception that I had extended warranty for a faulty central locking issue.Still waiting for a resolution weeks later,despite several phone calls."
3/26/18,5,"Excellent customer service, I found the staff to be very helpful and I would highly recommend them."
3/26/18,5,This was my first service at Tunbridge Audi. Great customer service and good facilities if you want to sit and wait. Car was cleaned and handed back at the time they said it would
3/26/18,5,Thank you to Alex at Cooper Thames Ditton! I love my new mini and everything was very straightforward!
3/26/18,5,"If you want a car go to chris davies..... simply outstanding service, well informed, professional and cannot do enough to help ...."
3/26/18,5,"could not be more helpfull,
tryed hard to sell us the car,which we are pleased with."
3/26/18,5,"Martyn Harvey was very professional on every level, nothing was too much trouble and he devoted ample time during the sales process and on collection. Martyn was knowledgeable and had prepared everything well in advance of our arrival dedicating 2 hours to our vehicle handover so that I felt entirely comfortable driving away in my new car."
3/26/18,4,The service team are on the whole very good.
3/26/18,5,"Just had my XF serviced here they are fantastic. Honest, reliable, having watched the new car sales team at work too I will definately buy my next car from them. A+++++"
3/26/18,5,"Jag HA fox Preston have always been fantastic. I work abroad so sometimes it can be a deal to sort things from being away. HA fox are great at setting things up for me through email and always look after there customers.
My car has just had major service and it drives like new. They don’t push for a hard sale and simply provide good service from start to finish.
My wife has had a merc from new purchased through an authorised dealer and I can say both the car and after service have been shocking. Maybe the big German brand should send their guys to jag so they can a thing or two. I’m now looking at purchasing a 2nd jag for my wife and can honestly say that we will no doubt be Jag drivers for a long time yet.

Well done jag and particular thanks to Emily and Jamie at the Preston branch.
My wife dreads going into merc but stated to me that the staff at Preston looked after her from start to finish.

Thanks
Mr Adair"
3/26/18,5,Love dealing with Audi and the personal touch they give to their customers when it's an Mot or service.
3/26/18,5,"Car collected on time. One hour later Steve the mechanic sent me an e mail showing car on ramp and talking through all procedures. An hour later car returned, cleaned and valeted. Excelent."
3/26/18,4,"I have a 10 year old Merc stealerships usual give me fright with the service costs on a 3k car.
I can say these people are friendly and informative I get to dream in the showroom when I win the lottery moments
Oil and filter cost what 15 quid ? £144.00 later I'm done happy to pay the rates and a nice little stamp in the book which is worth something right?
Avarage value but buy a car original big bucks the service follows to the grave"
3/26/18,4,"Overall, I received a very straightforward and comprehensive service from both the sales and finance representatives. Pre delivery service from Marvin Mills, the sales rep, was was crisp, friendly, non-pressured and time appropriate. However, the actual car handover itself took too long with me waiting 5 to 10 minutes between various steps in the process, so overall almost two hours rather than the one indicated when fixing the appointment. Otherwise I'd have awarded 5 stars."
3/26/18,4,Very helpful.
3/26/18,5,"This was my first time service at Inchcape.The staff were very welcoming and warm in approach. Few things which need sirtjng out but have agreed to collect my car from workplace and drop it off later which fits well around my work schedule.
I would highly recommende this place:"
3/26/18,5,"Mini Cooper York are very courteous they do not oversell and respect you as a customer.

The show room is a comfortable environment and iinviting. All the staff are friendly and ensure time spent there is pleasurable and offering of coffee was very welcome.

Overall a 5 star existence to what seemed a daunting process of buying a new car . Thanks to Stacy Sales Advisir and the team this was not the case. Stacy spent time ensuring I was happy with what I purchased and went to great lengths to make sure I had made the right choices with her vast knowledge of the mini I was buying.

Thankyou Cooper York . 5 star experience."
3/26/18,5,Excellent customer service from start to finish. Friendly and welcoming staff who go the extra mile to ensure all is done to the customers satisfaction. Would recommend to anyone.
3/26/18,5,very efficient and helpful staff
3/26/18,1,"I asked as to the condition of a used Range Rover prior to committing to the vehicle. David Mulberry, Sales Executive, responded explaining to me the high standards that their used cars were prepared to, multi-point safety and quality check etc. When I went to collect the vehicle, that very same day, the boot wouldn't open as the mechanism wasn't functioning. The drivers door trim was hanging off, moss was growing on the window seals, the rear bumper had a dent and there was a large stain, water mark, covering half of the passenger door panel lining. The dealership explained that the vehicle was indeed not meeting their very high standards and offered to put things right. They took the vehicle away and repainted the drivers door etc. When I went to view the vehicle a second time the door was a different colour. Perhaps I was unlucky in my experience but if it was me, I'd take my business elsewhere - as I write this I am awaiting the return of my deposit."
3/26/18,5,Well looked after without being pushy. Second car we have bought from Guildford Inchcape. Reasonable prices and felt we were listened to.
3/26/18,5,Very warm greeting at reception.Service very professional and efficient as usual.. Well done you.!
3/26/18,5,"my experience with the company was excellent, everything was fully explained, with a satisfactory outcome, the handing over of my new vehicle (XE 30t) was completed in a professional way, It is pleasing to know there is a follow up in place. Clive gave an excellent service throughout

Thank you"
3/26/18,3,"Too long to drop off my keys, far too long waiting to pick up my car again after service. Process needs to be streamlined."
3/26/18,5,"Bought new mercedes from them.Very efficient and got good discount.The salesman Tom,knew his stuff and loved the AMG product.Would highly recommend them!"
3/26/18,5,"Elliot was Super, my brief was clear as to what I wanted and what I could afford and it would be great if I could come away with a good deal as well. mission accomplished ""we will make this happen"" were Elliots words, and he did, probably one of the easiest car purchases I've ever done. I'll definitely be back when our other car needs replacing"
3/26/18,4,"I brought my car in for an MOT, the appointment time was good, the check in process good, although I did have to wait. A complimentary Health Check was carried out and no problems found, so I felt that this was not used as a means of revenue generation. The car was ready on time however as with the check in, even though the check in receptionist was working very hard, I had to wait to check the car out.
Overall this was a good experience, perhaps a review of the check in and check out process would have made it excelent !!"
3/26/18,3,"My Class has just had its B3 service and MOT done at Inchcape, no complaints about the work done but I had to wait ages to get the car back, it sat on the forecourt for nearly an hour before anyone thought to bring me the keys, I had to ask twice. Staff are friendly enough, I was a bit shocked at the language of one the younger females who was with a customer she obviously knew, calling people tw*ts and f**ing this f**ing that. Not what I would I expect from MB."
3/26/18,5,"Walked into the Nottingham showroom to have a look around, Bilal was very personable and helpful and managed to arrange a test drive in the model I was looking for. I found a better deal online but returned to speak to Bilal and the team were able to put something together for the same vehicle which was great.
The welcome and arrival of the car was fantastic, made to feel really special and even unveiled the motor which was great. Fantastic experience for a first time Mercedes-Benz buyer and what a car!"
3/26/18,5,Very well looked after by sales person Jon Taylor. Easy and no pressure.
3/26/18,4,"First service and it was very well done. Only one little snag, all my settings had been changed and it took me a while to reset everything!"
3/26/18,5,James was very nice and helpful. I got a good deal and very happy with my car and the service I received.
3/26/18,1,Unfortunately I was over charged and the car hadn't been cleaned and vacuumed inside as promised........................
3/26/18,5,The service undertaken was excellent... very good communication and help from staff. A very satisfied customer....Thank you Toyota in Basingstoke.
3/26/18,4,Nice idea to call you in for a pre-warranty check and complete the MOT at the same time. I would like to see Cooper Mini be a little more competitive on the MOT price though 😁
3/26/18,5,Fantastic service from Nick Barker. He really did listen to us and gave us the best option suited to us. Fantastic experience. Would highly recommend.
3/26/18,2,"4 series convertible, left at Cooper Cobham at 7.30 am for iDrive software update, as system had been dropping out persistently. Was told to expect a call with estimated completion time. Call received early afternoon, advising me I would be called later with estimated time. No call received. Decided to return to dealer at 5.30. Was told car was ready. No apology for not calling. Then keys could not be found. Waited maybe 25 minutes to locate keys. Apology only from technician, not from my service adviser. When I checked the software, I still couldn't get Bluetooth to function. Returned to service reception - so now after 6pm - to be told to keep trying and if still not working to book it in again. Still no apology from service adviser. Not very impressive."
3/26/18,5,As a member of the toyota club i was able to take advantage of the courtesy car which can be pre- booked.vital if you have children to pick up after school. I also found the video of the health check useful and will be booking it in for the pads when toyota have advised. Safety is always first where family are concerned.
3/26/18,3,The dealer was very busy when I picked my car up. I sat for at least 5 minutes in service reception before anyone acknowledged me. I had to ask what had been found with the faulty door mirror (part will have to be ordered in). Otherwise fine. I had to wait for some new wiper blades to be fitted which had been ordered online following the service video but no-one had looked at their emails.
3/26/18,5,MOT and service. arrived before opening time but member of staff opened up and took my keys. Work all done on time and car cleaned inside and out
3/26/18,5,"Great customer service, nice staff."
3/26/18,5,"We have used Cooper Norwich MINI for the last 6 years and have bought 3 new cars from them. We have always dealt with Noel, who is always welcoming and provides exceptional customer services and new car deals."
3/26/18,5,"First class service, both friendly and very helpful. I appreciated the fact that the salesman was not trying to push extras that I didn't want. It's the first time that I didn't feel as though I had been slightly conned when leaving a car showroom."
3/26/18,5,Excellent communication and service.
3/26/18,5,I have received exceptional service from the moment of first contact through Carwow to delivery. Thank you so much
3/26/18,4,"This was the cars first annual service. The service staff were friendly, but having paid into a service plan for 12 months and given the observed time taken (less than 1hr engineer effort) plus report information provided it is difficult to judge value for money for what was simply and engine oil/filter change."
3/26/18,5,"Shopped around Mini dealerships from Roachdale to Harrogate and then Teesside who I found the most competitive and helpful.
Changing my original order was not a hardship to them and the whole experience was an easy one
My sales advisor Samantha Charnock was brilliant from start to finish. She kept me updated on any queries I had and made handover a smooth transaction. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the dealership or this particular sales advisor to anyone wanting to buy a Mini!"
3/26/18,5,"I have always found Inchape VW at Romford to be extremely professional and their client care to be excellent.

I could take my vehicle to a VW garage nearer my home but I prefer to drive to Romford because of the care and attention I receive from the staff."
3/26/18,5,Could not fault the service I received highly recommend for other people
3/26/18,3,"The site was chaotic, with nowhere to park. OK, some building work was going on but the organisation of shunting cars around could have been much better. Getting a car serviced is a necessary inconvenience. Half an hour just to drop the keys off and be sweet talked by a customer service agent, come on, this is customer service that's gone way over the top. Similar upon return and I had to sit & wait whilst the paperwork was done. Expectations would be 5 mins. to drop off the keys & 10 mins to be given the paperwork & pay, not 30 mins each time. The actual service appeared to have been done well."
3/26/18,5,"Excellent staff and help from the sales team at Inchcape Swindon - Ashley and Mani. Very good commitment to some challenging specification issues that Audi themselves had thrown up and much better than the Audi online help and chat line which was simply not forthcoming.

Would recommend."
3/26/18,5,Team work excellent
3/26/18,5,"First class service from start to finish. Fantastic MINI, fantastic price, fantastic service. Huge thanks to Tim at Cooper Tonbridge for such a great buying experience. Thrilled!"
3/26/18,5,The experience from start to finish was excellent and professional. It is my first Audi and I'm very impressed!
3/26/18,4,The car collect scheme worked excellently
3/26/18,1,Never returned calls. Arrived to collect the car when I told them I wouldn’t be available. Disappointing.
3/26/18,3,"Great experience when buying the car. Lovely fresh coffee and muffins. Great salesman.
Only had the car 12 hours and had to go back to the garage, no lights or indicator’s working.
Not great for a brand new out of the showroom Mercedes-AMG."
3/26/18,5,Friendly & professional staff. Courtesy car ready when mine dropped off and notification when service was complete. Upon collection there was explanation of the service and the car bought to the front of the premises for handover.
3/26/18,5,Took my car their for an MOT I chose to wait on site. I must say I was looked after with an offering of coffee and biscuits and above all the service was great the receptionists were lovely and very nice a great experience
3/26/18,5,"Lovely staff at Inchcape Derby, great service. Can't recommend them highly enough."
3/26/18,5,Excellent service
3/26/18,5,"Bought new X5 from Cooper Croydon, great service from Chris and the team.
will be happy to buy my next car from them"
3/25/18,1,"On 28 Feb 18, I part exchanged my Mercedes for a c200 sport. I was told by the member of staff the first owner was Mercedes HQ and not a Hire firm. This was not the truth. When I received the log sheet it states a Hire firm was the first owner??. I am still waiting for my old car to be untaxed so a refund will be due. I have not received any paperwork from Mercedes finance. I have made phone calls to Mercedes Oxford, they have told me they will get these sorted.. TODATE I HAVE HAD NO REPY. I have also contacted customer services at HQ
COME ON MERCEDES, BE PROFESSIONAL"
3/25/18,3,"I have just took collection of my 4th Mercedes in the last 6-7yrs and I'm not sure what is going on at the showroom. Upon arrival each time there has been absolute chaos trying to get a parking speck (even with the recent hired hands trying to assist outside). It was a real test of my driving skills to park without clipping/ hitting another vehicle. Once inside and sat in the waiting area the coffee machine was not working on the first occasion and there was sugar, wrappers and spilt milk on the counter and an overflowing bin at the side. Upon next visit I had my coffee in a paper cup (what happened to the crockery??) and not even a Lotus biscuit (trivial I know but these little things add up). The glass display cabinet there was thick with dust on the shelves and looked a disgrace. Even the way the vehicles where dotted around did not look good and the AMG section looked like an abandoned warehouse. To sum it up it all felt ""tired and worn out"".
As usual Martin Gardner was his very helpful self and the car is superb, but the showroom experience needs improvement. This time I did not feel like I was ""somewhere a bit special"".
Hopefully this was just a blip as generally I can't fault a thing."
3/25/18,5,"Everything went smoothly from ordering until I received the car. I was kept informed at every stage where the order was up to. All the staff I dealt with were very helpful and polite. I am delighted with my new car although getting to grip with all the gadgets is a little daunting, but I will get there eventually."
3/25/18,5,Excellent customer service from start to finish.
3/25/18,5,"Excellent service,first class was in a rush but wish I had taken names,especially the gent who had my bill ready and the lady who I first spoke on the phone couple of days before I came in,then she came and spoke to me as I was running late.Thank you all again."
3/25/18,1,"I have now had several bad experiences of poor customer service at Inchcape Exeter. The staff are not welcoming or friendly. They salesmen are con artists who are only interested in customers who walk in ready to pay for their pre-chosen car, they dont want to help - unless they can sell you a brand new £30k plus car which they will repeatedly try to do even if you have said no!! Their trade in prices are shockingly low and almost offensive. The servicing and warranty packages are a joke as they try to wriggle out of anything they can quoting T&Cs at you constantly. Even the receptionists try to scare you by saying if you bring in your car and the works not covered you have pay a fee even if you decide to fix the issue elsewhere. This week I twice enquired about trading in my current Golf for a Tiguan and no one came back to me and now I see they sold my chosen car so guess I am not a good enough customer. Think I might take my money across to Audi from now on!!"
3/24/18,5,"Great service, very friendly and highly professional."
3/24/18,5,good service
3/24/18,5,Arranged a Service & MOT for my C Class over the phone following Inchcape's email reminder. Brought the car in and liaised with Kate. The Technician found an oil leak from a seal on the automatic gearbox. The seal had been replaced when the gearbox oil had been renewed as part of the service schedule 2 years ago. Kate liaised with Mercedes Head Office and resolved the situation as I have been on a service plan with Inchcape for the past 7 years. All I had to pay for on the day was the MOT. Many Thanks
3/24/18,5,Took my e class into Mercedes Oxford for an airbag recall. I waited for around 90 minutes and my car was returned valeted and with a ‘health check’ with brake pad and tyre wear measurements plus a general condition report. All FOC and efficiently dealt with. Would recommend.
3/24/18,1,"AVOID! Took my car in with a misfire fault what turned out to be an fuel injector. The injector was replaced ‘at a steep price’, took the car home noticed light scratches on the paint work where somebody had scrubbed at it when they had cleaned it. Also noticed a slight judder in the car which led me to believe the car was still not running correctly. Before I returned the car i had a diagnostic ran on it by another person to wich a fault was found.
Car was returned to them and sent home another 2 times telling me it was fine. Finally when i got an engine light come on they admitted it was not.
Unsure what the actual fault is tho they were willing to charge me to keep changing parts guessing until they got to the problem, if i had agreed god knows how much it would of cost! So i have come away still with a fault 3 months down the line.
Even making a booking was a farce with this place. Confirmation email was a totally different car meaning i had to phone back up. Nice work guys."
3/24/18,5,Great friendly service who where more than happy to help. Stuart was very helpful from start to finish of getting my new car. Highly recommended
3/24/18,4,Easily booked in for MoT that was completed ahead of time. Excellent service. Thank you.
3/24/18,2,"Booked in to have my car service and mot on the 22nd March at 9.00am. Phoned coopers of Chelmsford the day before to check how long it would take, was told mot was booked for 12.00 o,clock and it would take about 1 hour and the service would start at 10.00 o,clock which would take about 2 hours therefore it would be finished between 1.00 and 1.30pm. Arrived at 9.45am and was informed by the check in staff the mot was booked for 12.30pm followed by the service this meant it would not be ready till 3.30pm, this was totally unacceptable,the staff and supervisor couldn’t sort it out so I asked to speak to service manager who didn’t seem interested and left it to the supervisor to sort out which he did and assured my wife and myself it would be ready by 1.00 to1.30pm.Livvy informed me when the car was ready and tried hard to redeem the situation trying to get the paperwork done as quickly as possible, but this wasn’t a very pleasant experience,poor customer service and very disappointing."
3/24/18,4,"The booking process, service reception and repairs went well however, I was very frustrated that when I rang to enquiry if the car was ready for collection and could not get an answer. I was promised a call back and nothing happened. I had to ring again. In the end I took a chance and went to pick it up lucky it was ready.
With all the computerisation that exists i.e video inspection etc I would have thought there could have been a simple table of which car are completed and which are work in progress. If there was it would allow the receptionist to answer queries quickly."
3/24/18,5,Brilliant service at Mini Thames Ditton from Alex. Spent a day with him choosing my dream car and he found it for me! I am so happy with it and he was more than helpful making sure I was happy every step of the way!
3/24/18,5,"The service given by Hunters Land Rover Southampton was excellent. From my initial visit, test drive, sales transaction to final delivery the service and attention given was friendly, courteous and effective. I would happily recommend them to friends and family."
3/24/18,5,Good video & service
3/24/18,5,My review of inchcape uk burton on Trent.As you see by my rating score I would recommend this service to anyone.They are very professional and thorough first class.
3/24/18,5,I was called the day before I was due to attend to ensure the timing of my appointment was still convenient and to ensure a full understanding of the reason for my visit. This led to me being made very welcome upon arrival and my vehicle being attended to in a timely manner
3/24/18,5,A big thank you to Audi and Thomas farthing who dealt with me from start to finish. So professional all went so so smooth. Congratulations to Audi and all their staff. Great job will recommend to all friends and family. Thank you all team Audi.
3/24/18,5,"The service department were excellent as were the technicians. Despite being extremely busy they were polite, friendly, down to earth and very knowledgeable."
3/23/18,5,"A fantastic dealership with a showroom to die for.
All staff were immaculately presented.
I particularly recommend the Sales Executive, Kevin Lake - a lovely guy, professional but very approachable.
Needless to say I purchased a vehicle from him."
3/23/18,5,"Excellent service all round. My initial email enquiry was responded to very promptly and from then on everything went very smoothly - within five days I had found exactly the car I was looking for. All the staff were friendly and helpful, especially the used car sales rep Georgette Rydin who explained everything clearly and thoroughly (and even delivered my car to me).

I feel I made the right choice in purchasing my A3 from Crawley Audi and would highly recommend them."
3/23/18,1,"Friday afternoon - Maidstone Audi - Tried to call for replacement windscreen and fitting on RS6. Twice lost in the phone system whilst being sent from person to person. 3rd attempt was told by parts the screen could be ordered in for tuesday, then passed to more 3 people only to be fobbed off and told they'd call me back after 10 minutes which they didn't. I called back after half an hour and sent from person to person again only to be told I'd be contacted by the end of the day which didn't happen. Now the glass order will have to wait until Monday which now means Wednesday/Thursday assuming somebody deals with it Monday.
Shocking service. Will try all over again Monday."
3/23/18,4,"Excellent service. Booking process was extremely easy - got the slot to suit my schedule . Extremely friendly and helpful personnel in the service department .

The car was picked up and dropped on time. Loved the service video sent to me. Car returned spotlessly clean. Thank you very much ."
3/23/18,5,"Order number: 00362740
Order date: 12 March 2018
Very good experience from most aspects, we did have to return to have the in car service record completed, but Natasha dealt with us very well. We hate and detest the spearmint smell you put in the air conditioning, another flavor please, like lavender for example. That apart an altogether reasonable experience."
3/23/18,2,Having arranged a pickup for service and MOT - 1 hour late and no communication/apology. Returned car in dark - no complimentary wash and clean. Will not be returning in a hurry.
3/23/18,5,Good service
3/23/18,5,"This is our first Volkswagon, previously owned Mercedes, I can honestly say that VW far exceeds Mercedes in its customer care and service. I booked the car in for a service as I was texted that it might be due, after I booked it in I had a reminder regarding the appointment the day previously, all good when you get to my age 😀 We dropped the car off at Inchcape in Chelmsford, our customer care agent was James, I cannot stress how good James was, his helpfulness, keeping us informed, sending me a video of the work going on. Really really helpful. Overall a joy to take it in. Thank you all very much."
3/23/18,5,"Very good service all round at VW. Fast, polite, informative, efficient. Great communication. Thanks to Wayne!"

The description and spec of the A1 was as described in advert.

Would return again to purchase from Swindon Inchcape, the best service we have received from and Audi garage."
3/23/18,2,"Being told there was a courtesy car waiting for me, only to arrive and be told I can’t have one completely messed up my day, resulted in me missing work and losing a days pay... car wasn’t cleaned like promised either"
3/23/18,5,I recently purchased my first Audi from the Maidenbower Audi garage. Daniel Smith was our first point of contact and was the most helpful assistant EVER! He kept myself and my dad updated and in the loop though the whole process of searching for the car that was right for me all the way through to buying. Nothing was too much trouble and I really appreciate all of his help! Thank you again!
3/23/18,4,"Thanks Joel for all your help when we bought the TTS. Dedication to duty coming in on your day off, the transaction & handover experience was smooth & efficient. Would use Inchcape Hyde again."

3/23/18,5,everything went perfect. i have a service agreement and hope the next 3 years go as well as this. i have no worries at all.
3/23/18,3,"Car booked in for a major £1kish service, check in easy, simple to find location service team professional and courteous. Lovely shiny gin palace of a place.

Car upon return was washed of a fashion, so poorly that when I opened the boot road salt was still visible, mats had been vacuumed but not under and the dashboard was still dusty and glass needed cleaning.

Also was parked so close to a post that I couldn’t get in with the mirrors folded out. I also noticed a scratch on the drivers door which may explain why so close to the post? I haven’t bothered to complain as it would be impossible to prove so be careful and get them to check your car when you drop it off!"
3/23/18,5,"From start to finish, Adnan was very professional and helpful with the proccess of purchasing my new car. He made my bmw experience very easy and enjoyable."
3/23/18,5,Excellent service & communication. Finished work and returned car at stated time.
3/23/18,5,"I have had BMW cars for around nine years and had had all my servicing done at Coopers, Ipswich. I know a lot of the staff and they are always helpful and friendly. This visit was regarding an MOT and service, which went smoothly and efficiently with no problems. So a very good experience. In addition, I was due to update my vehicle and their Sales Rep quickly found me a great replacement (after a test drive), which I will pick up in due course. So another great experience. Thank you."
3/23/18,5,Vey friendly and efficient service
3/23/18,5,"Superb service as always, and looked after throughout"
3/23/18,1,"Yet again terrible service - how many phone calls do you need for one MOT!

Now I've got another vehicles paperwork, been waiting 3 hrs for someone to call be back!

Unfortunately I like the MOT protection, if they didn't offer this I would not use this terrible garage - Tunbridge Wells."
3/23/18,5,Very good service kept me up to date with progress and value for money
3/23/18,5,Excellent in every way. Has been for the past 17 years. Thanks Roger Brown
3/23/18,5,"Very professional service provided, my Mini Cooper was collected from my home address, taken for a full service. Later in day I received a email with a video link to show me what needed doing. My car was then returned to my home address later in day, and had been cleaned inside and out!

3/22/18,5,"I was given a thorough explanation for the reason of my visit. I and my wife were treated with the utmost consideration and courtesy and were made to feel comfortable. I made a request which was looked into and every effort was made to see to it.
The MOT was completed and the things I had asked to be looked at were all attended to.
We are grateful for the way all staff made us welcome.
The new Jaguars were also mouthwatering to look at."
3/22/18,5,I had an excellent experience from the start of the process to the collection of my new car. The treatment that we received from Malcolm Edwards was second to none and I would have no hesitation in recommending his services.
3/22/18,5,"Very good service, I was kept informed of progress. Would recommend."
3/22/18,5,Service Advisor courteous and professional. Liked the video taken during the Health Check. Nice to see my car had been cleaned inside and out after the completion of the Health Check and MOT.
3/22/18,5,"I booked my car in for a service with Emily from the service team....5 star service from start to finish. A lovely, warm and friendly welcome. Its so nice to see someone at work smiling and who always goes that extra mile in explaining things that i was unsure about.
Such a credit to the maidstone Audi team.
Thank You Emily. X"
3/22/18,5,"Staff kept me informed throughout the day, and my daughter says her car feels much better after the service"

No problems about returning for my next service."
3/22/18,5,Professional staff. Treated politely and with respect.
3/22/18,4,"Took my vehicle into Inchcape Derby for a safety recall on the passengers airbag.
Very efficient at the first instance to book the vehicle in and this carried on during my visit.
I was told this procedure would take 90 minutes and I was offered refreshments during my wait.
Almost exactly 90 minutes later I was back on my way with a freshly washed vehicle.
I even received a video message on my phone from the mechanic looking after my vehicle before I had even left explaining that it had been given a safety clean bill of health.
All in all a very pleasing experience and based on my experience would recommend this dealership."
3/22/18,5,"Mercedes AMG Derby (Inchcape) Simply cannot recommend too highly! Excellent customer experience from first point of contact through to final resolution. This is where you go when all else fail. Go there, even if you have to bypass other dealers, simply the best."
3/22/18,5,"Being a past owner of a jaguar l expect the best and can say l wasn't disappointed. From the moment of walking into the reception, coffee or tea offered l felt at home. The sales team were very informative and as expected new the product well and answered most questions raised, in articular Mr Mark Roberts who handled the purchase of my new Jaguar EPace and showed genuine enthusiasm in the vehicle and my requirements. l have no hesitation in recommending a visit to see the exciting range and in particular the ne EPace"
3/22/18,5,"A very fair price for the work undertaken after ringing round for quotes.
Good booking in service with timed appointment."
3/22/18,5,"Knowledgeable Sales Man.

Ellis was delightful to deal with, he knew his product very well and had an approachable manner.

There was no hard sell which was perfect."

Penny completely captures the essence of first class customer service with her polite, helpful, caring friendly manner :)"
3/22/18,5,"Good support from the sales team.

Very pleased with the vehicle

the only negative I was disappointed to find out I needed to pay £60 to use anything but the basic of features with the bmwconnected app."
3/22/18,5,"The service and assistance I encountered was second to none!!
Over many years I have bought several new cars and found the experience of buying a car at the HA Fox dealership ( Guildford), to be the best, from the welcome at reception all the way through the process, even the coffee was above average !! The whole experience was FIRST CLASS."
3/22/18,5,"I can honestly say that my experience of buying a new car with Land Rover Inchcape exceeded my expectations. From the reception girls, sales staff and managers all made me feel comfortable and not pressured into anything. Giles Uppard was fantastic and gave great advice and I feel answered my questions honestly he was helpful, friendly and I really felt at ease when talking to him. Thanks to Giles at Inchcape and I'm loving the car..see you in a few years for a new one.."
3/22/18,5,Very friendly and efficient service. The service agent was very helpfull

Follow up parts were fitted when said and courtesy car was easily arranged."
3/22/18,4,"Always looked after at Audi Tetbury. Staff always ready to go the extra mile.
Took some hard negotiating to get acceptable deal on new car purchase.
Nice touch of bunch of flowers for wife."
3/22/18,5,Really friendly & helpful; made a chore a thoroughly pleasant experience.
3/22/18,5,first class service by Paul and the team

3/22/18,5,Great from start to finish kept me informed on the build. prepared the car when it arrived looked great when we picked it up full marks to Coopers Bmw.
3/22/18,5,Friendly atmosphere and good service.
3/22/18,4,Excellent service in a brilliant environment.
3/22/18,3,"The dealership was quite expensive but that was expected to be honest.

What was more shocking was the amount of staff milling about in suits not actually serving anyone and the wait times after being initially recepted before being served. Also the parking for customers was non existent although I understand that the day I attended coincided with a “sales event”.

On the plus side the free coffee was quite nice and helped pass the time spent waiting

PS following the reponse below from a inchcape; can I ask did you read my review? Whilst I agree with the comments over costing/quality and knew all about this before my visit main comment was the wait times and the numerous staff milling about (doubtless busy with something BUT not actually serving anyone)and the non existent parking on the day.
The ratio of staff in Audi jackets/suits to customers I would estimate at approximately 4:1

Having said all that I would use Your garage again but allow more time for the drop off/pick up"
3/22/18,1,Give my car back after service with out complimentary wash and without service book stamped !
3/22/18,5,"Efficient service
Front desk very polite
Sorted all issues
Would strongly recommend"
3/22/18,5,"Excellent customer service from Neil Cameron, regularly kept us informed about the status of brand new our Audi A3. Very happy with our purchase."
3/22/18,5,"None pressurised sales, quick and easy transaction and everything occurred within the mutually agreed timeframe. One small defect found on car when picking up however quick follow up action by Rhys Brine (Sales) assured me that the defect would be addressed in a timely and convienient manner which was delivered. Excellent buying experience backed up by great Audi Customer Care which keeps me coming back as a repeat customer. Thank you Rhys and Audi Swindon. Ian Barlow"
3/22/18,5,"Excellent communication and service. Really great waiting lounge with WiFi, hot drinks and charging facilities. Car washed and vacuumed and looks good as new."
3/22/18,5,"I recently bought my car from them and it couldn't have gone smoother, I was offered all sorts of test drives with no obligation, Michael and alvin were very helpful and friendly, and made the whole experience enjoyable and seamless, would definitely recommend them"
3/22/18,5,Great service 10 out of 10 completely satisfied!
3/22/18,1,too awful to write about - I get angry just thinking about yesterday.
3/22/18,5,"Easy to book service using online booking service. Requested my car to be picked up and received phone call to inform me of the timings for this. When the car was picked up I was taken through what would be carried out and my car was photographed. Whilst the car was in for service I received a video of the the vehicle check that was carried out and informed of an extra requirement that needed carrying out. On contacting the service department I was then told of the cost to which I agreed and told them to proceed. Later that day, and earlier than expected, I was contacted to say my car was ready to be returned and then paid for the service. The car was returned shortly thereafter. I was then given a device to set up Volkswagen Connect and shown where it fitted on the car and told of the app to use it on my smartphone. Everything went perfectly and my was also cleaned for me. The two people I was in contact with from the garage could not have been more helpful.. Totally recommend them to anybody for a really professional and easy to use experience."
3/22/18,5,"Had my car serviced yesterday at Preston Farm mini garage Stockton on Tees. Couldn’t have been better! Loan car provided and all aspects of service, from Reception staff to mechanics very professional. Watched and listened to Health check video which was very straightforward. Have been a regular customer of this garage and always had excellent service."
3/22/18,5,Excellent service as always
3/22/18,4,fast and polite check in - a few hours later received a text with a video telling me my car was fine. only issue is that trying to get hold of someone who could me whether I could pick up the car. It took over an hour for someone to get back to me.
3/22/18,3,"Having to wait for a service rep when dropping the vehicle off is tedious and unnecessary, as is the experience when collecting. Reception staff should easily be able to take my key and check my details."
3/22/18,4,"Courteous and efficient welcome and booking in. All details fully explained.
Car cleaned and vacuumed on collection. Again, service explained by Service Manager. Absolutely seamless.
On viewing the supplied short video of my car being ""serviced"", I was told that the rear washer nozzle was missing and could be replaced for £6.30.
My car does not have a rear window wash facility!!!
When I contacted the showroom to ask them to explain this, they just said it was a ""mistake"" on their part. Any other ""mistakes""?"
3/22/18,5,Excellent Very good device will use again
3/22/18,5,"My car was collected from my home address, serviced and returned back to me clean and gleaming on 21/03/18.

All the staff, from the lady and man that collected and returned my car to the mechanic Lewis and Ben, who are all from the Maidstone branch provided an outstanding service.

Polite, professional and helpful.

Thank you everyone, great teamwork!

Kind regards,

Clair Smith."
3/22/18,4,Good service
3/22/18,5,"I have used Inchcape for servicing, repairs and MOT for my Mercedes for many years and have always found the quality of work to be of the highest standard. This coupled with the friendly and efficient receptionists and service team at the Stratford-upon-Avon dealership gives me confidence every time."
3/22/18,4,"Everything was perfect on the day except much longer wait for the service than expected. However, I was slightly compensated for the delay"
3/22/18,5,"My first experience of Jaguar service, really just for software updates. Received a warm reception, coffee, a great courtesy car clean, and the car was ready in the time promised. What's not to like! Wish I had bought Jaguar years ago."
3/22/18,5,"Very polite and welcoming, Service done quickly while I waited in the comfort of the seating area. The schedule was explained to me by the service engineer/representative. Would not hesitate to use them again. Thankyou."
3/22/18,5,"Unfortunately I released that my MOT was over due. Michael the young man on reception managed to squeeze my car in the same day.
The 1.5hrs I was here I enjoyed coffee in the waiting area and was looked after by a team of ladies from there front desk.
My car came back to me washed and vacuumed and a full MOT.
Thank you Cooper Sunderland"
3/22/18,5,"Nick Hawkins was excellent and he pulled out all stops to make sure I gorgie the car I wanted and even better was the timescale in that I took
It away the same day."
3/22/18,5,"Absolutely fantastic service from start to finish. I dealt with Harley Bishop who made everything very easy and answered all my questions very promptly.

Thank you, one very happy customer."
3/21/18,5,"I cannot rate Cooper Malton BMW highly enough, the whole experience was an absolute pleasure. Best of all was the professionalism of the staff and especially Leon who dealt with my every need. Top Class!!"
3/21/18,5,The whole process was smooth from start to finish.
3/21/18,3,They rang me to suggest I had my air conditioning serviced. I agreed and fixed a date. They said it was £79. They were due to collect the car from work but on the day they rang to say they couldn't pick up the car due to staff shortage. We fixed another date but in the meantime I received a text to offer the service for £39. I was impressed that they honoured this but the lady dealing with me told me they weren't always aware of offers being made to customers. I had to ring on the day of the service as it was nearly 12 noon and they hadn't contacted me. They said they were running late. Service went to plan and they even fitted a data plug free of charge. I received the receipt and a service report but unfortunately the latter was for a different car. I rang them the next day to say I had this but it had another customers personal details on it and I would shred it. I asked for a copy of my car's service report and they said they would find it and ring me. I've not heard anything since.
3/21/18,5,Great customer service. Attention pay to the detail as you would expect from BMW.
3/21/18,5,This was my first service for my new 330e. I found the whole experience very easy. My service was completed and I received a call to confirm that my car was ready for collection. Returning the loan car was completely painless along with the chap who completed the paperwork. The car was cleaned inside and out and fully charged! I later received a video from the engineer who confirm that everything was ok with my car with footage of the inspection being completed. Very impressive.
3/21/18,5,I knew exactly which car I wanted and did not feel pushed into changing my mind to get something more expensive. A lot of time on collection day was spent waiting for different staff to come in and explain about servicing and extra insurances. Would have been nice to have seen just one person and been away with the car within an hour instead of two. All in all very happy with the service
3/21/18,3,Would have given 5 stars if complete customer experience was provided
3/21/18,5,Sales man was excellant and very helpful. Got a brilliant trade in for car.
3/21/18,4,"Although the time to fix a faullt was long winded, the customer service and politeness was the excellent. I was not able to be angry over the ongoing issues due to the staff behaviour and respectful manner they spoke to me. Richard potten . Sandhurst garage, excellent"
3/21/18,5,Problem sorted by Elliott and the used car manager and when I htook the car in o was well looked after by Ben from service
3/21/18,5,"I have used Mercedes in Stratford on Avon for many years now and would go nowhere else for keeping my car on the road.
The staff including the mechanics are courteous, well informed, helpful and do a great job.
I have no complaints about the work and any complaints are aimed at MERCEDES BENZ for some of the tariffs they impose on their agents not Stratford Mercedes.
The video report and comprehensive written report is very useful, although, and this is my ONLY grouse that it lists the most insignificant potential problems. If only they would just tell me the important ones and leave the others till required to inform me. This is common throughout Mercedes so is not aimed at Stratford, but is an observation.
Would I recommend Mercedes at Stratford on Avon? The answer is a resounding YES!"
3/21/18,5,"Good personalised service with a friendly and reliable member of staff. Raz was honest about costings and recommendations for the future. Stayed in touch when the car was in the garage. Returned the car with a beautiful shine.

Good luck Raz with the baby in June."
3/21/18,5,"Was able to book the car in without problem on a day that suited me. Didn't ask for a courtesy car or for lift home so can't comment on that.
Dealt with Hannah in the Service dept and she was polite and kept me updated on what was happening.
There was a bit of a wait picking the car up which didn't cause me a problem and the car was washed and vacuumed well."
3/21/18,5,"Staff are all friendly and professional.
Availing the service procedures is seam-free and thorough.
Facilities are top class.
Try as I might I can think of no demerits. (There must be something!
Therefore 9.5 / 10.)"
3/21/18,5,I was greeted by an advisor at the entrance and introduced to the Service Department representative who was managing the work to my car. I was kept informed by video on the internet as the work progressed and phoned when it had been completed. The car was returned serviced and valeted in a timely manner. A first class experience throughout.
3/21/18,5,"No problems, was a very good experience."
3/21/18,5,All car showroom staff make the effort to give good customer service and make the customer happy - the difference at Inchcape is that they obviously mean it and it's not just to get your money or tick some boxes.
3/21/18,5,"Booked my car in for a service and organised a courtesy car only to find out on phoning for confirmation that the previous driver hadn't returned the car as due.
After a bit of a rant Becky found us a little VW UP! which meant we could make our appointment while our car was being serviced - and she waived the insurance charge by way of compensation.

At the end of the day a difficult customer (me) left satisfied and happy with the service I received."
3/21/18,5,"I had the car serviced and valeted. When I arranged the courtesy car, I said that my next car was going to be an automatic and asked if it would be possible to drive an automatic mini. The service department arranged it for me and the whole experience with the dealership was first class."
3/21/18,5,Joe found me a suitable car within my fixed budget and managed the whole process well. I found him very polite and helpful.
3/21/18,5,"Everything completed as agreed, on time and a cleaned car on its return."
3/21/18,5,Brilliant very helpful .good job done
3/21/18,5,Excellent service
3/21/18,1,"For what should be a good experience from Audi and their customer service, I have never been left so angry and disappointed with them!

After taking my car In staying to them that the MMI (centre console) was not powering up, they returned my vehicle after having it for 7 hours telling me exactly what I had told them when I dropped it off and wanting to charge me for the pleasure.

On drop off of the car I was asked if I wanted the engine oil and windscreen washer topped up for £15, I explained that I had a brand new bottle of windscreen fluid in the boot so not to do that but if then engine oil needs topping up then they could do so to which the service advisor replied ‘to be honest we normally just use water anyway’ I questioned him on A) just using water and charging £15 and B) only using water and no anti-freeze in the current climate on below freezing temperatures- to this he just shrugged it off!

Having booked my car in at 08:30am for a diagnostic, I hadn’t heard anything at 12:30pm so I phoned Audi and was told that it had just gone in to be looked at and I would receive a call in around half an hour......3 hours passed with no phone call so I tried again. My advisor was busy so I awaited a call back, a further half an hour passed and I finally heard from him telling me that he MMI is indeed broken and that it could prove tially be the wiring, there was no technician available today to look at the wiring and rather then offer me another day to have that checked out told me that although the technician running the diagnostic had spent around 2 hours on the vehicle they would ONLY charge me £60. I then spent the next 20 minutes on the phone to this advisor asking what exactly they had done to warrant the £60 charge as he was practically repeating the exact information I had told him that very morning. The advisors conduct was rude and unsympathetic.

I appreciate I’m no mechanic but joe bloggs could of told them the same as I had. To lead further to my frustration, he then went on to tell me that it will probably cost me about £2500 to replace the entire MMI system so ‘when do you want to book this in?’ I am a full time working mum, forgive me for not having £2500 just laying around. I explained to this advisor I would need to speak with my partner first before making any decisions and he seemed less impressed at this. My complaints apprehend to be falling on deaf ears and I was just ‘another unsatisfied customer’ which Audi were going to charge me happily £60 for.

On arrival to collect my car, I saw said sale advisor scurry out of the building and a new advisor called me over. She asked me if I had had a nice day and when I explained my disgust at the service Audi had (or had not) provided she appologised, after some more voicing my dismay at the ripping customers off for a ‘diagnosic’ When I still am none the wiser as to the fault, she agreed to waver the £60 fee.

This may seem like a petty review but I was left in total shock and anger as to how any business thinks it’s acceptable to treat there customers in this way and not provide a service they should of been able to, on top of that, they should have offered to have the car back in, included in the £60 original diagnosic to check the wiring.

Well done to the service advisor that agreed to waver the charge, in my opinion this was the correct thing to do on behalf of Audi.

A very unhappy customer"
3/21/18,5,everything according to plan
3/21/18,5,"I booked my car into Mercedes-Benz Nottingham for a full service online. I arrived at 8:00am on the day and found the staff very helpful and efficient. It was explained to me that the branch was very busy and my car would be ready to pick up at 4:00pm. I expected to leave it with them all day anyway. I picked the car up at 4:30 and was pleasantly surprised to find it had been valeted inside and out. I usually do not have my car valeted by anyone but the valet was excellent , the tyres had even been blacked. Oil and brake fluid had been changed with the filters and seals, the instrument cluster had been checked out and the rest of the car checked over and pronounced in good condition. Driving the car home I found the engine to be quieter and smoother. All in all very pleased with the service and treatment at Mercedes-Benz Nottingham."

3/21/18,5,Elle was very efficient in dealing with the service and MOT on our VW Polo
3/21/18,5,"First class service throughout from start to finish. Compared to other local dealers it is refreshing to be dealt with quickly and to see a high degree of service from the personable staff. I don’t remember ever having my car valeted after a MOT inspection before! All in all, a first class service and I will be making this dealer my regular dealer for all servicing requirements in the future. Thank you very much."
3/21/18,5,"My car dealer peter was fab since the first day I inquired about the car to the day I picked it up. He went through all the details of my car, kept me up to date with my enquiries and ensured everything was fine with the car. I would Recommend this company to anyone looking at part exchanging their current car to a new Audi."
3/21/18,5,"The team at Cooper Reading are absolutely fantastic! They are super friendly and make you feel totally welcome, whilst also finding you the perfect car to suit your needs and budget. If you can't quite afford the one you have your heart set on, they'll find a great alternative for you. I've just driven away my brand new M2 and absolutely love it, I never dreamt this would be possible but they guys made it possible. Special thanks to Adam, Will, Abby and Ed!!!!!"
3/21/18,5,Great service received from start to end at Mini Cooper Durham. Attentive to what I wanted and felt at ease throughout the whole process. Would recommend their services to anyone. I was kept informed of my purchase and the status through the whole process and my sales advisor Hannah was great! She kept me informed and was willing to help with anything.
3/21/18,5,No problems whatsoever
3/21/18,3,"Appointment times not kept and new car not ready for collection when we arrived at dealers as arranged.
Manager gave us additional services for future use as means of apology but still disappointed."
3/20/18,5,Great service and communication. Highly recommend for everyone.
3/20/18,2,"Last minute call at about 07:10 to arrange collection, asked for car to be returned by 16:00 LATEST - I had to call to chase at 16:15 and it was not returned until 17:15.... being more realistic with timings and respecting that my busy schedule means that this lack of appreciation of timings is unworkable. Very expensive service! And then not even valeted properly, poorly hovered, no inside clean, and not sure exterior clean ... worst I’ve had with my cars for past 10 years ( but first time with Land Rover) And some basic setting changed ( main lights didn’t work automaticallly ) Disappointing"
3/20/18,5,"Absolutely perfect service, couldn’t have felt more relaxed and comfortable! Highly recommend anyone to have the same salesman! Very knowledgeable and easy to get along with!"
3/20/18,5,"Great service, excellent knowledge of the car and I was taken care of brilliantly. Thank you all."
3/20/18,5,"very happy with service we received ,our salesman jon taylor was outstsanding he was very helpful and guided us through every aspect without feeling under pressure. I am over the moon with my mini countryman .
Thanks jackie"
3/20/18,5,Sarah Clarke st Cooper Cobham was extremely helpful when I was buying a new mini- she made the whole process Stress free and had a very friendly manner .i would highly reccomend visiting this garage.Paul the manager was also extremely approachable and explained the process so I undserstood all the terminology and terms and conditions.
3/20/18,5,Excellent service provided. Have all the information I needed to buy a new Mercedes. From the moment I walked in to when I left with my new car the staff excellent and ensured I was happy with what I was buying. Would recommend Leicester Mercedes to anyone buying anew Mercedes.
3/20/18,5,"Went into Maidstone Audi to just look at Q5s. Very busy showroom but Salesman Darren made the time to help me. He was in no way pushy, very friendly and advised me on different ways of having the car of my dreams. I was a bit of a pain and very impatient but nothing was too much trouble. Just 8 days later I’m driving that dream car!! Seamless from start to finish so I’m a very happy lady. Thank you Darren"
3/20/18,5,I found Harry to be so helpful he was hard working and nothing was too much trouble . I had been thinking about buying a Mercedes but they were too pushy Harry had the right approach to selling cars . I would definitely recommend him to family and friends . The bottle of Moët and Chandon was a wonderful touch and made the whole experience brilliant thank you .
3/20/18,5,"Mercedes Inchcape Leicester,
Excellent service, salesperson very helpful in explaining the multiple options available to suit my needs and the model of car. Changed my mind a few times but he persevered, collected at the weekend when snow was about and he contacted me first thing to up date on road conditions. Very Satisfied.
Mike S"
3/20/18,5,"My first service experience with Incchape. I have to say form arranging a service date to dropping off my car, everything went smoothly. I was kept up to date with the service and notified by call and email of what had been carried out.

Excellent customer care and very impressed with the Service Team."
3/20/18,5,I received excellent service from VW Inchcape - Chelmsford especially as I was able to book my car for routine oil servce on a Saturday morning - James and the service team were very accommodating. They get my full recommendation.
3/20/18,5,very good sevice
3/20/18,1,"Dealing with purchase of the car to buy was initially fine. However, organisation of collection of car was very poor, with consistent lack of communication, failed pick up times, causing much inconvenience and forcing me to keep ringing Audi, not the other way round. No word of apology from anyone when arriving to collect the car, nor was paperwork ready. Explanation of the purchased car was good. I would have thought that the car might have been filled up with petrol. Considering it was my first experience with Audi, and the Swindon centre, I was very unimpressed."
3/20/18,5,"Good, very attentive service given to customers as always."
3/20/18,5,"Could not fault the service received for a first major service and first MOT for vehicle bought just over a year ago .
All organised and completed without fuss or error.
Thanks"
3/20/18,5,"Delays on the road due to snow Monday 19th caused me to be late for my booking placed weeks ago. Staff were amazing across all departments when phoning on route. Understanding and accommodating. Job done in specified time. Efficient, friendly, knowledgeable service. Thanks team."
3/20/18,5,"I have to be honest, my experience of Lexus and their service is exceptional.
The service took around 4 hours so they lent me a car , not any old rubbish, infact it was better than the car that was being serviced!
They dont try and sell you new tyres etc, they give you the facts and tell you how much longer you can use them for.
I was very impressed"
3/20/18,5,As usual first class service no complaints and I collected a clean shiny car big help this time of the year.
3/20/18,5,"As always, attentive staff and brilliant service. Coffee on tap makes the wait pass quicker, but (smile) could have been better with a biscuit and the television a little louder. Thank you"
3/20/18,4,"I am 100% happy with my new Mini.

I had a great 1st visit with Mini as a walk-in customer and Laurenzo (from 2nd hand cars) stepped in to help me with a new car as nobody was available from new cars as we did not have an appointment. Laurenzo was SUPER. We had the best test drive we've every had and he really looked after us very well. Ian (from 2nd hand cars) also stepped in to help out as Laurenzo was fairly new and between Ian and Laurenzo, they sold me a new car.
However, I was then handed over to Luca who had to step in at last minute and make some unexpected changes. The car I bought was not available and I had to settle for a slightly different car, but I was happy to do so as Mini carried the slight cost difference. The Finance Department, however, gave Luca and myself plenty of frustration and grey hairs. The back and forth for all the various documents after I was initially told they were not needed was a nightmare. It took an extra week to get paperwork sorted and although Luca was great in the way he handled things, the finance department made me quite angry.
However, Luca handled it all with much grace and efficiency and put up with my tantrums and it all worked out very well in the end.

Thank you to Laurenzo for selling me the car & Ian for the extra help with paperwork and then of course to Luca for making it all happen.

I am extremely happy with my new Mini Cooper and would recommend these guys to you at any time."
3/20/18,5,EVERYTHING DONE AND ON TIME.
3/19/18,5,Ryan was really helpfully and found a car that matched my requirements very quickly. Overall service was fantastic and they were able to meet all my required needs within a quick timescale. Really happy with my new car and i'm sure I will be back again in a couple of years for another one.
3/19/18,5,Was really pleased with the service I got from Inchcape. Jodie especially went out of her way to help sort it all out for us and we're really happy. A big thank you to her.
3/19/18,5,They were excellent
3/19/18,5,"Staff very helpful,polite and efficient. Good quick service."
3/19/18,5,Excellent customer service and all work completed to schedule
3/19/18,5,"Cooper Tonbridge gave excellent customer service
Would recommend them
Thank you again for your service"
3/19/18,5,"Everyone I met at Inchcape Norwich were extremely helpful.

Darren Williamson the sales executive I dealt with was very professional and informative."
3/19/18,1,"Unprofessional, unhelpful, slow and incompetent service all the way through from Inchcape Stockport - and apparently no point in complaining as they have never responded to my emails. I last dealt with them a month ago with a fault on a recently purchased used car, and I have now discovered that in addition to consistently poor customer service, their service dept are terrible too as the fault has reoccured (rest assured I will be taking the car elsewhere to be fixed this time.) I am now passing all of my unanswered complaints to Volkswagen UK, since they need to know how appalling their dealerships are."
3/19/18,5,"From the beginning Kim listened to what I was interested in and was able to find a car in Kent that gave me what I wanted, and more (sat nav.)!
Attention to detail was excellent.
Overall felt a valued customer.
A pleasant experience."
3/19/18,5,"The Service was excellent and I would recommend BMW Cooper in Sunderland to anyone. Michael Reed in sales was fantastic, really helpful and down to earth. No hard sale or pressure, just great customer service and a brilliant offer. The car is amazing and in future I would not go anywhere else."
3/19/18,5,Service was carried out with no problems fully kept informed as to what was going on and the benitit of a courtesy car very helpful all round a good day
3/19/18,5,A really smooth purchase from start to finish. Highly recommend & am loving my new car. Stacy Booth dealt with my purchase & was extremely efficient.
3/19/18,4,This is my 3rd car purchased through Peter now at Toyota. Bought brand new Rav4 Hybrid and its amazing. When I collected my car Inchcape made it so special by uncovering the car from the sheet covering it. Made it so exciting and special. Had follow up calls to check Im happy which is a nice touch. Only gave 4 stars due to the valeters not cleaning it as well as they should have as car had been standing in the showroom and several people had obviously sat in it. The mats had not been moved so bits all around the edges and few bits on back seat and boot. Its going to be cleaned again. The car is amazing and Toyota are looking after me so will be sorted. Would def recommend dealing with Inchcape Toyota
3/19/18,5,Couldn’t fault the service. Thank you
3/19/18,5,Very good service
3/19/18,5,"Enquired on Tuesday and drove away in our approved used car on Friday.
No hitches, very pleasant helpful staff, everything where it should be and done really well."
3/19/18,5,"Very courteous staff who kept the coffee coming! A few problems with my car service, but all explained and dealt with efficiently."
3/19/18,5,Excellent customer service. Josh was really helpful. A quick turnaround for an MOT and service which I found pleasing. The service department excelled in every way. Definitely recommend to all BMW owners.
3/19/18,5,"Very good service, Mathew Rees looked after my booking, he was very informative and professional."
3/19/18,5,"Excellent customer service - no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone. It’s getting so popular, they could really do with a bigger car park!!"
3/19/18,2,"Whilst the loan car was great, the actual service was poor. The car was returned later than requested, it didn’t get the complimentary clean and to top of off, on the way home, about 10 miles from BMW, the oil warning came on saying I was low on oil! Not good."
3/19/18,5,Quick booking in process. Loan car offered for the duration of the works. Timely and efficient with good customer service.
3/19/18,5,MOT and service done in promised time. Nice cup of coffee served on arrival. Free WiFi to pass the time.Surrounded by some fabulous BMW cars. My model trouble free from 2013 to date and covered by service plan..
3/19/18,5,Car was returned within the time scale given. Washed and all the staff were attentive
3/19/18,5,"Excellent service as always. The staff are all very helpful and professional,and lovely people too."
3/19/18,4,"We had a horrid experience with Ipswich BMW. Our friends said go to colchester but we did not listen. Bought a car and they turned up with the wrong one! In the end we bought a different one from colchester and although there were many faults with the car the Colchester team are 100x better to deal with than Ipswich so really if we were reviewing Ipswich it would be 1 star but colchester 5 stars. If only the car was as good as the service, sadly we had some faults and understand this can happen. Colchester management staff have been great and we have come to a solution that suits everyone thank you."
3/19/18,5,Very proffesional & helpful staff especially the employee who talked me through everything! I was so impressed with how proffesional & quick my sevice was! Wouldn’t definitely wait again for my sevice as the sitting/drinks area was very comfortable ! The best service ive ever had in my 8/9 years of driving with having a car serviced
3/19/18,5,Great service
3/19/18,5,"From initial contact to collection of the vehicle including part ex negotiations, Rhys dealt with everything in a thoroughly professional and efficient manner. I cannot think of any way in which my experience could have been improved. Well, maybe chocolate cake with the coffee!!!!!"
3/19/18,4,Member of the service team excellent
3/19/18,5,"On time, no fuss!"
3/19/18,5,Excellent service - and door to door assistance.
3/19/18,4,Good prompt service. Courteous and helpful.
3/19/18,5,"What a great experience from start to finish. I would like thank Gary (sales), Dean (sales manager) and Pete (service manager) for an A* professional and friendly attitude towards customer service. This is my fist time attending the Hyde Used Audi Centre and was totally impressed with how robust the team really are. I can honestly say that I am totally satisfied with my Audi A3 Convertible S3 and I would recommend anyone who is looking for a quality used Audi vehicle to check this place out first. Exceptional service!"
3/19/18,5,Restored my faith in main dealers - excellent service from start to finish. Excellent work very happy customer - Thankyou!!
3/19/18,5,"Superb customer service. Courtesy car arranged. Update calls when required and a beautifully clean (as well as serviced) car at the end of the day.
Thank you to Sue and Alice. Both excellent throughout."
3/19/18,5,Russell was exceptional to deal with and genuinely cared about finding me the perfect car - can not recommend him highly enough!
3/19/18,5,"I had been to a few Mini garages over the past few weeks looking at deals and this by far was the best experience i have had.
So helpful, from the conversation over the phone on Friday afternoon, to the test drive on Saturday morning.
Becky was a great help, no pressure just telling me what i needed to know, and putting up with me for a week, making the experience fun and easy. Plus from test drive to drive home was a week which was brilliant.

The car is excellent everything i wanted at the perfect price.
Definitely would recommend as it was the best experience i have had buying a car and the easiest."
3/19/18,5,I was made to feel welcome as soon as I went in. My representative Jonathan was so helpful and I am thrilled with my new Audi A1 he configured for me.
3/19/18,2,"My HiLux went in to Inchcape Toyota for a safety recall which was highlighted on 07 February 2017. The vehicle had been booked in to have the work done on 3 separate occasions and been cancelled 24 hours before. I am aware that this was a world wide recall, but Inchcape should not mess customers about by booking in vehicles, to have essential work done, without having the necessary parts available.
Also, when challenged about their actions, they lied by saying that I had booked via a central booking service. On at least 2 of the occasions I know I had spoken direct with Inchcape.
From my experience, customer service is not high on Inchcapes priority list."
3/19/18,5,I was very impressed with your services
3/19/18,4,"MOT performed on TT, no problems. Only minor gripe, MOT time was 1.40, keys were handed over at 1.30. Car was return at 3.10, and that was without the complementary wash and vac which I declined"
3/19/18,5,Just had my Toyota Auris serviced and everyone at Inchcape Toyota Nottingham were fanastic. My car was picked up from home in morning and returned fully serviced and washed later in the afternoon. Couldn't fault them. Well done all the servicing department.
3/19/18,5,"Good prompt service loved the video
Nice coffee while waiting"
3/19/18,5,"Hi there I want to thank Daniel and the team at Audi cheshire oaks in helping me change cars and my choice or car, there level of service was excellent and knowledge was excellent and which nothing but respect from them and kind people again I would like to thank cheshire oaks Audi and I’ll be back soon for the rs6,

Kind regards

Karl nolan"
3/19/18,5,"I was well looked after they did a good deal on a Q5 I would recommend them
Eddie was very helpful"
3/19/18,5,"The staff are very pleasant and helpful, and although, happily, there were no problems found with the car service, I thought the posted video a useful touch."
3/19/18,5,"Very impressed with the service. As soon as we entered the showroom we were greeted by the receptionist at the door asking how she could help. Then she took us to the service desk and introduced us to the service receptionist who had all our details ready.
Such a difference to past experiences with other garages when booking in our BMW or Audi where you were treated in a most subservient way.
So many congrats to the team at Inchcape Telford"
3/19/18,5,Excellent service - staff are polite and able to answer any questions. First class company to deal with. I would not hesitate to recommend.
3/19/18,5,"Professional, efficient and were more than accommodating in terms of giving me a lift to/from the dealership while my car was serviced. All serviced for free under the service plan and the car came back sparkling clean...."
3/19/18,4,"Generally good

We had an excellent experience when looking at and purchasing our car because of the extremely helpful and friendly sales assistant. Shopping for a new car isn't something we were looking forward to doing at all, but he made it a completely painless and largely enjoyable experience. He also put himself out and was very generous in mitigating the issues we faced afterwards when simple things were not checked, work agreed to not done and our service contract completely screwed-up; all of which cost us quite a bit of time and effort. All-in-all, we feel as if they caught the ball brilliantly and then fumbled it."
3/19/18,5,"A very pleasureable experience - Excellent Sales Staff, no hard selling and made to feel at home. The way it should be - by the way the car is also top notch."
3/19/18,5,"Absolutely fantastic service from Gavin & the team at Coopers in Colchester. The whole process was smooth, and everyone involved very professional. So happy with my car and made to feel that no question is too small, great service and will definitely be back when I purchase my next one!"
3/19/18,3,"My car was subject to a recall so I took it to Cheshire Oaks Mercedes. I'm afraid I could only rate my experience as 3 star due to several issues:
I arrived early, as advised, but I wasn't attended to until some minutes after my allotted appointment time.
I was advised the inspection would take no more than an hour, however it took nearly one and half hours.
Following the inspection I was told my car had a successful health check, however there was no mention of the subject of the recall and I wasn't given any documentation to say it was OK.
When my car was returned to me the drivers seat was in a different position and radio station was altered.
These issues are minor but cumulative and nonetheless important to me."
3/19/18,5,"Excellent , Regarding keeping me informed and the cost being clearly broken down along with the service being completed within the time frame given ."
3/19/18,5,Genuinely delighted with the service and professionalism from the Tunbridge Wells branch and Michael in particular.
3/19/18,5,Had great service from Chantal. She was very straightforward and helpful - a pleasure to deal with. Delighted with our new mini.
3/19/18,5,"Had my Mini serviced at Cooper Chelmsford on Saturday 17/3/18. Staff were very helpful and everything was quick, all paperwork available and waiting when I arrived. Waiting area comfortable, hot drinks available. Would recommend"
3/19/18,5,Good customer service and answered all questions when required and provided a number of options available.
3/19/18,5,"As always a great experience, friendly, professional staff. Car didn't actually need a service in the end but still got it back gleaming and spotless. Big thanks to Ronnie for the lift to the tram too!"
3/19/18,5,"I recently purchased a used car at this dealership.The whole experience was so straight forward,and direct that it inspired total trust from the start. This was important to me because the deal was conducted at a distance, by phone and mostly by email.
A great deal of the credit for my satisfaction goes to the Sales person I was dealing with, Ms Sara Perry, whose attention to detail, efficiency and patience was much appreciated, and not always the case in today's world..If my experience with Ms Perry is indicative of the ethos and culture of the company, their business practice standards are of a very high order indeed. Would certainly do business again"
3/19/18,5,Always provides excellent friendly service.
3/19/18,5,"Superb experience with East Kent Audi. Friendly staff, reasonable service costs, and non-pushy sales people. Walked in to service my A6, and walked out owning a brand new Q5 but never felt pressured into doing so!
Samantha Riggott is a real credit to your sales team. Friendly, bubbly and human! Down to earth lady who never tried to pressure me into a sale, but knew the answers to everything I asked."
3/19/18,5,"I purchased a car last week with Michael Taylor at Maidstone Audi. He was very professional, helpful and friendly which made the experience very pleasant. After dealing with a few other dealerships I would definitely recommend Audi and Michael to anyone"
3/19/18,4,"Easy enough to book the car in although initial phone call the person who answered was clearly in a rush and a bit rude but on the day receptionist was friendly & helpful.
The work was carried out without any further complications but will have to go back for warranty work due to parts not in stock."
3/19/18,5,Excellent service
3/18/18,5,Excellent customer service. Staff couldn’t be more helpful.
3/18/18,5,"The one thing that stood out through the process for me was great product knowledge.it was not just about selling you a car,for me it was getting a deal that was right for what I needed and the brilliant sale executive who saw the process through from the moment I first stepped in to Cooper Durham to the time I was Handed the keys of my new car and drove away.Thank you."
3/18/18,3,"Both times that my car has been in for service and more recently for just an oil change, I have had to readjust mirrors, seat positions, lights and even the air vents that had all been changed from my preferred settings/positions."
3/18/18,2,Wasn't contacted to confirm collection the day before and had to chase myself. Wasn't contacted with an update on the works by the service team. On being returned my car keys were not handed to me instead they were left on a desk and the car smelt heavily of aftershave.
3/18/18,5,"Service beyond compare.
From start to finish the experience was first class. I voiced that I needed my car to be sorted as soon as possible due to my work demands and the staff did everything they could to achieve this for me; in fact, my car was repaired before the diagnostics date I was given.
Communication was exemplary I knew what was happening every step of the way.
The service I was given was tantamount to 'your wish is our command'. The team are a true asset to your company."
3/18/18,5,Very efficient and helpful.
3/18/18,5,"From our first enquiry to picking our new car up we have had a very good experience. we collected our Discovery sport from Inchcape (Hunters) Preston, without any issues at all."
3/18/18,5,"Great service, friendly staff, affordable prices!"
3/18/18,4,We had a MOT and minor service completed on our VW Polo. It was a very professional service with no issues. We didn't receive a video of the work completed on our car though.
3/18/18,5,"Jon Taylor, in my opinion was a good sales executive that I would not have any reservations on recommending him & Coopers to family & friends."
3/18/18,5,"Great Customer service, Inchcape in my expereince do not oversell , prompt and efficient.
Had Mot and Annual minor service."
3/18/18,5,Excellent service and hospitality
3/17/18,2,"When I left the garage,there was smoke coming from my car at the back.i stopped twice n third time I had to go to someone house to asked for some water to put in my car
.was a bit disappointed the fact yr garageknewI didn't hve water in the car.when they did my engine.i did eventuallymanaged to drive home afterward."
3/17/18,2,"I purchased a used Jaguar XE from HA Fox Derby on Saturday 16 March 2018, and I can only voice concerns. Initially the salesman Jorge Eley was very professional and attentive, so I was delighted to place an order. On collection day no handover was undertaken and I asked about the auto wipers as they did not appear to be working correctly and he could not answer this simple question, I managed to resolve it. So basically no vehicle functions were described. When I arrived home I noticed chips and a scratch to the paintwork, which will obviously mean a separate 30 mile journey, so much for the Jaguar 165 multipoint check, what value is it? No undercover handover area is available, so if it is raining be prepared to get wet. This is the third Jaguar I have bought and I can safely say this is the worst dealership. Signing papers no problem, preparing and handing over a car big problem. A further point on collection day 3 hours before collection time, I called to speak to Jorge and was informed he was away from his desk so they would ask him to call me. This call wasn't received and when I challenged Jorge he stated he was not told of my call. I look forward to your reply. Ian Sxxxxr"
3/17/18,5,"My car was called in under a minor recall. I booked in & had to cancel due to bad weather. The booking process both times was very easy & the customer service staff were great working around my schedule. On the day again the staff were great, they all couldn’t have been more helpful. I was talked through what would happen & asked if I wanted to be present during the works. I declined as I knew it was in great hands & I opted to stay in the warm waiting area. I was told it would be upto an hour, it was only 40 mins. I was talked through the works carried out & informed my breaks & tyres had been checked for my safety & all were fine & raised no issues for concern. I then asked the gentleman who dealt with me, (I think he said his name was Neil, I feel awful I can’t completely remember his name) how I update my Navi in my car. He then offered to come have a look at the system I had in my car. After he looked at it he talked me through what I needed to do writing down the website I needed to go on. Overall a great experience & seeing all those beautiful new shiny cars in the show room made me want a new GLA. Since first driving Mercedes 3 years ago, I swore I’d never drive another make again & I still feel that way today. Thanks Mercedes."
3/17/18,1,"Worst experience ever !! After much delayed delivery, the day before the delivery was eventually scheduled we get a call saying the price has increased due to the fact that the car was fitted with ""non-standard"" wheels. This was despite the fact that these were the wheels on the car when we viewed and ordered it. At best this is incompetence ... at worst crooked. Needless to say we cancelled the ordered. We won't be back!"
3/17/18,3,"I was sold a servicing plan which I later regretted doing. This was later compounded by an invoicing cock-up which obviously showed that the invoicing management at Toyota Inchcape Guildford was not geared up to present an invoice in a way which clearly showed the customer how the net sum to be paid was arrived at. This, together with the fact that the car was not picked up at the prearranged time did not make this experience a very happy one."
3/17/18,5,"Excellent experience from reminder call ,through booking,collection,advise on work to return"
3/17/18,5,Time given with full explanations
3/17/18,5,Easy to make service appointment at my convenience. Car was ready at the specified time.
3/17/18,5,"My whole experience at Mercedes Liverpool was truely amazing, I was kept up to date of when my new car would be ready, the service was professional but so friendly.
I would recommend you to go and see this world class service for yourself, you will not be disappointed."
3/17/18,3,"After going through the necessary documentation to hand over my car for it's service i collected my courtesy car for the day. It was the same as mine a GLA Automatic which was fine, I was at first little disappointed with the state of the outside of the car; it looked like it had been off roading.
The inside was much worse, mud all in the footwells, the inside of the lower door, not what i had expected.
I did address this and i was given a different car which was clean & a £25 discount.
My feedback is, it shouldn't have happened in the first place it's not what you expect from a premium car dealership especially when my personal car was handed over in a spotless condition."
3/17/18,3,"This was my first experience of using Mercedes Derby for servicing my car having bought it from them originally.

Unfortunately, I felt the booking experience was very poor for any garage never mind one which is a main dealer for a premier car brand. It was convenient for me to go into the dealership to book the first service rather than by phone or via the internet. However, although the staff on main reception were very attentive, they could not raise anyone in the service department when I visited. Consequently, I was asked to fill in a form with all my car and contact details and they would have someone from service call me to book my car in. This was around lunchtime on the day I visited the garage, but by mid-morning the following day I still hadn't received a call back so I phoned them. Main reception were very apologetic that I hadn't been called and they put me through to service straight away. Apparently, I ""was on the list of people to be called"" so quite when that was going to happen I don't know. The person I talked to complained that they only had one person doing the follow-ups, hence the delay. Anyway, the service was booked at a convenient day and time for me, but why the complex procedure and long delay? In the local VW and Peugeot dealerships that I also use, you can just walk up to the service desk at any time and you are all booked in a few minutes.

The service itself all went well. I was quickly checked in with a cup of good coffee and then attended to by an Aftersales Assistant, Robyn, who was particularly efficient. I went shopping while the car was being serviced and received a text to say the car was ready. On my return, all the paperwork for the service and health check were well explained and some additional work that I had asked for a quote on was all properly documented.

The condition of the car when I picked it up from the forecourt was disappointing. It was supposed to have been washed, but there were clearly areas of the bodywork that had not been cleaned and there were plenty of wipe marks left on it. The interior looked ok.

Overall, I was pleased with the service itself and the way I had been treated in the showroom, but the booking experience and the car wash were well below what I would expect from Mercedes."
3/17/18,4,"Car serviced with no issues, therefore cannot comment on how the dealership will handle more intricate issues. Minor gripe is the car was returned cleaned superficially but it was evident that attention to detail was missing e.g. certain areas not dusted down, door trims not wiped etc"
3/17/18,5,"We always have a pleasant experience at Inchcape. Staff are very friendly, informative and respectful."
3/17/18,5,"Excellent customer experience, from the beginning to the end of the transaction. We dealt with Jad for our purchase and we found him to be very reliable in that everything he said he would do he did, he maintained contact as and when needed. A salesman that listens! At no time did we feel we were a ""pain"" or inconvenience.
The same was true when we drove over 200 miles to collect the car, every single person on the showroom floor who made eye contact smiled and said hello. Particular thanks to Maisie for clearing the coffee spillage without exasperation! People buy from people not pushy sales people! Thank you!"
3/17/18,1,"Traded in my car at Chelmsford and bought VW CC. I'm owed over £1300 for the exchange but have been waiting for over 3 weeks already. They never return calls or messages and have been avoiding the issue. Considering I buy a new car every year, I wil not be returning or recommending them to anyone."
3/17/18,2,"submitted my car overnight - still had to wait over 30 mins to collect at the end of the following day plus car wasn't even valeted - really poor execution considering i had paid over 400 pounds for the bill -
on a plus note they did offer me a complimentary valet at my convenience."
3/16/18,5,Excellent service from Sam Cheesman. Lovely showroom with expert advice.
3/16/18,5,From the time I first entered Cooper Mini to the last time I left I was looked after with first class efficiency. Could not of asked for a better service.
3/16/18,5,"Bought a new Golf from Colchester Inchcape and couldn't fault the service at all, if anything we were absolutely blown away by the sheer professionalism and attention to detail throughout the entire process.
We previously started trying to buy a card from a Ford garage in Essex and experienced continual issues with every aspect of purchasing. Went to Colchester (Axial Way) and spoke to Alex Harris who made the entire experience a complete pleasure and truly exciting and stress free - start to finish. Recommending that team (every person we met/had dealings with was superb) to anyone that'll listen. Cannot believe how much care and thought went into everything and it's made what was an awful endeavour elsewhere into an unforgettable one for all the right reasons."
3/16/18,5,Thomas Jury dealt with the purchase of my Q5. He was excellent through out. He kept in mind my personal requirements and exceeded expectation. He offered flexibility where necessary and a pleasure to do business with. I will return when in the market for my next car
3/16/18,5,A very good seemless experience.
3/16/18,5,Excellent customer service from David Johnson and the team. Thankyou
3/16/18,5,"Cannot say enough about these chaps . Just the best car buying experience I have ever had . No messing all very honest and really pleased with the car

A massive thankyou to Ryan and gareth"
3/16/18,5,I can recommend inchcape Kings Lynn. At no time did we feel pressured to buy and Simon Medlock was particularly helpful and knowledgeable. I met him a short while ago when my father bought a car there so when we decided to look Simon was our first contact. We did purchase a car and between Simon and Richard we couldn’t be happier with the service. Thank you.
3/16/18,5,"Friendly, efficient and on time excellent service, would recommend them to anyone"
3/16/18,5,Excellent customer service. Highly recommend.
3/16/18,5,"Excellent service, great feedback, good people"
3/16/18,5,"All positive, friendly and efficient"
3/16/18,5,Linsey greeted me warmly and said the service would take approximately one to one and a half hours and as I was going into town she would phone when it was ready. Everything was fine with my car and she sent me a video of the service.
3/16/18,4,Friendly staff who were able to accommodate my earlier appointment start time for my repair. Free wash and vac as well. Great service all round.
3/16/18,5,Easy to deal with.professional and competitive.
3/16/18,5,My mini was in for a service and I was very happy with my experience there.
3/16/18,5,Communication was bang on the money at every juncture!! Seems apparent across the brand as a whole which is refreshing across sales and service teams. I have felt tempted to move to a different brand of vehicle in 12 months but the service levels here are going to tip the balance to stick with. Good work!
3/16/18,5,"Best team, really thanks"
3/16/18,2,"Ask the dealer to check the wheel corrosion - this wasn't completed and the excuse was they check the wrong wheel.

The solution was - can you arrange to bring the car back in at our convenience - only during the week please during working hours.

Altogether poor service - customer a distant second from the priority 'warranty manager'"
3/16/18,5,"Mini Cooper York - Fantastic service as usual, from sales to service I can not fault this garage. Reluctant to go anywhere else so this will be our third purchase."
3/16/18,5,"Difficult to fault. Lent me a courtesy car, did service in time, rang me when ready. Engineer found a couple of serious issues requiring immediate attention and sent a video report of the affected items in the underside of my car direct to my mobile phone. They fixed the items (broken spring and damaged ball joint) same day. I’ve used Mercedes Leicester and they don’t know which way is up. Coventry Mercedes are brilliant."
3/16/18,5,Quick and helpful service staff!
3/16/18,3,Salesperson was making promises knowing that they could not be met. The 3 stars however are given because on the day of collection we had a young female salesperson complete the deal who made the experience what it should have been from the start. There should be more emphasis in comunication before and after the deal.
3/15/18,5,The service check was quick and efficient.
3/15/18,5,Very good service..
3/15/18,5,"We would strongly recommend Toyota Burton. Their customer service and attention to detail was amazing. We purchased our car through Garry Adams who kept us up to date on the cars arrival, exchanges dates and had everything organised. His customer service was brilliant.
We had contact with the wider team who all were helpful and clearly had the needs of customer at heart."
3/15/18,2,"It took in excess of 30 minutes to check the car in , not good when you are in a hurry in the morning.
When it came to establishing if the car was ready for collection the next day, the switchboard could not connect me to the person allocated to look after my car but after being redirected to the switchboard (on a loop I assume) she established that the car was ready. Upon arriving the service receptionist did process my papers and payment quickly - best part of my experience!
She then requested for the car to be brought round for me but half an hour later it still had not arrived. I was not told what the problem was until I returned to reception and then was advised that a recovery vehicle was blocking getting the serviced vehicles out but it should not be too long.
Eventually I saw the car parked outside the main entrance and I had to again approach reception and eventually received the key.
In short my experience fell well short of what I would expect from BMW and trust that this experience will not be repeated."
3/15/18,1,"The people are nice, attentive and polite.
My car was in the get the keys recoded...... this wasn’t done, because some mismatch with the ECU but they still took my money (£66) to do nothing.
Aha but they did..... they cleaned the car somewhat, then put it on the lift to inspect the underside, stearing, brake pads, leaks and non key/coding issues.
I didn’t ask for this but done this anyway, this is why I was charged!

I was told I could pay a further £300+ for a long overdue service and more for items that need replacing, also a further £140+ to investigate (NOT FIX) the ECU/keys mismatch, with still no guarantee that they could get it sorted.....
NOT HAPPY AT ALL."
3/15/18,5,"Great service, friendly welcome. I would highly recomends Mercedes Derby"
3/15/18,5,Incredible customer care from all staff at coopers Chelmsford. Especially Livvy and another girl in service desks nothing too much trouble. Lots time given to us to go over what had been done during service and answered all our questions. We did not feel rushed and at same time did not feel we had been waiting long time. Valeting exceptional car was showroom condition when we collected it. James Omari
3/15/18,5,Thoroughly professional car service. Customer is kept fully informed at each stage of the process. Would recommend unreservedly.
3/15/18,5,"Great customer service from the initial phone call to arrange my service; with very limited availability on my part, through to me driving away in a car that felt brand new again!

Thank you Jonnie at Tetbury Audi and everyone else involved!

There is a reason I keep coming back to you....."
3/15/18,5,"Took my Polo in for a service. Very satisfied with all aspects. Everything was explained very well and the experience made me feel like a valued
customer. Well done VW"
3/15/18,5,"Always excellent,have used Maidstone Audi for many years.Ben Lemprere my service chap very efficient nice one Ben"
3/15/18,5,Excellent service. Friendly and professional staff. Beautiful courtesy car provided. Will use them again. Thank you.
3/15/18,5,"I visited mini Tonbridge as my daughter needed new brake pads and discs. We phoned on a Thursday and they were able to do the job straight away so that she could travel home to Manchester.
While at the garage I looked at a countryman and was keen to get one at some point.
Later in the week I went back and had a long conversation with the salesman Daryl Bull who was very clear and honest in his opinion of the car. I bought one the very next week.
Daryl did not ebpver use the hard sell and spent in all at least 7 hours with us to ensure we got what we wanted.
I have rated the garage five stars because of the way we were treated at the garage ."
3/15/18,5,Great customer service. Prompt and polite. Discussed the work carried out and told me all good and when next service due.
3/15/18,5,"I had planned to book it in for a routine service, but when I rang I was advised to check my car's 'flexible' service details on its system to check whether it was necessary.. I did this, and found that I don't need one for another 12K miles, which is quite a worthwhile saving. I carried on with the booking for other items that are time-dependent - MOT, brake fluid Haldex oil, aircon service, etc.

All was as it should be - I arrived on time, the car was taken in on time, I was treated politely and given an accurate estimate of the time required. I chose to while-you-wait, and the waiting area was adequately comfortable."

Recommended, efficient service."
3/15/18,5,"The Service team in Guildford are such a pleasure to work with and after 12 years of various sizes of Toyota, they are always trustworthy. I love the video that is sent highlighting items that need attention under the car either immediately or in the future. I thoroughly recommend this team."
3/15/18,5,"A great bunch of people, polite, helpful and very friendly, it was a pleasure to visit their site."
3/15/18,5,Excellent service from Chris Gomes very efficient and professional
3/15/18,5,The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful and I am extremely pleased with Inchcape and would advise anybody to use your service.
3/15/18,5,"Emails explaining what vw were doing
Guy collected the car and dropped off
Video of going through my car gave me reassurance that we were not getting ripped off
The lady who rang to take payment answered all my questions and was very polite
Excellent service thank you!"

3/15/18,5,"Efficient check in. Clear advice. Completed on time.
We did say we didn't need a courtesy car but one was arranged anyway but didn't affect us."
3/15/18,5,Superb experience at Cooper Durham. I will always use this Dealership. Lovely staff and has a family friendly feel.
3/15/18,4,"Efficient and kept me updated.

The parking was an issue both on dropping off and picking up but I understand the Coventry dealership are moving to larger premises, so this shouldn't be an issue next year"
3/15/18,5,Christine was very helpful
3/15/18,5,"From the moment I walked into the reception at Inchcape Stratford-on-Avon, there was an immediate atmosphere of welcome, efficiency, customer care and an all-round feeling of satisfaction. Nothing was too much trouble, every member of the team I met, actually listened to what I had to say and responded accordingly. It's so rare to experience customer satisfaction to that degree and I don't think I've experienced anything like that at that level - ever before. When I walked out of the reception, I just felt that I had been taken care of in the most professional manner. Well done everyone, you get my vote without question!"
3/15/18,5,"Dealing with Cooper Reading for my purchase was easy and stress free. Everything ran smoothly except snow slowing things down. Abby was my sales executive and she was a pleasure to deal with. I feel i got the best deal possible which is always a lovely feeling.

Abby was patient with me due to me not knowing 100% what i wanted and my indecisiveness when deciding to do a deal.

I will definitely use Cooper Reading again but not for a while as I want to enjoy my new car for a while first!"
3/15/18,5,"Excellent service, got video shows all check, can see all job they done"
3/15/18,5,"Great service, good communication and guaranteed service/parts.

Excellent service"
3/15/18,5,"Excellent customer service and over all a fantastic experience. Grant is a gentleman who answered all of my questions , fantastic sales man ! Definitely would come back and buy a car again.
Janet lees"
3/15/18,5,"I took car in for a quick check on tyres etc. and the staff were,as always, helpful and efficient."
3/15/18,5,"Excellent service, a good price and all quickly and smoothly delivered."
3/15/18,4,"Car booked in for warranty repair to drivers seat. During free visual health check screw/nail found in rear tyre. I had tyre insurance (fortunately!) and was able to progress claim with assistance from Coopers and although final approval from insurers came quite late, Coopers managed to replace tyre and car was ready at agreed collection time 👍
Friendly service staff."
3/15/18,5,Every aspect of the service experience exceeded my expectation. I was met in reception immediately on arrival and everything was explained about the service. I was given a lift to my destination within minutes. I received messages to my phone and email account detailing the work done on completion with a video explaining the inspection carried out. I think VW are setting the stardard for servicing.
3/15/18,5,Tried hard to ensure the experience was efficient and positive despite the cost.
3/15/18,5,"Annual service organized to suit my schedule.
Received a pleasant welcome. Told what was to happen in the service schedule. Comfortable lounge area while waiting. Car returned 'spotless'.
(Surprised that an oil change was carried out after only 6,700 miles but it shows the quality of the service). Video of checks carried out sent via email along with a text confirming car service completed. Could not ask for better service from the helpful, pleasant, and friendly staff at the Derby Sales and Service Center."
3/14/18,1,"Staff unhelpful/lack knowledge of vehicle updates and work undertaken on the vehicle to rectify reported faults. Expect to wait over a week for an appointment even if your vehicle is showing a red error message, or over a month for an appointment if you need a courtesy car. Service department dont return calls. The vehicle health check reported no issues even though it was obvious new tyres were needed. I questioned this, requested a price for new tyres and was advised I’d receive a call the next morning which was never received. Another frustratingly disappointing experience with Land Rover at Brock."
3/14/18,5,Thank you very much for your kind interest and being on time
3/14/18,5,"Good service, helpful salesperson Thomas, would recommend you use this audi dealer."
3/14/18,5,Excellent service and great facilities to work in whilst waiting. WiFi could be a bit better though.
3/14/18,5,Efficient and friendly staff.
3/14/18,4,"Very good service,car was cleaned, only thing I was disappointed with was that somebody must have taken it for a test drive as it only had 9 miles on the fuel warning on dashboard,it had 30 odd when I dropped it off"
3/14/18,5,Excellent service from all the staff at VW Inchcape Chelmsford with particular praise to Amanda who looked after me so well. Am always surprised how such a large dealership manages to provide such one to one personal service but it does and very well too. Would highly recommend dealership to others for both new car purchase and after sales.
3/14/18,5,"All the staff were extremely polite, friendly and helpful
The work on the car was carried out to my satisfaction, very pleased"
3/14/18,4,"Very pleased with my second hand Mercedes CLA class, good service from Liverpool Garage, Paul was very helpful."
3/14/18,5,"Good service and attention given to us when buying our car.

Very happy with the service"
3/14/18,2,"I paid the deposit and was told I would be contact about the delivery date which would likely be at the end of the year ie Dec 2017.

After hearing nothing after 3 months I contacted the dealership and left 5 voice mail messages as no one was available to speak to me, over a 5 day period. Not one of those messages was returned. Ultimately I spoke to a person in the vehicle servicing department and explained the situation lucky for me that person kindly contacted a manager in the Sales department on my behalf. Apparently the order was overlooked!

I waited 6 months from putting down a deposit to receiving the car. Not a good experience at all."
3/14/18,5,The Customer Service at the Shrewsbury Site was excellent. The person who dealt with me has excellent people skills. Everything was exlained in full detail and questions were answered promptly. I would defintely recommend Inchcape Shrewsbury to anyone.
3/14/18,5,Very helpful and informative always will recommend Audi Maidstone when looked after by Matthew.
3/14/18,1,"Car was in for service. When I picked it up I was told that the car needed to be booked in for front brake pad change. When reviewing the onboard computer in the morning it indicated that there was 16,000 mile before front brake pad change and 8,000 before rear pad change. Inchcape made no mention of rear pads, but stated front must be booked in immediately. I declined the opportunity on basis of computer and checked when I went to car. It stated 16,000 for front and 8,000 for rear.

Are Inchcape trust worthy?"
3/14/18,5,Colin was excellent as always in his support and customer service.
3/14/18,5,Excellent customer service from Dean and the rest of the team .
3/14/18,5,"Once again, Inchcape Toyota handled my annual service with the greatest of care and attention. Josh completed the tasks and even sent a video of the general health check prior to me receiving back the vehicle. Absolutely no reservations, 5 stars and would have given 10 if available."
3/14/18,5,Very helpful and quick
3/14/18,5,excellent service.
3/14/18,5,Samantha was extremely helpful an welcoming.
3/14/18,5,"Excellent service throughout... Very approachable, knowledgeable, friendly staff, especially Ashley Etchells who dealt with us, nothing was too much trouble for him and he even stayed late on 2 occasions to accommodate us, which was brilliant. what a lovely man he is. I would certainly recommend the Warrington branch and Mercedes to anyone. On handover we were made to feel like Royalty... thank you"
3/14/18,5,First class service everything explained what was done
3/14/18,5,I took my polo in for a service every thing was very easy. I made enquiries about the new golf came away with a lot of information. thanks to everyone who helped.
3/14/18,5,"Vehicle was booked in for service, have to say from start to finish the whole experience was exemplary, friendly, polite excellent service was kept up to date was was happening as I had to stay at the showroom as travelled to far, plenty of beverages & literature to choose from whilst waiting. Thank you."
3/14/18,3,"Sent my car in for service and MOT, gentleman who served me was very polite and professional. Collected my car and was very disappointed to find it had not been washed (as I was advised it would be) and it was dirtier inside than when I dropped it off - grass and leaves on floor on passenger side. Not impressed!"
3/14/18,5,As ever really impressed with the customer service @ Maidstone Audi and in particular the care and attention provided by Ben Lempriere.
3/14/18,5,"I cannot fault the way in which Andy (at Inchcape Landrover in Norwich) dealt with me and the minor repair my Freelander needed.
Nothing was too much trouble! SImply a first class service from start to finish."
3/14/18,5,"Very efficient and speedy service in a very pleasant environment. Staff are very friendly.
Overall a good experience..very happy"
3/14/18,5,Helpful & trustworthy. Couldn't ask for more.
3/14/18,5,"Excellent service, home collection and delivery made the service stress free. The video of the health check is a really nice touch."
3/14/18,5,Brilliant customer service during my purchase of a new 320d. Bmw always went out of their way to try and ensure that I was made to feel a valued customer. This is my second vehicle purchased from this dealership and I would not hesitate returning for another one. Great sales team.
3/14/18,5,Very good service everything fine
3/14/18,5,Good service
3/14/18,5,Very pleased with service at Cooper Cobham as always. Darnell was great as my service coordinator.
3/14/18,5,I would highly recommend H A Fox of Derby. The staff are friendly and knowledgable. I was left with a feeling I had been helped to buy a car not sold one.
3/14/18,4,Straightforward service experience. Recommended
3/14/18,3,"Minimum effort made to book an MOT re-test after a failure. I was getting the work done by a third party and wanted to arrange a re-test before going abroad on holiday (during which time the MOT expired). I was told ""they only take 5 minutes"" but I was unable to book an appointment (I had to call beforehand and hope for the best), they don't do re-tests after 3.30pm on weekdays, and not at all on weekends. I guess it's their policy but it didn't feel as though they were going out of their way to make me happy."
3/14/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish. Collecting the car from our home and bringing it back following an annual service and MOT. Cleaned throughout. Well done!
3/14/18,4,"Booking in for an end of warranty check and MOT was easy to do. On arrival reception staff were very courteous and friendly. The handover of my vehicle and collection of a loan vehicle was quick and efficient. Timely notification of when my vehicle was ready for collection and again reception staff very welcoming. As part of the service a valet was carried out. Sadly this valet let down the whole experience as I had to go over the smudges and marks left on windows and some paint work and also the door sills had not been touched. I would certainly recommend having checks and servicing carried out but wouldn't expect too much from the valet, pity."
3/14/18,4,"Very prompt service , slightly disapointed they forgot to wash it but am assured it will be washed when it goes back in for some further work."
3/14/18,5,"First class service provided. very helpful staff, a real pleasure to have my car serviced.
Staff were fab."
3/14/18,4,"Buying a car is an enjoyable experience, but also a longwinded process, particularly when you have two young children with you.
Sam Taylor looked after us, and made the process as swift as he could, and was very informative with his Mercedes knowledge. I don't like to heavy sales pushes, and Sam I am glad to say didn't push me for the order."
3/14/18,5,"I recently had my car serviced at Leicester Mercedes, I found the level of service very professional. The ""Health Check"" carried out on my vehicle while being serviced was a new experience for me as the Service Manager sent me an e-mail with a video attachment made by the engineer working on my car. This showed me the worn suspension strut in real time & helped high light any other issues, the strut was replaced while in for service, I was impressed with the technology now being used to confirm problems with vehicles & help in the repair."
3/14/18,5,"I found the experience of buying my new car from Maidstone Audi completely stress free. The salesman actually listened to what I wanted and didn't try to pressure me into buying things I did not want, which was most refreshing."
3/14/18,5,"I can unequivocally profess to have had the perfect experience at Mini Sunderland. From the initial phone call expressing my interest in a car I had seen online, to viewing the car, the entire transaction took less than 48 hours to complete. The person I dealt with was warm, friendly and exhibited none of the cheesy falseness you usually find in staff in car sales. I would highly recommend the service I received."
3/14/18,5,"Very friendly and helpful; sorted out an urgent problem for me on the same day, without a prior booking.

Also offer a service plan which my normal dealer no longer offers.

Although this dealer is not my nearest Jaguar agent, I shall probably switch to using them for future servicing etc."
3/14/18,2,"This is my first experience of owning a Mercedes car. I'm sure it's not the most expensive second hand car Mercedes of Nottingham have sold but at £20k it's a lot to me & the car is still under the manufacturer's warranty. Anyway perhaps it was a ""first thing Monday morning"" thing but the staff member who dealt with me came across as very dismissive, uninterested & didn't seem to understand what the issue was with the car. She couldn't even be bothered to quickly explain anything about the loan car I was being given. I came away very unsatisfied that the issues had been dealt with or properly explained to me If this was my very first after sales experience with a Mercedes main dealer after spending £20k im not impressed & not what I was expecting. Im now wondering if I made the right choice of dipping my toe in the world of Mercedes."
3/13/18,5,"I never thought I would enjoy an MOT day, but the team in Chelmsford and in particular James Gerrish put a smile on my face! They went out of their way and the extra mile to help! First class service!"
3/13/18,5,"I have recently purchased a new Mercedes GLA from the company, and was very happy with the overall service provided. The salesman who I dealt with, Phil Litchfield, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout, and very easy to talk to.
He explained everything regarding the deal clearly and in detail, something that I appreciated as there is a lot of paperwork to go through!
The vehicle that I wanted was not in stock locally, but was sourced for me from Exeter, and despite the bad weather arrived in Nottingham in good time.
The only significant problem in the whole process was a computer failure on the day I went to pick up the car, meaning that it wasn't possible for Nottingham Mercedes to tax it for me that day. Phil was very helpful, and loaned me his own car to go home in, so that I could return the following day to collect mine..... I consider that service over and above the call of duty, many thanks Phil!
This is the second time I've bought from the company, and would have no hesitation in doing so again."
3/13/18,5,I had an excellent experience buying my first Mini Cooper. They made sure everything was to my needs and requirements and made sure that I had a good deal too. Excellent customer service.
3/13/18,5,"Very easy to deal with, and they cleaned my car,"
3/13/18,1,"Unfortunately I have had a very negative experience when dealing with their General Enquiries Team. I recently gave my car to the Services for a fault with the Stop/Start system and upon receiving it, I noted there was a scratch on my passenger window 3 weeks ago. I have tried to contact the General enquiries since then via their emailing service (at least 4 times) but on each occasion I have only received an automated email saying that someone will get back to me in the next 2 hours, although I 'm STILL yet to hear anything further. Hugely frustrating.

I will certainly be looking elsewhere when it comes to getting another car."
3/13/18,5,"Good experience. Very impressed with the complimentary lift to and from my MOT, great feature!"
3/13/18,3,"Booked a service for 12/03/18. I was advised that this work would take 90 minutes and decided to wait. It was also mentioned that the usual courtesy wash would be carried out. I arrived slightly early for the 09.15 appointment and after a short wait was booked in. As it was raining, I agreed that the cleaning would be unnecessary. Sitting in the rather draughty waiting area, the expected one and a half hours came and went. After two and a quarter hours had passed and with no word about progress, I went to the desk and asked. The service was eventually done and Ms Bokenham worked very hard to complete all the paperwork and take payment asap. Then, searching the compound in the rain, my car was nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, a gentleman who I assume was a Cooper employee, took my key and kindly went off in search of the car whilst I went back inside out of the rain. The above is irritating rather than serious and to be fair, I have often had excellent service from this dealer. BMW is a very expensive brand and although I think it not unreasonable to expect back-up to match, the dealer's advertised claims in this respect are perhaps rather optimistic and could easily lead to unintended disappointment as happened in this case."
3/13/18,5,Took the E-Class back for some work under warranty. An excellent service in every respect.
3/13/18,5,Excellent service. Job well done and a good loan car too.
3/13/18,5,Prompt and efficient service and staff very accommodating. Waiting area had free drinks available which was really appreciated and made the wait more pleasant. Would definitely use this dealership again.
3/13/18,1,"Read a few negative online comments before booking car in and thought ahhh... it won't happen to me.

Went to get bumper fixed a year ago. Went to pick it up and half of it was hanging off. The guy rummaged around and clicked a plastic bit back on. Lack of attention to detail and massively concerning how fragile my new 5 series was.

Booked car in for service. Arrived and told they couldn't do it for free (I had a free service pack) because it wasn't quite 2 years old. I specifically asked this when booking in.

In the intermediate period they called me twice asking me if I wanted to book my car in for servicing. When I told them I already had they seemed confused and said they'd confirm and call me back. They didn't. So I called them, now concerned. It took two calls (they were going to investigate and call me back the first time) to verify they had indeed got my booking.

Arrived for second attempt. After waiting 15 minutes was seen to. After booking in was asked if I needed the loan car I had pre-booked as they were really short. They would get me a taxi. So I said OK and was then told I had a 30 minute wait for a taxi.

When taxi arrived the lady asked if I didn't mind sharing because we were going to same way. We weren't - we were going completely opposite directions.

I was called to say the car was ready to pick up. When I arrived I waited for 15 minutes before anyone saw me. Then the chap said he would go and get the car. 15 minutes later he came back and said it hadn't been cleaned and they were doing that. Another 15 minute wait.

I then arrive home to realise that they haven't re-set the key. It still says I need to have it serviced.

I now have doubts they did anything to my car! They won't return my calls.

REALLY disappointing. I might expect this from a second hand car dealer on Walford Square. A BMW garage in Surrey - come on guys do better. There are dozens of you walking around the showrooming looking important - but nobody is doing anything."
3/13/18,1,"Was treated like an idiot when explaining a problem and when collecting the car was asked to pay when I had already done so on a two service plan.Not only that it would have been £100 more than a very good garage I had gone to previously! coffee wasn't bad though.Oh,and I had a brand new rear tyre fitted a couple of months ago and they said the the wear was the same as the old one,make of that what you will."
3/13/18,1,"We bought a new VW Polo from Inchcape Chester. After 17,500 miles had major problems due to electronic fault. They refused to honour the warranty. Bought three other vw cars from Lookers Blackpool and never had a problem. Steer well clear of Inchcape."
3/13/18,5,"Great Job done again...lovely service ..great people,,"
3/13/18,5,"Excellent, friendly and helpful service."
3/13/18,5,Excellent service received
3/13/18,5,"Service department very good. Vehicle ready as promised, good wiring area with courtesy drinks. Exactly as one would expect from a BMW dealer!"
3/13/18,5,"Having just received my new Audi A6 I would like to thank the staff at Audi Stockport they have been friendly welcoming and helpful every time I have been in particular Jonathan brotherdale who was very helpful patient and very attentive he was always available to answer any questions I had
thank you all at Stockport Audi for making my experience of buying a new car very special"
3/13/18,1,"I am afraid that my dealings with Cooper BMW in Reading, in the capacity of potential customer, have been far from ideal. I have spent considerable time searching for a used BMW M3 Convertible to match my criteria, and in February came across a BMW M3 Series advertised by Cooper BMW Reading. Several telephone conversations followed, when I informed Cooper BMW Reading that I lived in North Wales, and that whilst I was very interested in the car, it would involve me in a 500 mile round trip. As such I would only consider travelling to view the vehicle if they could assure me that it was in first class condition. The BMW representative assured me that this was the case, and arranged to forward a video of the vehicle. In the video a scratch on the bonnet was pointed out, but I was advised that this would be polished out. I reiterated my concern that the bodywork be in first class condition as in view of the distance I had to travel I did not want to waste my time. Again it was stated that the bodywork was excellent.

I duly drove from North Wales to Reading, where the vehicle was parked in the showrooms. From a distance it looked all I had hoped. Unfortunately upon closer inspection this proved to be far from the case. I can only describe the paintwork - over the whole of the vehicle - to look akin to an ice rink! Indeed if someone had told me a 5 year old had cleaned the vehicle with a brillo pad I would not have been surprised. To say this was a disappointment was an understatement. Indeed the salesman was forced to agree that “it could have been better”!

I avoided making a scene, but after leaving cannot help feeling that Cooper BMW Reading had taken me for an idiot. They knew how far I had to travel and I can only assume that they thought perhaps it wouldn’t be noticed! As the car was in excess of £23,000 it wasn’t a cheap run of the mill vehicle, and in my opinion the phrase “blind man on a galloping horse” would be the only person willing to pay that price for the vehicle.

I have since emailed both the Used Sales Director and the Financial Director - and have not had the courtesy of a reply. It even took 2 weeks to repay the £1000 deposit I had paid prior to the viewing.

I have since purchased an immaculate BMW M3 Convertible from Synter at High Wycombe and cannot praise them enough. They correctly described the car and were a pleasure to deal with.
Avoid Cooper BMW Reading. They obviously have low customer satisfaction priorities. I am not seeking compensation, merely an explanation and apology!"
3/13/18,1,Service light still on after taken my F type in for a service
3/13/18,5,Helpful and informative with no pressure
3/13/18,5,"Excellent service from Neil and the team at Cooper Mini, the rear brake pad warning activated on a Sunday afternoon in my driving tuition vehicle and it needed to be sorted ASAP, despite having a full diary of services they turned around the healthcare & replacement within 3hrs on Monday morning, meaning I was able to continue lessons in the afternoon, great stuff, thank you!"
3/13/18,5,"MOT carried out in the specified time and car was completed with a full valet, all staff very courteous, looking forward to my next visit."
3/13/18,5,Nice welcome car serviced and all issues dealt with. Very efficient and within the time slot allocated. Cost very reasonable.
3/13/18,5,"Nuala Cooper BMW Norwich - was my customer adviser, the customer service was 1st class, she was very informative and dealt with any questions or queries very quickly. Very pleased with the service I have received. Mr Thatcher"
3/13/18,4,Great car at a good price. Derek was very helpful and friendly throughout buying experience. Only slight fly in the ointment was there was supposed to be some touching in done on the car before I collected it but I had to go back to get this done. Only thing that stopped me give 5 stars.
3/13/18,4,Very good customer service
3/13/18,3,"I chose to wait with my car while it was serviced and was told it would be between 1 hour to 1.5 hours waiting. In total it took nearly 3 hours and I received no communication or apologies for the delay. If I had known it would take 3 hours I would not have chosen to wait with my car. My previous experience with Mercedes Service has been good, so I am not sure if they had just over booked or had staff not turn in, but either way some communication would have been appreciated."
3/13/18,4,"Requested a courtesy car for a service being carried out but none in stock. I was then promised to be pushed ahead of the queue if I came back with my work laptop.

I was then able to work - albeit slowly - and Bilal helped ensure I minimised my loss of earning.

All I would suggest is to ring / text ahead to ensure a courtesy car is available,m to avoid disappointment. Takes 2 minutes and would help reduce complaints.

Otherwise, good service from a branch I know well."
3/13/18,5,"really good service, all comments well explained, very corteous, no issues at all"
3/13/18,5,"First class experience all round. Nice greeting by main desk, followed by a very pleasant coffee and chat with friendly service staff member. No nasty surprises with the bill either :)"
3/13/18,5,Excellent service- good communication and customer care
3/13/18,2,Car was booked for 2hrs service but actually took 3hrs. In addition a valeting and car washing service was promised upon return of the car. Neither occurred. Very disappointed.
3/13/18,5,I would recommend this garage without hesitation.
3/13/18,5,Very helpful and friendly stuff
3/13/18,5,Superb service before during and after routine MOT ...all staff are really professional and extremely helpful and friendly
3/13/18,5,"From the warm welcome to the presentation of our new Range Rover Evoque the process was trouble free and a pleasure to experience.
We were helped in our choices of options for the car, all the options explained clearly. On the pick up day the process was trouble free.
Cannot say thank you enough for the attention to detail and the result of the perfect car for us."
3/13/18,4,"Service excellent from booking to completion of work.
I was kept informed during the day of any additional work required, plus a video was sent of inspection carried out.
When I returned in the evening car was ready for collection."
3/13/18,5,Good standard of service and the car so nice and clean after
3/13/18,5,"Lovely friendly staff great customer service
would recommend"
3/13/18,5,"My visit was for a MOT and service. I was greeted by three smiling faces of the ladies on reception who took the time to speak to me sincerely. The service assistant was friendly and professional and he explained what was going to done. I received a video of the health check that they carried out. The downside was that when the work had been completed I received a text and not a call, but I suppose that is technology these days. The bill was explained fully. Therefore I would recommend them"
3/13/18,5,Excellent service
3/13/18,2,"The service received at the Mercedes-Benz (Oxford) branch, leaves much to be desired. Compared to other dealerships, it's very much wait around for a long to be seen by the servicing department (even though you've got an appointment booked) and once you are seen, you are rushed out the door especially when you try and ask further questions about the car/service.

I purchased a brand new Mercedes-Benz C-Class last year has now been in the dealership twice with getting a number of issues fixed under the warranty, and with certain issues I've been treated like I've made them up out of the blue and they're not willing to resolve them. With a car this new, it shouldn't be going in and out of the dealership to be fixed and if it is, the customer services element should be doing everything they can to make it easier for the customer to continue their normal day. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before I end up back in, attempting to get issues fixed again."
3/13/18,5,"From start to finish my experience was imaculate. I found my perfect Mini at the Inchcape in Croydon. The York one got my Mini from there and carried on the most perfect service. I was nervous about a new car as iv had bad past experiences with dealerships but Becky Atkin was amazing! Friendly, professional and so knowledgable she got everything sorted and i love my new car! Definately worth the drive from Manchester. Becky is a credit to Mini! Thank you!"
3/13/18,5,"You need to feel that you are leaving your car with someone you can trust, and who has fully understood any snags you report. Service advisor David Johnson fits the bill perfectly! Dropped the car at 0930, wife and self crossed Langford Lane to get a park and ride bus into the city centre. Call at lunchtime to say rear brake discs and pads needed to be replaced. Agreed OK after seeing a video of the underside, inc. rear brakes (well done Matthew Noon - a good movie!). Park and ride bus back to Langford Lane and picked up clean car at agreed time. No hassle. Great experience."
3/13/18,4,"Initially my experience was not great as Charles wasn’t very good at communication and led us to believe my car was arriving January
Then when I had to chase him I got informed of the delay
When Phil took over I can only say my experience was excellent and Phil kept in communication and was very helpful and gave excellent customer service and made what was looking like a not good experience into an enjoyable one"
3/13/18,5,All done very professionally.
3/13/18,5,"Visited branch for MOT. Service was prompt and efficient. Also carried out brake fluid change which was due.
Charges were reasonable and staff friendly.
Will visit again when full service is due."
3/13/18,5,"Matt was very helpful on the service reception
Five stars Will definitely come back
Thank you Maidstone Audi"
3/12/18,2,Not impressed had to take car twice have time off work to fix a light and spent 5 hours there! Not a good service had to keep ringing them to find out when I could bring my car back.
3/12/18,5,"The work was done within the time specified, all members of staff were friendly, professional and polite. Was made welcome and would highly recommend."
3/12/18,4,"I was met with a courtesy car which kept me on the road all day.

When I picked up the car, I was told that the parts for the recall had not yet been made available, so unfortunately I will have to have another day without my Passat."
3/12/18,5,"Recently purchased a new Q5 from Tetbury Audi. I was kept informed throughout the order cycle with regular updates.
From agreeing a deal to arranging finance was a relatively straightforward experience.
The handover was fantastic, I had some specific requirements all of which were dealt with, which was especially pleasing and showed a high level of attention to detail. Special thanks to Graham Owen for his extremely professional handling of the entire process."
3/12/18,5,I have only ever received excellent service from extremely helpful and professional staff . I would recommend this organisation without any hesitation.
3/12/18,4,Sales were helpful and clear in communication. I did not feel overly pressured and feel that I was given a fair deal. Car was ready on delivery and they made an effort to make the experience enjoyable. As this was my sons first car this was appreciated.
3/12/18,4,It was easy to get a service - booked online and from that point it continued to very easy. Video text sent showing the service and text message to say the car was ready. Would recommend.
3/12/18,5,Very good service. Not pressurised but given lots of information and time to make a decision.
3/12/18,5,"Excellent service. Guv took time to answer my questions.
I would recommend Mercedes Stratford-upon-Avon."
3/12/18,5,Always reliable and nice people to deal with!
3/12/18,5,Excellent help and support from Ben throughout.
3/12/18,5,"Efficient,Friendly, Helpful. Will be using Coopers again."
3/12/18,5,Excellent service throughout.
3/12/18,5,"Great service!
Best dealer experience I've had"
3/12/18,5,"Excellent service car collected from home, had cam belt fitted and drive belt and fuel filter. A very competitive price. Car returned washed and vacuumed. I was kept informed throughout. 5 star service"
3/12/18,5,"My partner and myself booked both our cars in at the same time, we were well looked after, greeted with a cup of coffee and a smile, the service we received was second to none, we arranged to be taken over to the local shopping centre by an audi driver while our cars were being serviced and we were collected when the cars were ready, all the paperwork was done and dusted in a short time, and to our surprise we were given a gift of a very expensive bottle of champagne, wow ! amazing customer service and a lovely end to a good day"
3/12/18,4,Service Advisor was very helpful along with a guy from the workshop.
3/12/18,5,"Excellent service from Oliver Potts, knowledgeable and helpful throughout the purchasing process!"
3/12/18,5,Very professional and helpful!
3/12/18,5,Thank you so much for all your help! Found a car with everything I needed on it!
3/12/18,5,"Very helpful, great communications, friendly and able to accomodate several requests; only issue is that they are expensive but otherwise they are brilliant"
3/12/18,2,"I am very happy with the mot, but very disappointed that I asked that whilst they had my car all day please could they give me a price for my truck as I was interested in upgrading to a new car, I asked on 3 different occasions for this to happen. When I came to collect my car they had not done this for me, the only bonus is I get to keep my car but they lost a sale! . I left unhappy and the service man knew I was cross but they still did not even call me to see if they could sort it !"
3/12/18,5,Excellent service I would recommend this company
3/12/18,1,"To spare you all reading the details, I will strongly advise you 'DO NOT USE THIS GROUP AGAIN'. I will definitely NEVER use their services again.
Cooper BMW was a great disappointment as they charged me for items that were not necessary but they held me hostage by telling me the MOT will fail otherwise. The windscreen wipers were not as bad as they said (I use them so I know how they were) and they incorrectly told me that a headlight lamp was blown whereas it was only the parking light that was not working(that does not make a car fail MOT). This added around a £100 to the bill. It is shameful to think that Cooper BMW will resort to cheap tactics only dodgy corner garages resort to extract the most out of their customers. To make it all really worse, the car was handed back with an alloy wheel damaged (it only had minor scruffs previously) while the interior was left really dirty (with foot marks inside)."
3/12/18,4,"Excellent feedback about my own car, good reception, welcome coffee and good courtesy car.

Treated like a valued customer and person rather than just a number !"
3/12/18,5,My car went in for an MOT and during the time spent my interaction with those taking of my service was very professional and informative regarding my service history. All in all excellent.
3/12/18,1,"We have always been very happy with the service we have received from Hunters but this was not the case on this occasion. We were told the service would take 2 hours ,when we arrived we were informed it would be approximately 3 hours. There are no longer any newspapers to pass the time and the TV was not working.
The car was supposed to have been cleaned on the outside but there were bird droppings on the roof and the tyres were still dirty. There was a small paintwork mark on the roof which ,when I mentioned it to the female receptionist,she replied that we might as well touch it up ourselves as it was so small. This is not the response I expected from a prestigious company such as Hunters."
3/12/18,1,"Our Company bought a Volkswagen from West London VW. It was supposed to be delivered on Friday, but failed to arrive. The sales person said he couldn't find the address and didn't have my telephone number to ask for directions!!

They had received the money 'up front' for the vehicle and seemed to be completely unconcerned that our residents with Learning Disabilities would be left without a vehicle for the weekend. They had been looking forward to seeing the new car all day."
3/12/18,5,"Really pleased with the service from Audi Crawley and in particular Darren Ballard. I was looking for a nearly new A5 with a particular specification that they didn't have. One was found 150 miles away and transported to the Crawley showroom for me to view without obligation, can't ask for better than that! Car was perfect and purchased, the whole process was smooth and simple with good communication throughout."
3/12/18,5,"Hannah Smith oversaw that process from start to finish.
I could not have asked for more, indeed, she exceeded all my expectations.
I would thoroughly recommend Audi Inchscape, Crawley to anyone considering buying a new or used car.
Thank you."
3/12/18,5,"Organised, polite, did exactly as requested. Exceeded my expectations, clear customer service ethic. Excellent."
3/12/18,5,"On my 3rd Audi from Swindon, always easy to get hold of and talk about every part of the process. Actually live closer to Oxford Audi, and when purchasing this car at the same time as getting my partners from Oxford it showed how much better they are! It was a joy to purchase from Swindon compared to the constant unreturned calls and argueing with Oxford. Just make sure you book a appointment as they're always busy."
3/12/18,5,Excellent service
3/12/18,4,"Reception was not up to usual high standard, my car papers weren’t ready, and I didn’t appear to be on the list. However, once this element was sorted all was fine and I was pleased with the way I was dealt with by Laura Bigwood."
3/12/18,3,"Usual mix of calls not returned, indifference, missing sales reps in the showroom and take it or leave it selling. There is no negotiation on price apart from they will flex it to include selling an insurance to you - presumably commision on that? The non-selling technical folks are excellent btw I've visited a few BMW showrooms and this is no better nor worse - it is a bang average experience these days"
3/12/18,5,"Very professional.
Happy to refer this firm"
3/12/18,5,All the staff at the Colchester branch are very helpful and go out of there way to make your visit a very enjoyable one.
3/12/18,5,Very friendly and helpful.Do not try to sell you what you don't want.I would recommend this dealership.
3/12/18,5,I arrived early but they opened up and dealt with me. My car was serviced and I was called exactly when they said they would. All round an easy and problem free experience. The service person was excellent.
3/12/18,5,"Service was prompt, friendly and staff were very knowledgeable."
3/12/18,5,the service I received was excellant
3/12/18,3,"Nothing wrong with the work done by mini but the dealership has to be one of the worst places to sit. No coffee machines, individual tables, nothing to read, tv etc. I’m comparing to the Mercedes dealership that we use for husbands car. I dread having to wait for work to be done. It’s so impersonal"
3/12/18,3,"The servicing and support service was fantastic, however there was no internet available and I had agreed to wait for my vehicle on the basis I could work via the internet. They had a cloud which was not compatible with my PC and was unsecured. If they had told me in advance then I could have made alternative plans, as it was I had to try and work on my phone which was not ideal."
3/12/18,3,"Had 3 appointments booked with Inchcape and not one was dealt with promptly, waiting time was approximately 90, 60 and 20 minutes for the respective bookings. This was very annoying as had to drive nearly 20 miles each time. We only dealt with ""our"" sales rep for a period on the first visit and he was unable to conclude the sales deal. On subsequent two visits he came over shock my hand and apologised for not dealing with me, leaving me to deal with other members of their sales team.
When asked to review my overall experience on final visit they had difficulty in accepting my mark of 6-7 out of 10 and tried to persuade me to mark higher - which I declined.
Impression was the customer could wait as there were plenty of others to replace me."
3/12/18,5,Great service experience on my first inspection on my Touareg.
3/12/18,4,"Had real problems when I called booking desk to try to describe particular urgent need to ensure Noon pick up after MoT next day.
Very rigid and seemed unable to understand circumstances. After asking for transfer to someone with authority I was connected with Ryan whose arrangements, close attention and very pleasant demeanour were first class."
3/12/18,5,Everything went like clock work from them calling to arrange a date for the service and mot to them collecting and returning the vehicle. Very professional.
3/12/18,5,Excellent experience - no issues
3/12/18,2,"First contact good by phone but when going to the service centre had to wait to be seen then the man was grumpy and then seen by a young lady who was very helpful . and on collection didn't really give any idea of what was wrong but suggest i trade it in for new car then stated it could be the transmission or rear diff which could cost lots of money .
Got to say i got more information from the web site which didn't cost me £90
Oh well"
3/12/18,5,An outstanding experience from start to finish. Dan couldn’t do anymore for us. Very happy customers!
3/12/18,5,"Excellent customer service from Rebecca. Kept me informed at all stages of my delivery and kept me at ease.

Would def use again"
3/12/18,5,We had excellent and first rate service from Chris Gomes at Cooper Croydon. Would certainly deal with him again. I’ve bought a number of cars from Cooper and hope to do so in future.
3/12/18,5,Efficient and pleasant
3/12/18,5,"Responsive, managed my expectations and provided post repair feedback."
3/12/18,5,"Very friendly, very helpful with any questions you have and make you feel valued as a customer."
3/10/18,5,"Standard of service and attention to customer was first class.
Claire Hart was very polite and informative.
Made to feel very welcome from the moment I walked into the showroom.
Also, contacted about an issue and video sent straight to phone. I think this is a very good idea.
All in all excellent.
And I shall be returning in the future."
3/10/18,5,Welcoming staff and good service
3/10/18,3,We were told we could not choose our new registration as they were not out yet. When the paper was shown to us we had 3 to chose from and all those taken had dates prior to us being told they were not out yet. Many of the Reg that had been taken had meaning for us. We and family have always had good service and bought many new cars and this little touch of having a good choice meant something to us but was denied this time
3/10/18,4,A lot of (unnecessary) fancy extras which is presumably why VW charge a lot for a service.
3/10/18,5,"Washers on car had stopped working appointment was booked for 8.30 am I was met on arrival and out by 9.30 excellent service car was cleaned and washed before I left.
Mini service was done everything ok video to show what had been done and emailed to me I was most impressed."
3/10/18,1,"Our car has been already 3 times at MINI Reading for investigation as it seems that there is something wrong with it's fuel consumption. Our MINI cooper shows an average of 35 mpg which is unacceptable for a one year old car.
On November last year, MINI Reading agreed to investigate the issue. When we collected the car we were advised to monitor the fuel consumption for a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, the situation didn’t improve.
The car went back for further inspection in December. MINI Reading were unable to identify the root cause of the problem and contacted MINI Germany for further advise.
As we weren't contacted back, we called again in January to arrange a new appointment and the car spent another day at MINI Reading just to be told that they couldn't do further test as they didn't have a car similar than ours to compare performance.
We haven't been contacted by MINI Reading since. We are still waiting to hear from them with further instructions. We in return, called various times to get an update or a report to confirm the findings and the actual fuel consumption without any success.
We asked to talk to the manager Paul Smith but he is not returning our calls or replying to our email.
The car is still under warranty until next year and MINI is not taking the issue seriously.
Very bad customer service experience so far."
3/10/18,5,I have owned my Audi A3 for just over a year and I have been very impressed with the aftersales service at Inchcape. I have found them very helpful and have taken full advantage of their free health check and wash service! I also love my car!

3/9/18,5,Our experience of buying our new car from Audi Cheshire Oaks was extremely good. Despite not having an appropriate car for us to test drive on our first visit they allowed us to examine an equivalent Audi Approved car which had already been sold.This convinced us that it was the model we wanted. A test drive was arranged for us soon after and we decided to proceed with a purchase. All the options available were explained clearly to us which made it easy for us to choose exactly what we wanted.At no point during this process was any pressure put on us to make a purchase. When we picked up the car we were given an initial 2 hour slot for the demonstration of the functions we were interested in and told we could have futher sessions if required. We were very impressed with the service we received from our sales person and all other personnel who dealt with us...... and we love our car!
3/9/18,5,"Excellent in everywhere, Jo your Service Agent was just fantastic."

3/9/18,5,Prompt efficient service by far the best MB service agent I have used during the last 12 years.
3/9/18,4,"Very good overall service . Couple of small points which might have made it to 5 star ! 1) I work in a very variable occupation , where hours and locations vary dramatically . I agreed a 3.30 pick up time , but actually asked for a phone call if it was done early so I could pop in and pick up early . I know it was done first thing as I had a health check emailed to me at about 9.30, but this seemed an impossible request . Also I often think that if you are going to do a courtesy car , what would be a good idea , is to have a reasonably high spec courtesy car, not necessarily new , up to a few years old , as you are also selling second hand cars , and extra bells and whistles are what interests me as a buyer as my normal car is pretty basic for business efficiency, and some extras to drive around with for a day would definitely make me want to add them more , or at least see what they were like . Just a thought ..."
3/9/18,5,"I had a couple of minor issues with my 3 year old Beetle which needed workshop attention. My domestic circumstances are such that I need my car almost at a moments notice. Inchcape Stockport were able to accommodate me in terms of when the issues could be addressed, even offering me the use of a car in the meantime. The staff are extremely helpful and considerate. I would like to award Russell, one of the service representatives, 5 Gold Stars, for his considerations in ensuring that I was minimally inconvenienced. Great Service!"
3/9/18,5,"I was seen very quickly and professionally, great service provided and was grateful for the information I was given regarding a car I recently bought from another Audi main dealer who I have not been to pleased with.

3/9/18,5,"Booked in quickly, on arrival was greeted politely, went to the reception where I was dealt with straight away with someone who was competent, polite and helpful.
I explained the the fault seemed to have cured itself, so she said rather than lose the car for the day she liaised with the engineer who would check the car straight away. Free vacuum and wash and I was on my way, free coffee while I waited as well."
3/9/18,5,"Mark Allen provided an excellent service, appraising the vehicle accurately, taking the stress out of making the purchase. First class experience and would recommend Inchcape to anyone looking to purchase a new or approved car."

Had to wait till 5:20pm for paperwork. Not recommended"

I then received a prompt confirmation e mail of the date and time, with information about what I needed to take with me! I took the car in at the agreed time, and was greeted by a lovely lady who was efficient and friendly! The car was ready a couple of hours before the agreed time, and a message left on our answer phone to let us know! When we returned to collect the car it had been cleaned and valeted, and any queries had been reported on! The lady came out with us to the car to make sure we were happy, and told us to call if we had any further queries! All in all a great experience!"

3/8/18,5,"We recently purchased our new Mercedes C Class Convertible from Mercedes Warrington , it was an excellent experience from beginning to end. A massive thankyou goes to Anthony Kelly who looked after us from start to finish and he was fabulous. He went above and beyond to give us an unforgettable experience,his customer service was excellent and he made it a pleasure to visit. We would definitely recommend purchasing a car from the Warrington showroom."
3/8/18,5,"Easy to book an appointment via the main Inchcape number and managed to get a time slot I wanted. The staff on the day were really polite and courteous, they explained up front how long it would be before car was ready and they kept to this.

3/8/18,5,Exceptional service throughout
3/8/18,5,"Good, prompt service."
3/8/18,5,"I cannot compliment Richard and Stuart enough. Buying the Evoke has been one of the best buying experiences of my life. I’ve always wanted a Range Rover and these 2 guys made it everything I’d thought it would be. Never pushy, very helpful and very friendly. You have a customer for life and I will highly recommend them to my friends. I just hope everyone else can live up to them.
Many Thanks"

3/8/18,5,"Jonathan Brotherdale at Stockport Audi made my experience absolutely amazing - from start to finish! he is a real credit to the company and a shining star. He goes the extra mile and nothing is a problem for him. I took home my Audi Q2 last night, beaming with pride and so excited - Jonny made my car buying experience super exciting and was always smiling!"
3/8/18,5,"Second service under a free 2yr service plan included on car purchase.
They were busy but paid full attention to me on arrival and Paul (the service manager) was excellent. Car was ready on time and the report covered with all work done.

3/8/18,5,"Very good experience from start to finish. Martyn was extremely helpful, an excellent deal was negotiated that we were both happy with and the car arrived as promised without any hitch."
3/8/18,2,"My Mercedes C250 Estate was recalled so I booked it into Thor Nottingham Inchcape dealership. Booking the appointment was Ok, however, on arrival parking was very difficult with double parking everywhere, we entered the main entrance and approached the empty Reception desk. There were no signs or indication where the service dept. was and we wandering around for several minutes looking for someone, I approached a member of staff in an open plan office who offerred to find someone, but it took another 5 minutes before the Receptionist returned and told us to take a seat.. A service person came out to us and took my keys saying it would take 30 mins. He told us to come back to reception after our visit to an adjacent store.
We returned after 40 mins to find the Reception once again empty, fortunately the Service person had followed us through the main entrance and asked us to take a seat saying it would 2 minutes, but in fact was 10 minutes.
The reception should always be attended as it is the primary point of contact for service, parts and sales."
3/8/18,5,"Went to Inchcape with a problem on my DAB Radio, it kept cutting out.
Jamie had one of his techies look out it but couldn,t understand the problem.
Vehicle was booked in again for the following week for 2days to either find and repair the fault or exchange the radio unit. 4hrs after leaving the vehicle with them Jamie calls me to tell me they,ve rectified the fault, found the cause as well.
I was kept informed of progress at all times. Jamie, the Service Manager, very courtious, efficient and helpful.
I, m not a great fan of Main Dealers but I would go back to Inchcape Southend in the future. Thanks Jamie"
3/8/18,5,"I have had over the last 3-4 years purchased cars from INCHCAPE Mercedes dealership Warrington.
During this time I have received excellent service from both their Sales and Service Team.
I am a retired Aircraft Engineer at Bae Systems and was Spares Manager for over twenty years, and as such I am familiar with what Customer Service is all about. And I can in all honesty say that Customer Service, is well exercised by Mercedes-Benz of Warington"
3/8/18,5,"Very welcoming staff on reception who were very friendly. Staff member who dealt with my issue was very polite and more than happy to help.
Service I received was of a high standard and is what I would expect when walking into the showroom."
3/8/18,5,Very thorough and professional service from Coppers BMW Norwich thank you.

3/8/18,5,"The service advisor , Ellie, was really friendly and helpful. Kept me informed about the progress of the service. She asked me if I used the Apps available which I do not. She offered to help me but I declined."
3/8/18,3,"A simple job - I was told twice would take only one hour, so decided to wait for the car in the showroom, only to find it took 1 hour and 45 minutes. Bit of a bore sitting there."
3/8/18,5,"Just traded in my XK for a new F Pace S and enjoyed the whole process thoroughly. From entering the showroom to driving away with a new 18 reg car was a great experience. The salesman I dealt with is Ash Brear. He kept me informed of where we were concerning car build, delivery dates, options etc, etc. Well done Ash!
Just had the gleaming car for one day but enjoying the whole experience, well done to all of you!"
3/8/18,5,"Professional, polite service looked after me and my car very well. No complaints."

3/8/18,5,Efficient and on time. Free wifi and coffee.
3/8/18,5,"The moment we arrived to discuss RS4 Avant, Jeff was very helpful and more importantly had all the answers we needed.

I wouldn’t hesitate to go back and buy another vehicle from Jeff. Great service and easy to deal with from order to handover."
3/8/18,5,"Enjoyed my time their.charged me resionable.everything done very profesionally.
Thankyou"
3/8/18,5,excellent customer service by Wendy.
3/8/18,4,"James our Service Advisor was smart & gave a good impression.
I pointed out to him we had received 5 contacts confirming appointment over the last week. Some co ordination required from the Company.
As there were no issues re my vehicle it is difficult to judge
How would he respond if we had a difficulty??"
3/8/18,5,Excellent friendly customer service.
3/8/18,5,"I was originally connected to Adam who was extremely personable & understood exactly what I was looking for. I arranged to go to Liverpool & then also met Kal & between them, they looked after me very well.
We agreed a deal & the car I wanted was made available within a few days & it was delivered to me yesterday
All I need now is training!! as the manual is over 500 pages
Kal is arranging this for me this weekend- very impressed"
3/8/18,1,"I have given one star because I had to. The service I received at Tunbridge Wells Audi has been awful throughout the process of buying a new car. They have been lacking in commmunication and the onus has been on me to chase them at each stage. I feel like they have totally messed me around, and lied to me. This was my first new car and as such was a ‘big deal’ for me. By the end, I was so fed up with ther service, that I didn’t even want the car. I would highly recommend you go to another Audi dealership!!"
3/8/18,5,Our visit to BMW Durham for MOT was very pleasant and there were no problems. The staff were efficient and friendly and the meal at the Beefeater after my car was ready was very much appreciated. Thank you very much.
3/8/18,5,"Purchased a new car recently from Lexus Guildford- my 4th Lexus. The sales guy Rhys was really great to deal with. Having a disabled daughter we have very specific needs. He was extremely helpful,patient, understanding and I felt was working with us to make the right decision.
He kept in touch with us not in a nuisance way but in a helpful one. Lexus level of service is always excellent but it is very easy to take it for granted. A big thank you to Rhys."
3/8/18,1,Car booked in for warranty work. For personal reasons I needed a loan car. When I turned up I was denied the car and what is worse I was sat around for nearly 3 hours and I swear they loaned my car to someone while I was waiting as it lost a quarter tank of fuel in 3 hours and the seats had all been moved. I was looking to switch to a new yaris on motability now I am selling my current car in favour of a Ford because I daren't risk being dealt with by this inconsiderate mob again
3/8/18,5,Immediate recognition on arrival by host and without delay passed onto service adviser. Advised by phone when car was ready and minimum of delay to see service adviser before collection of vehicle.
3/8/18,5,"No drama with Cooper Sunderland. My car was booked in for warranty checks, brake service and MOT. From welcome to departure the service was exceptional. Ellie kept me up to date on my vehicle progress and provided a video of the inspection which I thought was truly impressive. Comfort requirements are all to hand with the team and the social contact with them highlights the standard of intellectual reach and product knowledge. It really is an amazing facility so BMW should be truly proud of how the company is presented by a truly impressive operation."
3/8/18,5,Excellent service and great customer experience. No surprises. I’d be happy to recommend them to anyone.
3/8/18,5,Great experience and service.
3/8/18,5,"Amanda was my service agent. She was extremely helpful and accommodating. My car was finished by lunchtime to pick up outside of rush hour, which I really appreciated. She even went out of her way to answer a sales question I had regarding car play."
3/8/18,4,Good experience of the service at EK audi however i was told it would take 1 hour but ended up being 2 hours with noone advising of this further time needed. If you are in a rush or arw expecting it to be only 1 hour it is not ideal. Luckily my appts were in the afternoon so i was in no rush.
3/8/18,5,"Simple, efficient, effective. An excellent experience."
3/8/18,5,"Usual good, seamless service"
3/8/18,5,"Polite, efficient, on time and a free loan car whilst mine was being serviced.
Returned to me fully valeted and all at a reasonable cost. Whats' not to love?"
3/8/18,5,Great service reception. All my options well explained. No hard sell. Invoice matched quote. All good.
3/8/18,4,Overall good with some delays on order but extras helped and Max McKendrick was very helpful when called upon.
3/8/18,4,"I had a very pleasant buying experience at Mercedes Inchcape Warrington. I dealt wit Tony Kelly through out and at no time did i feel pressured into making a decision on my purchase. Tony has been professional throughout the whole process from initial enquiry to hand over even putting himself out when transferring my cherished number.
I only give 4 stars because i thought the exterior of the car could've been given a once over prior to handover to clean it up but given the weather conditions that morning probably this is being bit picky. Wouldn't,t hesitate to recommend Tony"
3/8/18,5,"The service in Twickenham was great, keeping me fully updated every step of the way - I dealt with Henry who delivered fantastic customer service from start to finish."
3/8/18,5,Very polite and friendly service. Excellent.
3/8/18,5,By far the best friendliest and unpressured car buying experience possible.
3/8/18,5,Friendly staff and well looked after. Car serviced quick and professionaly.
3/7/18,5,Delighted by the customer care and quality of service.
3/7/18,5,"Excellent service.
Emily went out of her way and our high expectations were exceeded."
3/7/18,5,Very easy to deal with. Everyone very welcoming and helpful. Workmen very professional.
3/7/18,5,"We had a great experience purchasing our new car from Liverpool and Lee was great....he looked after us and found exactly what we wanted.
We are really satisfied with the whole experience and would recommend to anyone who’s seriously looking to buying a new car. Thanks for everything Lee 😊"
3/7/18,5,"Everything was done to make the Service visit a pleasant experience. Good coffee, pleasant working environment, fast efficient service."
3/7/18,1,"I took my car for its MOT at Inchcape VW Exeter on 06/03/18. VW identified £370 worth of works needed to fix an exhaust casing / muffler. The car has only been driven for 50 miles since the same VW garage undertook the last MOT on 28th March 2017 (it has been kept, covered, in a dry garage since its 2017 MOT, having basically been driven back from the VW garage to home and then left motionless for a year). VW provide video footage of the underside of the car to clients when undertaking MOTs. I have the video footage from the 2017 MOT which shows the part of the exhaust in question in okay condition (50 miles wear ago – some rust is evident, as it the case with all non-stainless steel exhaust systems, but the exhaust part in question is wholly intact) but the 2018 footage shows the same part of the exhaust very badly damaged. There is zero evidence in my own garage that the part in question 'fell apart' therein. It is inconceivable that there would be no indication in my own garage of the damage evident on VW's 06/03/18 video had the damage occurred in my own garage, which makes me wonder if the damage occured in VW's inspection pit when the latest MOT was undertaken. It’s not possible to give a ‘zero stars’ review on TrustPilot, but if I could I would. I am in touch with BBC ‘Watchdog’ about this experience."
3/7/18,5,Absolutely wonderful service for my vw golf and me..... car picked up n brought back to me . No inconvenience at all... car returned and there is an email awaiting me regarding the service i had done. Video of it too!!!! Plus my own service manager showing me round and underneath my car.... fabulous n eye opening!!!. Car vacuumed n washed also. Never have i had a better service from anywhere else than from VW Inchape. Definitely worth the 5 stars in every way. Pleased as punch.
3/7/18,5,very professional from start to finish.
3/7/18,4,"Friendly & co-operative
Excellent salesmanship (David Singh) who gave us ample time to try & decide about our car options. Although there were some confusing options in the Mercedes catalogue while selecting my preferences for the E-class which led me not having the Traffic Speed limits on the satnav & a rather below standard audio system for myself, not to mean it for everyone, still a good audio system for an average listener."
3/7/18,5,"Excellent service. . Nothing to much trouble. Very efficient. Thanks to Adrian, Brian and the whole team."
3/7/18,5,From the time I spent in the service area from the time I left I found the staff to be well mannered and customer friendly. Nothing appeared too much trouble and all questions were answered in a professional manner. The vehicle was ready when I turned up at the allotted time and the loan car borrowed was of a high quality. Would use again for car service and MOT.
3/7/18,5,"We were held up in traffic and our taxi had arrived before we got the car booked in (they were very busy that morning). However, they asked the taxi to wait while they booked us in quickly so we were able to get the taxi. They phoned us to let us know it had passed its MOT, and again when the car was ready for collection. Also love the little video of the health check they send you."
3/7/18,5,"Excelent costumer service. Mini colchester
Thank for your professional way of dealing with the costumers."
3/7/18,5,I was kept very well informed by Abbie throughout the day.
3/7/18,4,"The service carried out to my car was undertaken promptly and in a professional manner. I was advised that my front tyres would need replacement in the not too distant future but I wasn't pressurised into having this carried out during the service.

I would always recommend Mini Tonbridge. However, I would mention that on both dropping off my car and collecting it there was no one on the main reception desk. I stood for a while waiting and a couple of other staff members did walk by but no one approached me. The receptionist did eventually appear and looked after me. Perhaps a bell on the desk might be useful for when the receptionist has to leave the desk.

The courtesy car I was offered for the day was a delight to drive and a good quality vehicle. My own car was returned having been given a wash and brush up which was a nice touch."
3/7/18,5,Excellent service from inch cape. Yhere was no delay in my car being booked in for repair and I have to say Martin (the driver who took me to work) is great.
3/7/18,5,"I was impressed by every aspect of the service. I was able to book a date and time of my choosing, staff were courteous and efficient, and the car was ready at the appointed time. First class."
3/7/18,4,Overall the service I received was ecellent. I only have one complaint and that was that my car hadn't been cleaned as well as usual. The front wheels still had brake dust and the car was very smeary. Not important I know but still a disappointment.
3/7/18,5,"I had been looking at cars for several weeks trying to decide which car to buy, I went to Mazda Swindon garage to test drive the new CX3, I did feel a little pressured to put a deposit down after the test drive, every time we discussed monthly figures the sales man disappeared into manager office to seek advice this happened 2 or 3 times in the end i wondered why the manager didn't just come out and do the deal himself !!! due to the pushy sales man wanting me to put deposit down immediately I decided I didn't want to be pressured and I left Mazda and went to Audi Swindon car showroom - what a difference , the whole experience was calm, professional, friendly, genuine sales person (Eddie), there was no hard sell, he spent time with me talking through cars and different options, I arranged to go back again to test drive the Audi A1 on the VIP weekend , again on 2nd visit no hard sell just professional and friendly made to feel at ease over taking time to make a big decision, (no pushy talk of deposits and rates changing if i didn't sign up that day like Mazda ) I had the test drive and we agreed on the sale, the manager also came over to shake my hand and welcome me to Audi, I would recommend anyone looking to change their car go Audi Swindon first , I am loving my new bright red Audi AI S line thanks Eddie"
3/7/18,4,"The efficiency of the service on my car couldn't be faulted, from the video right through to collecting the car from James at Chelmsford. There was a glitch when I brought the car in when I had to wait for half an hour or so but maybe there was a communication breakdown. These things happen and I will be returning to the dealer, probably in a year's time when I will be looking for a new car."
3/7/18,5,Excellent from start to finish.
3/7/18,5,"Excellent service as always, car dropped off and out again in a loan car (the ever enjoyable Mini Cooper) within 10 mins. Work completed by 11:30 with accompanying video of feedback from health check for that all important transparency. Went to collect about 4:30 during peak business for service dept, all done and on the road within 10 minutes again. Very impressed!"
3/7/18,5,"Excellent Service all round from Inchcape VW Romford

Special Thanks to Wayne Franklin at VW"
3/7/18,5,Service was excellent on time and staff were friendly knowledgeable and “on the balll”.
3/7/18,5,In for an airbag recall. Very pleasant staff would recommend
3/7/18,5,My car was collected and serviced by Crawley Audi. Any work required was discussed and they sent me a video explaining the issues. The staff were polite and well turned out in uniform. The workshop is spotless giving confidence in not only a job well done but also h&s and environmental responsibilities have been met. Wouldn't trust my car anywhere else.
3/7/18,5,"Excellent service
The whole experience handled by Martin went very smooth including the handover where everything was clearly explained"
3/7/18,5,Perfect . Thank you Nicole
3/7/18,5,"Very helpful, great client care and kept informed."
3/7/18,5,Professional in every way
3/7/18,5,"Everyone at Mercedes Warrington was great, great, quick service, the video of the car service was a good touch aswell. Thanks."
3/7/18,5,Excellent treatment and a bonus valet as well. Cheers
3/7/18,5,Very professional and excellent service. Very friendly staff especially Wendy Hall who went the extra mile to deliver a perfect service. Thank you
3/7/18,3,"The collection service was great.
I got a phone call fairly quickly to explain the advisory indications.
I chose to have 2 new tyres fitted at the same time as the service.
Payment was easy enough but what I think was disappointing was the number of times the free wash and vacuum was mentioned versus the quality of the service. My car was by no means dirty inside but it really didn’t look like it had been cleaned. All the dust that it left with, was returned. I spent £603 yesterday. A proper valet would have exceeded expectations but don’t overplay a free add on that’s below par. If you hadn’t told me you were doing it I wouldn’t have noticed and wouldn’t have been underwhelmed."
3/7/18,5,"Took my Jaguar there for its first service. James White is exceptional professional and provided a first class friendly service. Nice video to show me what they had checked, and from dropping off the car to picking it up, I was fully informed of the progress. Car was immaculately clean, when picked up, nice touch, well done HA Fox"
3/7/18,5,"I chose the new car I wanted. Sales staff helpful, no pressure.
The new show room is spacious but the car park is too small."
3/7/18,5,Hope my service plan could be extended for five more years!
3/7/18,5,"Another excellent service to my Scirocco carried out by Inchcape Twickenham.
Very many thanks!"
3/7/18,5,Just recently bought a used car from this dealership and the journey from start to finish was exceptional. We got a great deal on our trade in and the new car was pristine despite being used. Everything we were promised we received and the customer service was second to none. Many thanks to Tony Foley who went out of his way to make this such a pleasant experience for us.
3/6/18,5,Great service from Michael Martin and Alvin
3/6/18,5,A member of staff drove me to work and picked me up in the evening when I forgot my driving licence so could not take the courtesy car when leaving my car for a service.
3/6/18,3,"Work carried out as required, but each time my car goes in the interior is dirtier when I get it back."
3/6/18,5,Very efficient service. Pleasant and helpful staff.
3/6/18,5,"I found service I received was second to none the staff were polite, friendly and very professional."
3/6/18,3,"Got sent video showing car needed a new tyre. I phoned, selected option 4, car already on site, got put through to parts! They put me through to service, just rang out no answer. I rang again selected option 4 again was put through to parts again, they directed my call to reception, I asked for service, they put me through to an off site central booking team who couldn’t help. Had to call again and left message, was very frustrated. Regards Duncan Bryce"

3/6/18,5,"Car in for MoT on 5th March 2018. Experienced a friendly, efficient and professional service. I'm not saying this because my car passed! Would recommend."
3/6/18,5,The advice and assistance from the sales team and especially Nigel Beckett has been absolutely excellent!
3/6/18,5,"I have just purchased my third BMW from Coopers in Chelmsford, I have always found them to be professional, efficient anf friendly."
3/6/18,5,Friendly and helpful. Video of health check.
3/6/18,5,"We wanted a new car, were clear about our budget and timescales, and visited the showroom to sort this out. Forgetting in the meantime, as we don’t buy cars all that often, about MOT dates, organising insurance (BMW used to give a free month to ease this challenge so first time we’d had to arrange up front) and practicalities of handover. Despite us basically changing all the details of everything we’d agreed we are now successfully at home with our new car with no dramas!"
3/6/18,5,"Excellent, friendly customer service and attention to detail."
3/6/18,5,Excellent service from a very friendly and helpful member of staff who always goes that extra mile for his customers I would highly recommend inchcape if you are considering buying a new car
3/6/18,3,"First time I have not been offered a drink😡 service done while i waited , all ok washed car but left the boot inside dirty but they had hovered the footwell front and back 👍"
3/6/18,5,"Excellent service, would highly recommend. Used the garage twice now for services."

3/6/18,5,Great service from my local dealership.
3/6/18,5,"As far as after sales service is concerned, this is as good as it gets."
3/6/18,5,"This company is a pleasure to deal with, the staff are so polite without being over the top, friendly, efficient, get the job done, communication is excellent, and in general the place has a great atmosphere, and of course an added bonus hot refreshments offered upon entering||| i have had my car from new and is now eight years old and i cannot fault the customer service at Mini... Well done team Mini ...."
3/6/18,2,"Disappointed with the whole service booking in procedure from initial telephone call, through to arrival at the dealership to hand the keys over, lack of updates, lack of staff and finally delayed receipt of car and muddy drivers interior following the valet!"
3/6/18,1,"My appointment was at 10:00 waited till 11:00 went back to to ask receptioniest if they know I am here she said yeah they get the paper work ready, waited till 11:55 then I have asked another one on receptions desk then some one came apologised as he wasn’t aware I was there, after all service done as I have told them I have nock on the door plus a few little issues but they never have looked at the door wasn’t happy with the service after spending almost £700 never going back there again"
3/6/18,5,Honest and trustworthy service from Volkswagen. I needed a service and thought I needed two front tyres as had an advisory the previous year. Volkswagen called after inspection check and let me know the tyres were still more than OK and passed the MOT. Great service.
3/6/18,5,Excellent service with Amber being extremely helpful and efficient
3/6/18,5,They pulled out all the stops to resolve my problem especially as I just turned up without prior notice 👍
3/6/18,4,Picked up my vehicle for service on time as promised in the morning. Called to let me know the service was completed with no issues. Washed and returned it to me in the afternoon.
3/6/18,5,"Dropped the car off for service, the technicians/service dept. kept me informed of arising work, collected the valeted car at the end of the day as arranged. All were helpful, respectful and I am sure had I had issues with dropping the vehicle off or collecting, they would have pulled out all the stops to assist. A simple, smooth operation, led by helpful and attentive staff who were not overbearing, the experience enhanced by a cup of coffee at start and finish. To be honest, delivered what I have come to expect of Inchcape Jaguar, formally HA Fox."
3/6/18,5,Very easy and smooth online service booking system. Service itself and pick up and delivery of vehicle also very good. Will be using again next year.
3/6/18,5,"From the booking in process to have my mini serviced and MOTed to recieving it back the whole process was very smooth and I was dealt with by everyone in a friendly professional manner.

Thank you"
3/6/18,5,"Impressed with the transparency, early arrival of technician to pick up car, and general friendliness.

All in all also a lot cheaper than I'd expected."
3/6/18,5,"Despite the inchcape call centre in Norwich giving me incorrect info. I still rate the service received with 5 stars. Ellie the service receptionist at Sunderland BMW sorted it.
Nothing was too much trouble for them. Really pleased. I can compare them to Honda and Toyota because we have those cars in the household.
The BMW garage (Sunderland) does beat them all by a good bit."
3/6/18,5,"Great experiance going to Audi , Thank so much Dave and Joe for all your help I love my car :)"
3/6/18,3,"too long waiting time taking in & picking up the car. also the car had dirty gloves mark when I picked up, told the adviser."
3/6/18,5,Great dealership experience. Always helpful and car is ready on time and freshly cleaned.
3/6/18,5,"Excellent service, could not ask for anything more"
3/6/18,5,I was dealt with in a courteous and professional manner. Work was carried out timely and to excellent standard.
3/6/18,5,Great service from Mark Williams.. as always!
3/6/18,1,"It was very poor. the worst i have even experienced. They rang me up a day before my appointment which was booked around a month back, to change it to a Friday. They were unable to provide me a car, but they did order a taxi to take me back to my house. I didn't get a call from them to update me on the status of the service, and I tried calling them several times, but no one picked up the calls. Until 1730 hr i got a call, they saying that they will try to finish the job. They called again, about 10 minutes to tell me that they will send a taxi to pick me up to go to the garage to collect the car. At 1800 hr (time that they close), i was told that they can't do it, and will pick me up on the following day (on Saturday) at 0900 hr to go to the garage to pick up the car. The car wasn't cleaned as they promised to do. All in all, it was a really bad experience. I expect better service from BMW."
3/6/18,5,Excellent customer service from Miguel Neulaender and everyone at Cooper Cobham
3/6/18,5,Very good serice
3/5/18,5,"Helpful, friendly staff."
3/5/18,5,"Very professional and efficient service from the moment I drove my car in until it was collected, especially liked the video showing me the mechanic completing the health check."
3/5/18,5,I had an extremely pleasant experience of purchasing my vehicle at BMW Cobham. The member of staff I dealt with was professional whilst being friendly and patient. Dealing with all of my questions and request until I was totally satisfied.
3/5/18,5,Fantastic service & experience on purchasing my Aygo.
3/5/18,5,Excellent and very helpful.
3/5/18,5,Just can’t beat the quality of service.
3/5/18,4,"Had my doubts early on due to poor communication.
Later on in the process we found Mark Nice to be friendly and efficient."
3/5/18,5,Excellent service.
3/5/18,4,The sales team are decent people but primarily they are there for Cooper Thames Ditton; which I don't have a problem with and would like to think most people are aware of that too.
3/5/18,5,"Helpful, efficient and thorough"
3/5/18,3,Had a service on my car done.They forgot to fix a fault on the radio. Hmmmm....
3/5/18,5,"Very good service ,as always at Inchcape Colchester"
3/5/18,5,"First class service l, very helpful.

2nd time I have bought with them

Thanks"
3/5/18,5,"A really enjoyable experience, our salesman was Mr Martin Tickle and I have to say he was so pleasant and helpful, not anything like any other car salesman that we have dealt with.

By not being too pushy and more helpful it made the decision easier to purchase my new car.

Would definitely recommend going to Mercedes-Benz Warrington."
3/5/18,5,"Booked in advance for a set time which was honoured, so my expectations of duration and cost were both met. The service representative who I dealt with was a most personable and affable chap. I’ll be glad when they move to new premises in May though - the current site is too small with limited parking."
3/5/18,4,Took my car in for service and MOT on a snowy day. As always friendly reception and excellent workmanship. Great to see the staff getting into work despite the weather. No valet or cleaning due to pressure hose not working but minor issue.
3/5/18,5,"Very happy with my experience with Cooper BMW York. My contact was Garry Turgoose and from the start he was very informative, fast paced and friendly. Everything was sorted very quickly and i am very happy with the car and how everything was dealt with. The delivery driver was also very professional and made sure he showed me how everything worked in the car and went through all the paperwork with me. Thankyou!"
3/5/18,5,Excellent service by John T and all the team. Could not fault anyone and they made my family and I very welcome. On purchasing a new car John went through everything with me and it was a pleasure to deal with him. Many thanks!
3/5/18,5,"The rating is for the service team who were excellent. Professional polite and extremely helpful. Service team well done..
The sales team however were noticeable by their absence in the lofty offices away from customers like myself. I would have been interested in figures to change my car but I will make enquiries at a mini dealership near my work instead."
3/5/18,5,Had a wonderful experience felt like I had purchased a brand new car thank you so much
3/5/18,1,"very poor car failed mot on a corroded brake pipe,quoted £1150 to replace pipe,my amg c63 was taken to another mot station and passed with flying colours,also my car electronic seat belt failed replaced under warranty and was fitted incorrectly, it has a twist in it,the car had a courtesy wash and they cracked the front number plate support bracket even left a bit of rag in crack but cant prove this,i have had a quote of around £120 to replace the brake pipe,front discs and pads need replacing again quoted nearly £2000 getting job done with genuine parts for £700,Im not pleased and will be emailing the Ceo of mercedes in germany."
3/5/18,4,"motability car needed M.O.T and even tho'the weather was awful-snow and ice,the car was collected from my home and delivered back to me.I've dealt with other companies which would not have done this"
3/5/18,5,"From the moment we dropped the car off for a service until the time we collected it, we were dealt with very politely and courteously. They informed us straight away when the car was ready for collection and explained to us everything that they had done to the car and also sent us a video link of the cars underside inspection which included some advice on the tyres.
The car had also been valeted to a high standard when we collected it.
The service man who dealt with us was called Frank at the Bolton garage"
3/5/18,5,This was a routine service for a BMW 3 series. The service provided was excellent and the executive handling my vehicle was very efficient keeping me informed of the progress and options available right up to completion/delivery back to me.
3/5/18,5,"Mercedes of Southport, great service, Stewart Lane worked hard to find the exact car I wanted at the price I could afford!"
3/5/18,5,"Was checked in on time - always a good start. Was given an estimate for the potential work, which they stuck to - also good. The works seemed expensive but this is BMW dealership so this shouldn't really be a surprise. Service and work completed broadly on time. Overall a very good experience in terms of the service team."
3/5/18,4,I also own an Audi and have just had a MOt completed there last week - they always wash and vacuum the car unlike Mercedes and its cheaper with Audi.
3/5/18,4,"Great service and engagement from the Team both during the purchase and handover of our vehicle with specific thanks to Mick, Nick and Andy. They were friendly, passionate and patient with us and did the basics right. Issues with Mercedes Benz finance system on the day of the collection of the car was the only ""blot"" on an otherwise great experience. Thanks!"
3/5/18,5,"The staff at Cooper Mini in Thames Ditton were excellent. The sales approach was professional and forthright and I am happy with my new car and the deal we negotiated. Well done!

I did not know before, that Thames Ditton was the original location where Mini Coopers were produced, although one could have guessed this from the company name ""Cooper Mini"". The site, unlike its great staff is, however, really poor. If I ran Inchcape, I would spend the money to make this a Mini Cooper flagship store!"
3/5/18,5,Very good service the salesman was excellent and was very knowledgeable David randles
3/5/18,5,"RELIABLE, professional and friendly.
Very good job done of Service and MOT.
Despite the bad weather (snow etc) still managed
to clean the car!!
Great value all round - thanks to all the team."
3/5/18,5,"Couldn’t fault the service from Charlotte and Grace. They made exchanging & buying a new car so easy for me.

Thank you both so much."
3/5/18,5,"My sales advisor Glen Mcmillan was extremely helpful and informative from the designing of my new Mini through to the collection day. He kept me informed at all the stages providing excellent customer services. I am very happy with my Mini, it’s a fantastic car, drives well and looks fabulous.
Jade"
3/5/18,5,All worked well in difficult weather conditions. Garage closed early on the day of the work but that was understandable in the bad weather and the car could be collected the following day. All work as described plus warnings of potential future issues.
3/5/18,1,"Would have been higher only car went in for a service and a few days earlier I was getting a warning that the battery in my key was getting low. Naturally I though they might replace it but no apparently not so had to but one. Though it’s not a big thing I pay for a service plan which this includes.

Also didn’t appreciate having to argue with the service receptionist about what is and isn’t included in my service plan. I have a book and it states in black and white that one aircon service is included in my plan. Only to be told we’ll have to ask VW. For someone who works for a main dealer in service I would expect them to know what is included instead of making customer feel like a cheat or liar.

Edited to add

Car returned to complete the work that you failed to complete first time around, when I got the car back a number of items were missing from my car. Called and spoke to somebody to be given the brush off that they can't take responsibility for personal property left in vehicles. Am frankly appalled by this, I put my trust in you and gave you my business and you repay this me betraying my trust and stealing from me!"
3/5/18,5,Always a good service.
3/4/18,5,"We dealt with sam and he was fantastic with helping us throughout buying car we wanted. He was Very polite, answered all our questions and we were very happy with maidstone audi would highly recommend them"
3/4/18,5,Brilliant service. I have been using Inchcape for the past 7 years & wouldn't go anywhere else.
3/4/18,5,A very good service from James Yeomans
3/4/18,1,"Initially finding the spec of the model I liked was made very easy by the sales person. He took me thro the computer program which listed all available models with a multitude of specs, finally allowing me to pick the particular one solely based on colour. Delivery date was decided and the rest happened to achieve this date. Delivery day was very straight forward with everything you would expect, and I drove off into the sunset, sorry into the first winter weather this country has had for many years."
3/4/18,5,"Good service.
Great people
High quality work"
3/3/18,5,"Brilliant service top salesman named mo
10/10 coffee gets 10 to"
3/3/18,1,"I've stopped using Inchcape due to the poor service but decided to give them another go. My car was booked in for a fault with the central locking. I left it with them all day, and was called to confirm it was ready to collect. When I picked it up they said they couldn't replicate the problem so nothing had been done. Interestingly when I went out to the car to take it home, the problem was still there ... and I had no problem replicating it!!

The staff are pleasant enough but it seems that if they plug it into the diagnostics computer and it doesn't highlight the issue then it doesn't exist. So I had had to take a full day off work to get my car into the garage for a wasted trip. This isn't the first time this has happened either - I had 3 similar ""we can't find a problem"" visits for a faulty clutch before it was finally replaced. So my car is booked in again next week - lets hope it gets sorted this time.

In addition their service costs over £100 more than other Land Rover dealers in the Lancashire area so shop around!!!!!"
3/3/18,5,"Was taken care of by Suffyan, helped us out so much 1st class service will defo go back and buy another car from him thankyou"
3/3/18,5,"Amy Stickley was amazing. Nothing too much trouble, everything was clear and precise st the ordering stage. A true professional.

Disappointed with the weblink not working at home (which apparently some staff knew it could be a problem). This culminated in us not being able to collect the car at the time we requested - the link had to be accessed at the Audi showroom. Also a message was not passed on within the finance team.

Other than that a great experience. You need to employ more staff like Amy."
3/3/18,5,"Just had my car serviced and M.O.T’d. at Sanhurst Toyota Garage. Excellent service. They even picked up and returned my car in snowy conditions! Feedback from them was great. Well done and thank you.

Ursula Hancock"
3/3/18,3,"The process for booking the car in was fine.
Had to wait a while to be seen and explain the issues we had regarding the roof rack. Then had to go out to the car twice, in the freezing cold, to explain the roof rack issue and then again for a video of the car to be taken for dents etc.
We asked for a set of car mats to be quoted and fitted.
We were told the ad blue would be topped up.
When it came to collecting the car we had to wait while the issue of the roof rack was once again discussed and then we were told that we'd have to bring the car back in for a new one to be fitted. This should have been indicated to us when the service was done so we didn't have to make the journey twice. It seems the roof rack issue was only addressed when we came back in to collect the car not when we'd requested it. We were told we'd be called when the new part was in but still haven't heard anything.
Then the quote for the mats had not been done. That took another 10 minutes then they had to be found and paid for.
.
The car was handed back ""cleaned"" but was very unsatisfactory. There was still alot of mud on the car outside and inside. No ad blue had been added as promised.

The actual servicing was fine but everything else was a shambles."
3/3/18,5,"Great experience, they looked after my purchase from start to finish. Recommended"
3/3/18,5,Fantastic customer service from all at Derby and fantastic car. Thank you all for your help and assistance in choosing the car.
3/3/18,1,I had my car serviced at BMW in Cobham. After the service (which I waited an hour and 15-mins longer than I was initially told) I was notified by the technician's video that I had a cracked alloy wheel. I rang them and ordered this. Not wanting to have a wasted journey I asked the staff member to confirm that the wheel ordered was dark grey to match the existing wheels. I had little confidence with whom I was dealing with as he had already made a mistake initially letting me know that the service cost was covered under my service package only then to find out that it was not and then I was subsequently charged. For the second time I asked him to confirm that the wheel he ordered was dark grey and he confirmed. Today I made the journey back again only to find out that the wheel was silver. Total incompetence means that I have to make another journey back there to get this done. The service area is littered with positive service messages - shame I was let down on so many occasions in such a short space of time.
3/3/18,5,Straight forward. Naomi was very helpfull and pleasant.
3/3/18,5,Fantastic reliable service as always.
3/3/18,4,"price wise I am not very setspite , sales services ok what not 100 percent , there is some thing missing , what I cant blame any body for this , I got 6 car in the family,every agency sales man all same , in every car show room so ok"
3/3/18,5,Very happy with the service we received and would recommend this dealer to friends and family
3/3/18,5,"Car in for a service.
Very friendly and courteous staff. I was kept informed during the day on the progress.
Car had been washed and was ready on time.
Thank you"
3/3/18,5,"Always a great service when ever I visit this or any Mercedes garage,"
3/3/18,5,"Amazing
Beckie is honestly the one to deal with, she’s so helpful, full of knowledge, literally makes the whole buying a new car experience one to remember, nothing is too much trouble, she’s just so lovely
An absolute credit to the company!!"
3/2/18,5,As is usual just a great experience
3/2/18,4,Car Service finished one and half hours before being notified.....a lot of unnecessary time sat waiting in lounge area. Apologies made and accepted but not great service. Free car clean not done very well.
3/2/18,5,"Bought a used Audi A1 last week from this company and were superb from the moment we walked in to the minute we drove off with the car.
Salesman Lee Evans was very informative and helpful and passed on lots of good advice.
Would highly recommend !!!"
3/2/18,1,Thief’s and liars
3/2/18,5,Awesome service! 😁
3/2/18,5,"Everything from order to collection was exceptional in every way! I would advise anyone who is looking for an Audi or any other prestige car to go to Cheshire Oaks Audi and simply ask for Gavin the manager there. Truly unbeatable. Personal, attentive and they really listen to your needs and to them small things that make your car yours!"
3/2/18,5,Excellent service
3/2/18,5,Always helpful
3/2/18,5,So happy with my new purchase of an Audi Q2. On collection Hannah was really welcoming and helpful she took her time going over the paperwork with me and sat in the car to go through everything. Hannah also said that I could call or email anytime with questions and she would happily go through anything with me. On arrival the receptionist was very friendly. Overall a very good experience and would definitely recommend. Many thanks
3/2/18,1,"We have purchased many cars from this dealership however we have always found the service substandard and not inline with the luxury brand. Our experience yesterday however was the final straw, one of our cars was recalled for a fault so we made an appointment and even though we arrived 15 minutes late due to the bad weather they still weren't ready to see us and we had to wait 15 minutes for them to get the paperwork. We had our 6 month old baby with us so I said I would come back for the car rather than waiting. It was agreed for a 3pm collection but they would message when it was ready which they did arou d 1pm. I got a taxi again with my daughter under the impression it would be a quick collection so I hadn't taken the baby bag with me. The woman on reception told me when I arrived that the service team were in a meeting and I would have to wait 'quite a few minutes' I explained I had to get my daughter home but she said there was nothing she could do. A 45 minute wait later the service team emerged and my vehicle was brought round. There was at least 8 people waiting to be seen either in the waiting room or in the showroom. Along with the fact the weather and driving conditions were dangerous and I had a baby with me I thought that they would have dealt with me quickly and showed some compassion but that was not the case. This dealership needs to understand that the customer comes first, meetings should be done before opening or after closing and if they need to be done in trading hours then at least one person should be left out to deal with customers. Our family will be going elsewhere for our purchases and services in the future."
3/2/18,4,"Usual friendly and efficient service despite the snowy conditions.
Small complaint when replacement wipers did not clear the screen - critical in prevailing conditions. Soon sorted out and replaced."
3/2/18,5,Great service and help from Steve and Bobby. Everyone was very friendly and made the experience of buying my new car thoroughly enjoyable. They even went out of their way to pick me up to bring me to the dealership when I collected my car. Thank you.
3/2/18,4,"Matteo was a great sales man. Patient, interested in us as client and not the classic male chauvinist you experience in most up market dealerships."
3/2/18,5,"Excellent service in re- arranging my booking to the collection and delivery service also provided.
A very efficient service."
3/2/18,5,Excellent customer service
3/2/18,5,"They managed to get a courtesy car in line with my next possible purchase.
An unexpected extra part was needed to complete the service. They managed to rush the part through to avoid an extra return visit to the dealership.
Very professional"
3/2/18,5,"The car's first service was excellent. The Service Team were able to arrange for it to be done on the best date for me. Although the weather was very poor, the car was picked up on time and I was impressed with the video check sent by e-mail. Well done!!"
3/2/18,1,The customer service at this branch is terrible and poor. Avoid using this place as there are other available options nearby. I own a car which is less then 3 years old and I expected a premium service from a premium brand. I suggest the management to invest on training staff on how to build customer relationship in order for clients to come back. After 2 bad experiences I definitely won't be returning again even though it being the closest branch to my place of residence.
3/2/18,5,"Our Lexus RH450 was exactly as ordered and looked immaculate.Great care taken to explain how everything operated with the promise of follow up advise if needed.Met all the team that we would be dealing with for maintenance etc.Potential extra insurance for wheels/tyres, paint scratches and GAP explained without pressure to buy.Supplied with a full tank of fuel and the gifts of flowers etc were much appreciated."
3/2/18,5,"Amy was very competent and friendly, we are fully satisfied."
3/2/18,5,"This is my second car from Inchscape...a superb service first time round, hence my second visit.
This time the welcome I received was equally if not more encouraging, the staff as always courteous, helpful and friendly.
My special thanks to Emile Hopkins who made my selection; collection and overall experience
a delight. I look forward to a hopefully long and pleasant association with Inchscape of Loughborough, Leicestershire."
3/2/18,5,"Great service to my car , car was valeted and all service work carried out in few hours at a very good price, highly recommend inchcape Chester Volkswagen"

3/2/18,5,"Purchase of new car.
We found Neil Cameron to be friendly, professional and very informative in helping us to choose our new car.He maintained contact with us on a weekly basis via video link to keep us informed of the cars status,from order being accepted by manufacturer right through to delivery to Macclesfield Audi.
Neil took great care to explain all the technology etc when we collected the car yesterday,and has offered more help in the future if required.
We have always been very satisfied with the customer service at Macclesfield Audi in all departments we have visited."
3/2/18,5,Efficient customer service
3/2/18,4,The sales assistant was very pleasant & helpful. The reception area was pleasant. The only problem is getting hold of the staff by phone as messages left are not passed on.
3/2/18,5,"Very helpful staff, very informative and efficient service"
3/2/18,5,5 Series in for MOT was easy straight forward and no issues. The staff were pleasant and welcoming and accommodated my arrival and collection requirements without question. Car was presented washed and clean with a video of the complimentary condition check sent by text - very impressed.
3/2/18,5,Amazing service. Really really happy. Ellis was really helpful. Recommend!
3/2/18,5,I could not fault the service I received from Huw Evans when buying my new car. Nothing was too much trouble and he genuinely wanted me to be happy with my purchase. He was knowledgeable about the different models of cars and offered good advice. I am delighted with my B180 Exclusive Plus car. Thank you
3/2/18,4,"A good understanding of my requirements and competitive on price.
Staff were polite at the point of sale.
At collection I felt invisible on entering the showroom despite the presence of employees. I ended up waiting around 10 minutes.
The vehicle was not ready at the stated time which was disappointing as the company had plenty of notice regarding my collection.
The handover took place in the snow, an interior area would have been more professional.
A fault on the bodywork identified before collection but only notified to me after I left the showroom has resulted in having to return the vehicle.
I love the vehicle!"
3/2/18,5,"My first experience with Audi Inchcape UK (Swindon).
Myself and my wife felt very welcome and were impressed with the attention we received that day.
Can't fault the team at all, very professional and attenative to detail.
Would recommend Inchcape to my friends and family.

3/2/18,4,"The service by Mercedes of Leicester was outstanding, as usual, but the major problem was with communicating with that branch. There appears to be a centralised phone/call centre which failed to call back when promised and which lacked the friendly personal touch I am used to. Moreover, there was a confusion over telephone numbers which caused me to think that this particular branch had gone out of business, so I had my car MoT's elsewhere. It was only after a call to my wife, about her car, that we realised the branch was still there, fortunately. Top marks to the great, efficient and friendly service from Mercedes of Leicester."
3/2/18,5,"First service for our Golf. Booked through the VW App, done on time, courtesy car supplied. Very courteous and efficient staff and car was ready exactly on time as promised. Very happy to use Inchcape and recommend them."
3/2/18,5,"The staff at Cooper Mini Tonbridge were efficient, warm and friendly, while the job was completed on time and at a high standard. So I am very happy and will readily recommend this outlet."
3/2/18,5,Thank you to the team at Toyota Nottingham. Bought a new car for my daughter and they couldn't do enough for me. Any niggles were worked out without inconveniencing me but especially impressed that they noticed they had a registration number with my daughter's initials on it. The difference between just selling a car and making it a memorable experience is what matters. Thank you to all the team for making the experience something to remember.
3/2/18,1,"I was pretty shocked with the lack of customer service shown by Mercedes Benz when I took my car in. My vehicle was recalled due to a faulty airbag and had to inconvenience me on a morning I had booked off before work. I took my vehicle in at 9am for the fault to be fixed. I left my vehicle with Mercedes all day and was not offered anything to compensate my inconvenience. My car was not cleaned I was not comoplimented with anything and not even issued with an apology. After previously being a VW owner I had unbelievable customer service off them when my last vehicle was recalled. They cleaned my car top to bottom and even offered me a service and a bottle of Moët to apologise for the issue. This was the service I was expecting from Mercedes however this did not show. The service technicians performance was good however everyone else’s was utterly shocking and I hope this changes in the future.


Kind regards

Ben"
3/2/18,4,Kezandra was very pleasant and courteous. Took a while to find my way into the free Wi-fi offered while I waited on site for the Ad-Blue to be topped up and courtesy check to be completed. The paperwork says Audi will price match any tyres needed but apparently they no longer offer that. Would have helped while I was a captive audience but their price was £40 per tyre above what I'd been quoted.
3/2/18,5,A refreshing hassle free and professional experience.
3/2/18,5,"I have always received the most amazing service from the guys at Crawley Audi, something that I haven't experienced from other dealers. Mo had set very high standards when I bought my first Audi 2 years ago but Ellis did not disappoint! Friendly, helpful, patient and genuinely a lovely guy. Another very happy customer!"
3/2/18,5,"Very happy with the service I received from Inchcape Toyota in Guildford when buying my new car. I would recommend them, have now used them several times with good service."
3/2/18,4,"Friendly, efficient and courteous service.
Everything completed on time and as quoted."
3/2/18,5,"Picked my car up from home as not to disrupt my working day, dropped it back off also after I had got home so i was not waiting around. Also fixed a parking sensor free of charge where other garages would have charged me. Very friendly staff who explained everything to me. Many thanks"
3/2/18,5,Always great service!
3/1/18,5,Excellent service yet again hyde audi .couldn't have done anymore.
3/1/18,5,Excellent service
3/1/18,5,"A pleasure the salesman did everything for me and knew exactly what I wanted. Very pleased with the whole process and very, very, pleased with car. Thank you Gerald Klassa"
3/1/18,5,It was the day of the big snow but the team coped well and were able to get all the work scheduled completed plus some extras. James was very professional in making all the arrangements.
3/1/18,5,"Being a little wary that the sales staff we have dealt with for the past 20 years were no longer at Mercedes Leicester, we were delighted to meet Denil. He was extremely helpful, friendly yet professional. The perfect combination and he managed to find us the vehicle we were looking for.
The coffee was good too!
Would not hesitate to recommend purchasing through Denil at Mercedes Leicester - hope he remains our contact for many years to come."
3/1/18,5,"Booking was easy. Martin Lord was accurate in his estimate of how long the job would take.
I trust a Mercedes dealer to do the job requested which, otherwise, has no tangible evidence of having been done (changing gearbox oil)
I got a comprehensive condition report, including a video, with quotes for other work required. Very helpful!
All the people I came into contact with were very pleasant and helpful.
Only two small negatives:
the viewing window from the showroom to the workshop, which I really liked, has been removed since the last time I paid a visit.
And a car wash would have been nice but there was a blizzard blowing."
3/1/18,5,The service at the dealership was excellent and could not be faulted.
3/1/18,2,"Took my Range Rover Evoke in for its 3rd annual service and MOT at Hunters Derby, which is the garage from where I purchased the vehicle from new and where it had its previous two annual services . I was told that everything was ok. Just 5 months and 4 thousand miles later my rear brake pads was worn down to the metal which caused damage to the discs as well. The service record indicated that 40% and 50% brake lining wear was left on the rear and front brakes respectively so considered that the brake pads would not want changing until its 4th service. This assumption was made because of my very low annual mileage. I had only covered 24,000 miles on its 3rd service so I think this assumption was quite reasonable. Purely because of distances involved I had the rear brake and discs renewed at a more local garage. To my horror I was told that the front pads only had about a 1,000 mile left so I had these replaced as well. On contacting hunters they offered no apology and stated there was no exact science in calculating remaining brake lining. Surely an experienced and professional technician should know how worn brake linings are and advise the customer accordingly.
There was obviously less than the stated % left on the brake linings at the time of its 3rd service which put my and other road users safety at risk.
I am now taking my vehicle to an alternative landrover dealership and would not recommend Hunters of Derby to anyone as I do not trust them."
3/1/18,5,David Rubin set up my purchase but was not able to do the handover today. David has been a great ambassador for Mercedes and I believe that I've got a great deal. David did let me know that he wouldn't be able to see me today and informed me that he had briefed Tom to look after me instead. Tom was very personable and knowledgeable. He completed the handover with the minimum of fuss and in a very professional manner. The whole process from ordering to handover has been straightforward and a pleasure.
3/1/18,5,Returning to Audi after 30 years and the experience at Audi Crawley was simply outstanding from initial contact through to collection.
3/1/18,5,"Our van went in for repairs, and we dealt with Claire in the service department. We were given honest answers, she kept us updated
with what was happening and how long things were taking.
she did the best job and keeping everything calm and under control
Thank you so much for all your help

Russ Walsh."
3/1/18,5,"Annual service and MOT. Car collected at a convenient time in spite of the bad weather, the driver discussed when it had to be returned, and later, after a quick call to inform me that it's passed the test and collect the payment I got the perfectly cleaned car back before the agreed time. Also - as a part of the free health check - received an email with a video clearly showing what will need attention soon. Excellent service."
3/1/18,5,"I have absolutely no complaints at all about my recent visit to the Southampton showroom, everything was excellent.
The things I do have a complaint about are :-
These questionnaires, if something is wrong I'll say about it at the time. It is getting really annoying that almost everything you get of late requires a questionnaire, from getting my haircut to getting my car serviced, plus everything in between.
I also don't like and won't use the centralised booking system. I have used your servicing dept. in Southampton for more than 25 years, I know Paul and Gabby on the servicing desk personally and always get excellent help and attention from them, rather than some unknown faceless person somewhere in Britain I know not where.
Tony Nutley"
3/1/18,4,Great service from Vicky in sales who tried her best to deliver a positive customer experience.However an area for improvement is in the cleaning and preparation of the vehicle. The vehicle was not ready on the day. I was made to wait a long time and even when vehicle was picked up the interior was not cleaned to an acceptable standard.
3/1/18,5,"Stephen helped me get my car sorted, talked me through everything, it was great customer service, he knew I was really nervous drop my it home in the snow and not drive a Automatic before, he very kindly drove it while I watched and showed me what to do which I fully appreciate.
You can’t get no better service than at BMW Teesside"
3/1/18,5,"Colin and the team at Land Rover York are always helpful. This time, apart from the work being completed to time with valuable comprehensive healthcheck (videod), in the apalling snowy conditions, I was returned home and collected when my vehicle was ready. First class service in my opinion."
3/1/18,5,"This is our first service with Inchcape UK and we cannot fault them. Even though the weather was against us and them, they still arrived for the collection of our car as planned. Even more surprising was they delivered the car back to us after servicing , from Preston, at around 15:00. This means , in total they had the car for five hours and that includes taking to Preston and back, which is around an hour and a quarter in itself .. plus washing and servicing ... Never got this speed of service from previous companies ... well done H A FOX of Preston"
3/1/18,3,"I booked via the central team and reserved a space on the car service into town after dropping off the car. My wife took the car in for me. She waited 10 minutes outside whilst everyone drank tea in the warmth because she arrived early. Open the doors guys! She was then spoken to rudely by the guy providing the lifts into town as she had ‘not reserved a place’, which was incorrect. She was told I would be contacted by the service centre about future payment offers and also how to update my sat nav. Well, I received a call but no mention of either item.

It isn’t difficult to offer good or excellent customer service. All of the above, whilst minor points, just add up to leave a rather disappointing experience of the whole team. And it is so easy to get it right.."
3/1/18,3,Felt my concerns were'nt being taken seriously and that a problem i'm experiencing with my car and the fact it's under warranty doesn't bring in any money for VW. I have to say that having bought a brand new car i expect everything to work perfectly.
3/1/18,5,Polite receptionists on arrival. Up to date information on the cars progress when it was in for its MOT. I enjoyed the video I was sent afterwards which showed under the car during the inspection.
3/1/18,5,Excellent Service
3/1/18,4,"Am very annoyed Toyota got my name wrong.
It should be LAM, not LAMM."
3/1/18,5,Very helpful and friendly service. Thanks
3/1/18,5,"Inchape provided me a very good service whilst I had the cambelt changed on my vehicle. Whilst never a cheap job, the blow was softened by having the car check carried out, and a video produced showing potential issues.

All in all, I was very pleased with the service received."
3/1/18,5,Really good service and went above and beyond to help complete the sale.
3/1/18,5,"Always excellent service , quick and easy booking process with all works completed as promised . A real shame to hear Paul Martins is departing for another BMW dealer , he is with out doubt the best service manager I know having looked after my cars for many years ."
3/1/18,2,"Did not have a courtesy car after i booked my service more than a month in advance, after confirminng with mercedes my courtesy car would be available the day before my service. I arrived and got told there was no courtesy car available."
3/1/18,5,"Excellent efficient service Dane went over and above in difficult dealership conditions to make everything go as smoothly as possible.
Thanks to Gareth and Dane for the swift turn around xx"
3/1/18,5,"Excellent service. Polite, patient and efficient. Knowledgeable about the car and it’s functions."
3/1/18,5,"Even at the point of arrival, staff were helpful and friendly. Having opted to wait for the service to be completed, I was spoken to in an amicable way and when my car was ready even the service video was presented in a way that you can see what was going on, without a whole lot of jargon!
Bought a service plan, very pleased with their whole attitude to me as a customer."
3/1/18,5,Excellent service
3/1/18,5,"Always treated as though I am important. Efficient, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. Outstanding VW dealership with superb staff. Thank you Inchcape Swindon."
3/1/18,5,Great service Charlie Elliott took great care of us through the whole buying process. took delivery of our new mini yesterday even when the weather was at its worse. 100% good service.
3/1/18,5,"Excellent customer service from the minute you walk through the door, the reception staff greet you with a smile, guide you to a seat while the service advisor prepares the paperwork. A coffee is provided and the booking in of the car is complete, I was given a lift home. During the morning I received a short video from the technician working on my car. I later received a phone call from my service advisor going over the service carried out, payment was taken and the car was delivered back to me. First class service all round, I recommend this dealership every chance I get, I know two friends who have bought Audi on my recommendation."
3/1/18,5,Excellent customer service
3/1/18,3,"I have used VW Altrincham for many years to service my vehicles. I have no issue with the facility or staff who are always friendly.
Yesterday (28/2/18) when I collected my Touareg, following a service, I noted a box on my passenger seat and a note that informed me that a 'data plug' had been fitted to my vehicle 'absolutely free of charge' usual cost £40. I was not informed when I dropped off my vehicle that this would be done, nor informed on collection that it had been done. Do i wish VW to fit a data capture device to my vehicle? NO. Will I be registering the device and using the App? NO. Should I have been informed of the intention to fit it? YES.
Not happy with this unnecessary and intrusive device being fitted to my vehicle without my prior consent."
3/1/18,5,Saw the car I wanted and was helped all the way along the line through the process by Joe Forster who was both helpful and courteous. By far and away the best car buying experience I’ve ever had and I would recommend East Kent Audi unreservedly. Their product is pure quality only matched by their staff and I now look forwards to continuing this good relationship through the service and aftercare experience.
3/1/18,5,"I was greeted by a very friendly and efficient lady, who sorted my paperwork out. My car was returned complete with a full report on the work carried out. They had listened to my concerns and these were all checked on the report too. Excellent customer service."
3/1/18,5,Very helpful and lovely staff can’t do enough for you
3/1/18,5,"Great service, highly professional, a Pluto deal with."
3/1/18,4,"The Maidstone Audi centre is a superb facility. More important was the friendly and expert service provided. Only negative is the phone system. On three occasions when there was no answer, you are told there is no one to take your call and the line goes dead. Quite poor customer service in that area. I have written to the General Manager about it. So only four stars as a result."
3/1/18,5,Excellent service friendly and professional
3/1/18,5,Very friendly and professional service.
3/1/18,1,Courtsey car had no fuel in it car was rotten. On return to collect my I didn’t receive a health check or citnow video I was then given my keys to a dirty car and two error messages on the dash of my car an to top it off there was a dint in my passenger side door terrible customer service and wouldn’t recommend Warrington Mercedes to anybody

2/28/18,4,This would be a 5 star review were it not for the parking issue that always exists at Cobham. The staff are really good - everything was perfect. The service manager even went out in the snow to get my car out of a congested car park. They are really great people delivering top service!
2/28/18,4,Quick efficient customer service
2/28/18,5,"First time purchase of an Audi and simply the best experience of buying a car I've ever had. Seamless from beginning to end, very clear, open, honest, collaborative and helpful - brilliant all round."
2/28/18,5,"We purchased a mini for our son as a first car, he was very specific about his requirements as he had saved very hard for his first set of wheels , Adam at Cooper Mini Ipswich listened to what he wanted and delivered within budget, from start to finish this was a pleasant experience and when the car was delivered to us in Nottingham yesterday he was delighted. Thank you Adam and Cooper Mini Ipswich.
Alison, David and Brennan Johnson."
2/28/18,5,"I received immediate service when I called in on the off chance!. Every time I ask for help from ‘Cooper Cobham’ it is always available. Helpful, kind and professional staff, Thank you."

2/28/18,1,"I expressed interest in once of the used BMW x1 and Darren sent me a followup email. I called him on Tuesday the 20th of Feb at 14:19 telling him we will be there at the location to test drive the car. To our surprise, he was not around when we came in on Saturday which was not that big of a shock than the fact that the car we expressed interest in had been already booked on Thursday the 22nd and we were not told of the same. I drove my pregnant wife all the way from Biggleswade to be subjected to this terrible experience. Can you please make sure this does not happen to other people in the future. I know it will not matter to you, but I thought to let you know we will not be dealing with Cooper again and definitely not the one in Chelmsford and also that we booked a BMW the next day with Barons in Cambridge."
2/28/18,5,VERY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE.
2/28/18,5,"I was very happy with this service. The cost was as predicted, and reasonably priced for a 40,000 mile service, and I was kept fully in the picture by my very courteous Service Advisor, Piotr Kasprzak. A replacement car was provided for the day, and the car was ready on time."
2/28/18,5,"My recent experience with BMW was excellent. Two new tyres at a very reasonable cost. Valet & car health check free. Also cleaning of windscreen washer at no charge. Staff couldn't have been more helpful, even tuning in my radio. One very happy customer."
2/28/18,5,"Very prompt & efficient service, on the phone and in person.
Excellent facilities."
2/28/18,5,"Easy booking process.
Service personnel & driver to get me to/from my onward destination were ready to receive me & did so in a friendly manner.
Information regarding progress was offered promptly.
Car cleaned ready for collection"
2/28/18,4,"Mercedes offer a quality service, it is all very efficient. The only negative is they always seem to need the car for a long time, I am always surprised that it takes 2 hours to update the GPS."
2/28/18,5,Excellent service.
2/28/18,5,Purchased an approved BMW X1. It needed a few bits sorting out which the salesman organised for me through the service department. The work was done quickly and efficiently. As a result the car is in tip top condition and drives like new. Very pleased with the service.
2/28/18,5,Very impressed with Cooper Durham. Nigel Carr was very professional throughout the process and made the experience of buying a used car hassle free. Would definitely recommend this company to anyone.

2/28/18,5,Great service and very efficient!
2/28/18,5,Great Service - enjoyed the video walk through of the Car :)
2/27/18,5,"As always, good customer service."
2/27/18,1,"Salesman (Craig) was very helpful, but the whole experience was let down by appalling after sales service in respect of cash back payment. 10 calls, 2 emails and a tweet later, money was finally received.
Despite speaking to complaints dept, not a hint of a formal apology...seemingly once they have your signature and money, they don’t care about anything else.
Car is nice though!"
2/27/18,5,"Excellent service as always,
Definitely recommend Lexus to anyone."
2/27/18,1,"I have had three dealings with Inchcape Mercedes nottingham.
1. Service on A160 vehicle returned with parts of service not undertaken e.g. wipers totally inadequste expected at least advisory. Returned vehicle couldn’t appologise enough but did nothing.
2. 2004 brand new B200 wrong fuelled £4000.00 bill left vehicle while went away for 3 weeks. Not ready on return. When I picked the car up I did’nt even get of the dealers plot- black smoke engine misfiring. Returned to workshop still had petrol in fuel lines therefore re-contaminated all seals etc Dealers response it should be ok now!
3. New vehicle purchase went through specs several times to include exec pack and 360deg cameras to aid my wife because of difficulty turning with the “Motability expert” agreed price test drove vehicle agreed price on our smart car. Paperwork completed with additional requirements written on order form.
Whin I contacted the sales exec to arrange delivery of the Smart to the dealer he said “oh I am glad you phoned” then proceeded to tel me that they could not supply the 360 cameras without an additional cost of £1600-00 my complaint was escalated to the sales manager. At their head office who’s only comment was tha mistakes happen and they would not install the cameras without a cost of £330 for the cameras and a further £1695-00 for the premier package.
I would appear that this dealer is quite apt at making mistakes at the customers expense.
Not what I would expect from a premier brand dealer,"
2/27/18,5,good experience
2/27/18,1,"Me and my wife recently went to Cooper BMW to look at purchasing a 3 series X Drive.

After finding what we thought was a good deal we decided to proceed with the purchase and put a £1000 deposit to secure the car

Unfortunate for us personal circumstances meant we needed to pull out of the purchase, and push back our plans of purchasing a car from Coopers BMW.

Once we emailed Cooper BMW Croydon of our intention to pull out and request our deposit back we were thrown jargon and stories why we could not have it back.

The experience with Cooper has been a stressful one and we are still taking up our demand with the CEO of Inchcape to get our deposit back

Steer clear of this franchise and dealership, they like to use confusion and tricks to rob their customers"

2/26/18,5,excellent service car came back spotless and all work completed would recommend
2/26/18,4,"As a regular customer for vehicle servicing I took advantage of their MOT offer. Liked their video of them inspecting my car and their report document highlighting items requiring attention - useful.
I was supposed to meet the sales manager to discuss a new Golf estate but he wasn't there so Kerri Holder gave me details and a quotation.
As I was collecting my car anyway it wasted little time.
Summarising: Service Dept. Excellent
Sales Dept. I've seen better elsewhere."

2/25/18,5,"VW Altrincham have just carried out the first service on my Tiguan. The booking process, the service itself and the after-care contact were exemplary. The efficient, friendly staff at every stage made the whole experience run like clockwork.

The post-service video report was a particularly notable element.

I have been a customer for some years now. i have never been disappointed."
2/25/18,1,"First I have to say the Parts Department staff,Technicians,Service Advisors Faith and Claire are all very good.
My problems have been with salesmen and management, salesman not informing me my 4month wait for my new car was now a 10month wait, failing to inform me my car had arrived, failing to order parts which he said he was going to do when I first ordered my car and kept insisting I still owed money when I had paid in full,I could not resolve this with him so I ask to see his manager, he agreed I had paid in full and he had not kept me informed about my 10month wait only then to treat me with contempt by telling me that to be fair to the salesman that I had ordered a lot of extras.Selling me Cosmetic Minor Repair Protection only to find out it excludes my car MINERAL WHITE making it worthless, then registering me with BMW as having BMW Service Inclusive cost £425 and not having what I paid for BMW Service Inclusive Plus cost £1370.
I have Email the Aftersales Director as he adversities that if you are not satisfied with the service to contact him directly, so far no reply.
WARNING PEOPLE MAKE SURE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
I bought my BMWX3 in good faith and expected get what I paid for so for me Cooper Norwich falls short of the high standards they claim to have and from my experiences it not only damages there reputation but also the brand."
2/25/18,1,Car was supposed to be ready after a service at 4pm. I had to call them at 4:10 while on my way to only find out that my car won't be ready till 5-5:30. Needed to pick up my daughter then so I told them I would get it in the morning. Picked up my Car and took it to Kwik fit for a MOT. Kwik fit failed it due to a brake cable being twisted and one wheel nut missing. Bought the car from them a year ago so no one else has touched the car since then. Took it back to them and they tried to get out of it saying the brakes look new so it must be someone else. They did replace the wheel nut and did a MOT there. To say sorry they gave me a £8 bottle of Jacobs Creek wine which was off when we opened it!!! never going to them again. Both cars are VW and if it comes to it ill sell them and get another brand to avoid using Inchape Romford again. Absolute Shambles!!
2/25/18,5,"Graham Tozer of Banstead branch was outstanding today. He explained to me why a light on my dashboard was appearing and that I didn’t need the investigation that I was about to pay for. In my opinion this is a kind and honest thing to do. I’ve dealt with Graham in the past and he’s always been brilliant. He is a friendly member of the team, always very helpful and will go the extra mile. Thank you Graham!"
2/25/18,5,"Great service experience. Refreshments and somewhere to work with wifi whilst I waited. Service a couple of hours, including car clean."
2/25/18,4,"Upon arriving at 8:30am, a friendly welcome from Gabrielle awaited, who double checked what was happening to my car and ran through the courtesy car paperwork. I collected my brand new XF courtesy car from the car park. The whole experience was fast and efficient. I was a little disappointed that my cars service did not seem to be undertaken until at least 16:30 as a couple minor faults were discovered, but it is was not able to be resolved that day, and my car would have had to remain at H A Fox over night.
Despite this minor point, my experience was of a friendly, efficient dealership."
2/25/18,5,First class experience from an AMG customer perspective. Very helpful and the hand over experience was first class. Would definitely recommended dealing with Ashley!
2/24/18,2,"We bought a brand new A43 from Inchcape Oxford. The car was delayed and we were not told until the day before, once we had made all the arrangements to have the old one off the road. When the car arrived, we had made another payment so the settlement figure was wrong and we were owed over £600. To cut a long story short, it took over two weeks, many phone calls and me getting very cross before it was eventually resolved. They never answer their phones and don't seem to be able to offer the service you would expect from a main dealer. It was our second car from them (the first one also delivered late) and it will certainly be our last."
2/24/18,5,"Excellent customer service by Julian made to feel very welcome and made my daughter feel special in purchasing her Q2 .

Thank you"
2/24/18,4,"I took my Golf into the garage for its first service. I had not used this garage before. There were wide parking spaces giving me some confidence that if a car door next to me was opened, there was less chance of it hitting my car. The reception staff were very polite and friendly and all appeared efficient. I was told that in addition to the service my car was part of a recall needing a braking sensor to be replaced. As promised, I was telephoned when the car was ready and all appeared well. I was impressed with everything up to this point. However, a problem arose. My wife had driven the car home whilst I drove in another car. When we arrived home, my wife switched off the engine and attempted to leave the car but it was on a slight slope and it started to roll backwards. Fortunately,she was able to get her foot back on the brake pedal and stop the car rolling before it could hit something. She then told me that she had not had Auto Hold support throughout her journey and she did not know how to solve it. I secured the car and then phoned the garage, believing that there was a fault with the brakes. I was told that there was no actual fault but that the Auto Hold had not been switched on at the beginning of the journey. An electric brake and Auto Hold were new to us. I had set Auto Hold a year ago and we just leave it on permanently and so we would not check to see if it were switched on. This incident was potentially very dangerous and it was lucky that my wife's journey home did not require her to stop on any hills with vehicles close behind her. In my opinion the garage should have noted the position of the Auto Hold when starting the work and should have put it back into the same position when the work was done. As a result of reporting this situation to the garage, I sincerely hope that they will now make it a permanent part of their practice to either return the Auto Hold to the position it was in on arrival at the garage, or, at least, inform a customer, upon collection, that the Auto Hold had been switched off and needed to be switched back on, if desired."
2/24/18,4,Would be 5 Stars just finding a parking spot is the problem at this site hope the planed move will eliminate this small problem
2/24/18,1,"1/ Service manager addressed me as ‘Buddy’ instead of ‘Sir’ which I found rude and excessively informal.
2/ Didn’t receive the complimentary clean and vac – however the MOT price was reduced to £40 instead of a quoted £54.85
3/ Quotation for Work (needed to pass the MOT) was £941.32
4/ I took the SLK to a local garage in Warrington the next day and got it mended and passed through an MOT for £93
5/ Mercedes of Warrington passed the car the previous year (Feb 2017) with a blown brake light – so the MOT test hadn’t been done correctly / adequately.

Gets the ONE STAR, rather than ZERO because the girls on Reception are always friendly, helpful and polite."
2/24/18,5,"We recently purchased 2 cars from Lexus and found the whole experience to be excellent.
We were not prayed upon when browsing and left to look at our leisure.
When purchasing the customer Care was outstanding
Our sales rep was Dan from Derby and I can honesty say it was a pleasure to do buisiness with him.
Would absolutely recommend Lexus @ Derby"
2/24/18,5,"Booked in for airbag recall and took less than an hour. Very pleased with reception and overall service.
Would take car back again"
2/24/18,5,The staff are friendly and helpful. My courtesy car was ready for me. I was kept in full contact as to how my cars service was going. I had previously used a different mini garage but was unhappy with the service I received there so going forward I will be using Mini Copper Sunderland for services and also when I change my car.
2/24/18,5,"I had a rear tyre blowout on the M27 heading to a hotel in Torquay for work. managed to get to the slip road for Southampton. Called Jaguar Assist who turned up in 50 minutes and got me to Jaguar garage.

Initially told by Service desk there were no tyres but when she checked they had one to fit but all the techs go home at 5pm. (it was about 4.40pm)

I explained the situation and she made another call and a tech agreed to stay late and do it. about 6pm car done with new valve and I am back on the road to Torquay , great result and thank you to the girl on the service desk and the tech who stayed late ( girl with glasses) Thank you both so much . John"
2/24/18,5,"Very pleased with the helpful service from staff at Cobham. I had the car pick up collection & then regular phone updates on what my car needed, the time frame & when to expect the car back along with accurate quote of cost. All went as said & car returned with complementary valeting. Thank you Cobham. Jenny"
2/24/18,5,"Again superb service, well cared for at all times.."
2/23/18,5,It was an easy experience.
2/23/18,5,"Excellent service. Ryan Smith looked after everything extremely well, I cannot fault him."
2/23/18,5,This is an outstanding company and highly diligent even on little matters. I have already paid for three more sevices!
2/23/18,5,"From the minute you walk into the showroom you feel comfortable in the friendly atmosphere, nothing is too much trouble for the courteous, friendly, professional staff. They make the experience run smooth with no hassle whatsoever, they talk you through everything that's happening and answer all questions asked. I have dealt with a few top garages and this is by far the best in my opinion, try the experience for yourself you won't be disappointed."
2/23/18,5,Found the whole service and experience outstanding. Thank you
2/23/18,2,"Booked my XFR into H.A.Fox; Norwich, for a Major Service, 3 weeks in advance!
Arrived within the arranged (booked) timescale, (09:00-10:00hrs) only to be informed that the vehicle would not be completed until 17:00hrs. Having travelled up from Suffolk to be informed that we would have a 71/2 hr wait is totally, in my mind, unacceptable.
Having negotiated the finish time to 16:00hrs, we were offered transport to Norwich city centre with an agreed pick up time of between 15:30-15:40. Needless to say that the return transport was ""delayed"".
Upon return to H.A.Fox, i was informed that the vehicle was due, and given, a ""Minor"" service. (the vehicle was short of a Major service by 2K miles, hence my request for a ""Major"" service, as i did not wish to exceed the Major service at 32K during the coming 12 months). I was very angry at my request not being carried out. 70 miles each way only to be treated this way left a very nasty taste!
Just to cap the day off; they never even cleaned the vehicle as promised; sorry, but we never had time, was the reason!
Having spent all of my working life in the motor trade, i am left speechless!
I understand that H.A.Fox, Norwich, are very soon, moving premises alongside the Norwich ""Audi"" dealership. I came from ""Audi"" to Jaguar some 10 years ago. This may well be reversed!
Very angry."
2/23/18,5,Regular user. Very efficient.
2/23/18,5,"Great service. Told me car was going to be ready by 5 pm. Arrived 10 minutes early and car was ready at 5pm.
Highly recommend."
2/23/18,3,"My rating reflects the very mixed experience I had recently...
1. Unapologetic call (voicemail) 15 mins before closing time the day before my booked service and MOT, to inform me of no replacement vehicles while my car was going to be in for the service. This despite having booked the service approx. 3 weeks ahead of time and assurances given that a replacement would be available.
2. Wonderfully helpful, professional and friendly person on the main reception dealing with my subsequent call back.
3. Utterly fraught conversation with the service department booking person. So difficult that it induced a panic attack for me. I was left highly emotional and received zero empathy or care.
4. On taking the car to the service department the following day, received excellent customer service (this was not the same person from the telephone call), extremely courteous and helpful.
5. Car collected after the service and MOT, and all seems just perfect - great clean too!"
2/23/18,5,"I placed a parts order - a set of front windshield wipers for my Toyota Auris by phone with Ali, who called me back the same afternoon to say they received my order. Went to the establishment @ Battersea, where it was installed immediately. Paid the bill and departed, satisfied with the prompt service."
2/23/18,5,Excellent service
2/23/18,5,"Customer care, second to none."
2/23/18,5,"Went to coopers mini in Ipswich, the person I dealt with,Jeff was very informative, understood exactly what I wanted and was able to come up with the perfect car"
2/23/18,5,"Outsantding service , I have been to the same garage three times and on each vist I have been looked after by the same member of staff. It would be fair to say that George Pedro would be an asset to any organisation and that he is a credit to VW. The best customer service I have experienced while dealing with VW."
2/23/18,5,I've used Inchcape Swindon for servicing the Golf I bought there three years ago and have found them excellent. They communicate well with customers and keep you well-informed before during and after the work they do. I'm certainly happy to use them and to recommend them.
2/23/18,5,"Although my car has over 100,000miles on the clock and now is rather battered, I was treated with every courtesy and everything went to plan. I was reminded of my booking two days before the event and advised when the car was ready for collection. Although the work was completely free, the vehicle was given a visual safety check and I felt as though I had just had a major service. and that I was a long established customer.
Two very small observations
On completion- the clock was not reset
To exit the garage, if the painted road arrows are followed, you arrive at the rear and have to turn round and exit against the arrows. This can cause confusion"
2/23/18,1,Had car service no valet or car cleaned not happy
2/23/18,5,"Bought a Mini Cooper, we found Chris the sales personal very helpful."
2/23/18,4,"I was made to feel welcome and was offered numerous cups of coffee. The only downside was that I arrived having been told that a service wasn’t needed on my car as I had not clocked up many miles and that a free health check would be suffice , it was apparent that a service was required so I ended up paying out money that I hadn’t already budgeted for"
2/23/18,5,"Excellent service, friendly people. Thanks. You made my day."
2/23/18,5,"As an avid reviewer I believe it is equally as important to reflect great experiences as well as bad ones. All too readily we are prepared to only write reviews when they are bad. This experience was so good that I am reviewing here and somewhere else while I still remember staff names! Professional service, welcoming showroom, staff look happy and genuinely pleased to be assisting you. Lee Broadbridge and Alison Kilby particularly went above and beyond the call of duty and I am left wondering why we cant employ these customer friendly people everywhere else in life! I was not looking forward to taking my car in, as my last experience elsewhere wasn't great, however, I under estimated this lot! Thank you Lee for the service and to Alison for not making me feel inferior when I was asking questions only an idiot would ask! There was no air of superiority about her when she was explaining and her confidence was very reassuring. I have no doubt that both of these staff members are an asset to this company. Fantastic. Thank you! X"
2/23/18,5,"Very professional, pleasant staff, comfortable hospitality"
2/23/18,5,Excellent service couldn't have done more.
2/23/18,5,"Having in the past bought two new vehicles from East Kent Audi, I felt confident in returning - but this time to find an Approved Used TT. My worry that the experience would in some way be 'less' because I wasn't buying new, proved groundless. From the first point of contact with Kate, through the test drive (three-up in a TT is always fun), via negotiations, to the big day, I could have been collecting their most expensive A8 limousine! An outstanding experience on every level; the car was immaculately prepared and for the day to be dry and sunny made this a truly special moment. I would whole-heartedly recommend East Kent Audi!"
2/23/18,5,Excellent service. Very polite staff
2/23/18,5,Fantastic service from reception to driving my new car away! Thanks Tetbury audi.
2/23/18,5,I have five cars and have experienced all of the premium Marques in terms of service. The best service I have ever experienced in the past was at Lexus. The experience yesterday at BMW Sunderland was outstanding bettering that of anywhere else I have encountered.
2/23/18,5,As always pleasant doing business. Makes having a mot etc easy. Love the loans car.
2/23/18,5,Very helpful staff and an appointment time to suit.
2/23/18,5,"Prompt service, all aspects explained"
2/23/18,5,Excellent service
2/23/18,5,"Prompt and efficient, car booked in on time and returned on time, cannot fault them."
2/23/18,5,"On arriving to drop car off I was offered a beverage and was seen promptly (within a few mins). Kept informed of any issues by Audi Cam including quotations for any additional works (Only undertaken if you authorise). On collection I was offered a beverage and seen promptly (within less than 5 mins). All prices for work were as quoted, no variations. Car was cleaned internally and externally. Excellent."
2/23/18,5,"As usual all staff i dealt with were pleasant, polite and informative.
My car was returned to me on time and gleaming.
Very happy with everything."
2/23/18,5,Friendly and informative staff
2/23/18,5,"Billy was amazing, throughly went through features of my car that Rod didn’t tell me (app connect) that I didn’t even know existed! Layed out different options I could go for with my service. Amazing customer service. Thank you Billy!"
2/23/18,2,"I was told the check would take 2hrs I took my car in at 10.00am and was rang at 4.00pm and told it was ready too late for me to collect so I said I would collect the following day when I arrived at 11.30am the said they would bring around the car 20 minutes later I was still waiting only to be told they were then going to wash it I just said bring the car around forget the wash another 5mins it finally arrived
I am going to buy another x3 later this but now not from you"
2/23/18,4,Overall happy with the service. .
2/23/18,5,"I was served by your sales rep - Ben at your Maidstone branch. He had a very good approach, and I received a great service with all the details explained in depth to me."
2/23/18,2,"Driver's airbag recall work carried out successfully. I also requested a Winter Health Check, and received NO adverse feedback whatsoever. Advertised Free Winter Care Pack was refused - wrongly! After NINE phone calls & TWO e-mails, all of which were ignored, I gave up and am happy to report that BMW Cobham supplied this pack.
Almost immediately, three warning lights came on and the speedo died! On returning the car to Thames Ditton, the cause was found to be unconnected to the earlier work, and so was paid for in the normal manner. The garage then conducted a second (unsolicited) Winter Health Check, which resulting in a genuinely helpful video identifying issues with rear brakes, oil leaks and uneven tyre wear - NONE of which had been deemed worthy of comment just three weeks earlier???"
2/22/18,5,Excellent service. Ashley was really efficient and very polite.
2/22/18,5,Cooper Mini Malton dealership where do i start cannot praise the team enough from walking through the door and been greeted by Holly and Val who were so welcoming and helpful we were then introduced to Carl on the sales team his knowledge and professionalism stood out from the onset keeping us updated throughout nothing was to much trouble this was a bit of a sentimental purchase for my wife Carl and Jordan went out of there way to make it happen and for that i can’t thank them enough i cannot finish without mentioning the rest of the team they never failed to smile and say hello when ever we went into the showroom awesome 5* service we will definitely be using Malton Mini’s aftersales services thanks again of to enjoy our JCW now many thanks Rich n Jo Acko ✨✨✨✨
2/22/18,5,Good customer service.
2/22/18,5,"No problem at all, in fact on this occasion they went 'over and above' due to some problems I had - personal not with the car."
2/22/18,5,Excellent service can't fault them. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
2/22/18,5,Overall great customer service. All staff friendly and made me feel comfortable waiting for my MOT to be completed. They also cleaned my car spotless ! So impressed. I’ll be returning for servicing.
2/22/18,5,"From the e-mail informing me of MOT being due plus service requirement too, right through to picking my car up following the work being carried out, my interaction with all staff was to an excellent standard. TOP MARKS COOPER MINI DURHAM. Very happy customer."
2/22/18,5,"Fantastic service as usual, never had any complaints since I bought the car 7 years ago."
2/22/18,3,Repair job was great and cannot fault the level of service (picking up the car and returning within the day and great timeliness) but lack of transparency over ‘free health check’ which of course resulted in more work carried out does make me wonder how trustworthy this dealership is. If they had only asked me to agree to health check beforehand might feel differently.
2/22/18,5,I found the service from East Kent Audi to be exceptional. Brilliant team and our salesman Joseph went above and beyond to help advise us on cars and the best deal. Quick and efficient work. Saw the car i liked on monday and picked it up on wednesday. Just 2 days later. Everything was explained thoroughly and being yound customers we was taken very seriously. Cannot thank him and East Kent Audi as a whole team enough. From Theresa Jackson
2/22/18,5,"Absolutely delighted with my lovely new bmw X1. I live up in Glasgow and was very impressed that the car was delivered to me. John was very helpful showing me round the new car and taking away my old one.

Would like to thank Chris Mayes at Coopers Norwich for his excellent customer service. Nothing was a problem and he went out his way to help me through the process as I had never done this before.

Wouldn’t hesitate to buy a car from you again."
2/22/18,5,"I have been a customer of Mercedes for several years now. For me it was the right decision, based on their customer service, experience and professionalism.

We now own 2 Mercedes, for which we never look back."
2/22/18,5,"I found the dealership friendly, cost effective and efficient especially in assisting with explanations over the differing car specifications prior to order. I was kept fully up to date with the manufacture and transport of the vehicle before taking delivery of it and would certainly recommend the dealership and company to anyone."
2/22/18,5,Great facility. Friendly efficient staff. Work carried out on time. What more could you ask for.
2/22/18,5,"Excellent service at Inchcape,staff very friendly and my car was look at in quick time."
2/22/18,5,Very professional band friendly staff
2/22/18,5,"Again, Cooper BMW York provided me excellent service from start to finish of my MOT and service."
2/22/18,4,"Nice place,nice people,nice deals 👍"
2/22/18,4,"Excellent service. The only negative was the appointment system does not work. I arranged to drop the car off at 9.15am. It was nearly 10 00am by the time I was attended to.
I appreciate that it was a busy morning but why have appointment times if there is little likelihood of them being met?
Otherwise I was very pleased with the service I received."
2/22/18,5,"Responsive, friendly, helpful and transparent service from initial phone call all the way through."
2/22/18,2,"Not the best experience at This BMW dealership. I received a phone call informing me that my car was ready for collection. I arrived and checked in with the receptionist who appeared confused as to what to do with me. Believing she was new to the role, I repeatedly suggested I waited in the seating are and enjoyed a hot drink. She escorted me over and I waited for about 20 minutes before a service advisor was available.
I sat at his desk, he was lacking in customer service skills although polite, it felt as though he just wanted payment. I made my payment and waited in the seating area for a further 10 minutes until my car was brought up.
Promptly sent on my way and arrived home only to find no signs of my new MoT certificate and the service indicator was not reset. I returned straight away to have the issues rectified which it was. Overall, this was not the customer service I expect with BMW nor is it what I’ve experienced in the past. Whilst there, staff were having conversations openly, expressing their displeasure about another member of staff. This was not at all the first class professionalism BMW have built their reputation on. When I think of BMW, I think of elegance and class and this was once demonstrated by the staff. Not this time round."
2/22/18,4,"Good service offered all round, check in and out was seemless. One criticism was my dash cam was disconnected and left disconnected."
2/22/18,5,Job booked in on time. Good service and politeness from my service member.
2/22/18,5,"An easygoing and smooth personal service from start to finish.

Thank you to Steve, Richard and James at Cooper Tonbridge MINI - who were extremely friendly, approachable and professional throughout. Also for all their help and recommendations."
2/22/18,4,Took my car in for major service and cam belt change.Staff on Service desk very helpful and friendly. Had a problem with a leak on the fuel filter afterwards but I returned the car the next day and it was dealt with straight away. Overall very pleased with Inchcape Telford.
2/22/18,5,Excellent service . Highly recommend
2/22/18,4,The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that I would NEVER recommend any garage to family or friends. Having said that my recent experience on 21st February was first class.
2/22/18,5,Friendly helpful service - going above and beyond to get the best deal
2/22/18,4,"Excellent service experience, I actually used their business facilities while I waited... on the whole a very good service; what you'd expect from BMW."
2/22/18,4,"First time I have used Inchcape in Derby, great service Joshua took my cold call in the first instance and then looked after me right through the process to the delivery of the car.
Can't fault the service, we are currently purchasing two other Land Rover products off an alternative dealer and it is so hard work, I wish we had purchased them off Inchcape."
2/22/18,5,Really friendly service and very efficient
2/22/18,5,Excellent service as usual.
2/22/18,5,"5 star

2/21/18,5,Fantastic service from Coventry Mercedes as soon as we went through the door meeting Becky to inspection of the car to picking it up. Many thanks
2/21/18,5,"We had a pleasant transaction which went smoothly with no pressure from our salesperson, who was knowledgable and helpful, we got the car we wanted at a price that we wanted. We were well informed all along as to what would happen and when. On collection of the new car he was extremely helpful in demonstrating the cars features spending time with each of us and making sure that we were happy with everything. I have recommended Inchscape Warrington already to a friend and would continue to do so."

2/21/18,5,"Very good, excellent service throughout"

2/21/18,5,The service was carried out promptly and the car cleaned thoroughly The staff were friendly and informative.
2/21/18,5,"I’ve recently bought a new Toyota C-HR from Inchcape in Derby. The first time I’ve considered a Toyota but very likely not the last. My experience was really positive. No pushy salesmen, in fact Mark was honest and to the point when negotiating a good deal for me. I knew exactly what I was getting. The rest of the team dealing with the purchase were also friendly and helpful. Thank you everyone at the Derby showroom, I’m delighted with my new car."
2/21/18,5,"From the moment I entered the business at BMW Sunderland I was looked after. From the front desk staff to the service department . Once my Car was available I was shown out to my vehical and had the reassurance that if I was not happy , nothing would be too much to put it right. The car was of course in top condition and ready to go. A very plesant vist and a big thank you to all who made me feel relaxed and part of a team."
2/21/18,5,I found the staff very helpful and obliging. I only called in for a litre of top up oil but the sale person offered to put it in for me. Very pleased with the service I received.
2/21/18,5,"Excellent collect and return service - arrangements within requested parameters.

Car cleaned and fault clearly explained"
2/21/18,5,Very good customer service

2/21/18,5,"Excellent Service from start to finish. Professional attitude and very friendly. after service care is excellent, we noticed that he mats in the care had been cleaned and we actually thought new mats had been put in."
2/21/18,5,"Have dealt with them for a couple of years and have come to expect high standards. This full annual service again rates 5/5. Easy to communicate with, arrange a convenient time, hire car, feedback on the work done plus and what is on the horizon to do. Professional, courteous staff and clean comfortable showroom. I can be a bit picky but I’d struggle to find a real negative with them."
2/21/18,5,"Staff were friendly, polite and professional, keeping me updated with progress whilst the work was being done."
2/21/18,5,"I’m really pleased with the service that bmw Chelmsford provid me, I was keped up to date on the progress or my car, I highly recommend this garage,"

2/21/18,5,"After arranging a first service with Inchcape, I would reommend them to anyone considering who to book any work with. The staff were professional & helpfull at all times. I was constantly updated with progress reports and estimated finish time . As working on the road I found the lounge with all it's support services refreshing. I was able to work in excellent surroundings without disturbance. They get the full 5 stars for thier complete service."
2/21/18,5,"A very professional company; we felt very valued and was offered refreshments while we were waiting. Very friendly, polite and helpful staff. I would definitely recommend this company to my family and friends."
2/21/18,5,It is very convenient for me to work from home and have my car picked up and taken to the garage for servicing. I also received a video in good time which I reviewed.
2/21/18,4,Very quick turn around on completing the work required by the recall. The visual check was completed and I received a text which contained a link to the report and a video of the check which was excellent. Definitely recommend Mercedes and will be buying from there again. The only reason for four and not five is whenever I took my car to sytner they always returned it having washed it. As you can see not an essential but was the finishing touch.
2/21/18,5,Very knowledgeable and helpful. Great service and advice; able to accommodate at short notice.
2/20/18,5,"My experience with Mercedes has been nothing but positive from the start....
A service mechanic by the name of Nathan at Oxfords Inchcape has gone above and beyond to help us.
Our particular problem is not finished yet, but Nathan has been very helpful in trying to solve this query"
2/20/18,5,"Brilliant service.My car was collected and returned to me following a minor repair/recall from Mercedes.The car was returned having been cleaned and no charge for any of the work.I received a video of the condition of my cars brakes and suspension,pointing out the future repairs it might need.Very pleased with my first Mercedes experience and a very proud c class owner."
2/20/18,5,"Bought my first car from Malton Mini last week. I can highly recommend them. Glen the sales exec who dealt with us was excellent. Offered good advice, not pushy at all. And straight talking which I like. The other members of staff who I dealt with were equally as accommodating. And Val who greets you upon arrival. Overall a 10 out of 10 experience. I will certainly be going back when I come to change car again."
2/20/18,5,Very professional and helpful staff couldn't do enough for me on my vist to Stockport to get my annual 12 month service. Picked up my car and dropped off whilst I was at work. Saved me both time and any anxiety.
2/20/18,5,So far so good. After some discussions on spec/price etc. David from Sales found the car that matched my requirements. Car ordered and due to be collected on time later this week. Everyone involved has taken an interest and been helpful...with prompt feedback on any questions. Recommended.
2/20/18,5,I found that I urgently needed my brake pads replacing but the first available service appointment was in 3 weeks time. I went to the local Mercedes dealership in Oxford and after explaining the situation to the service manager he agreed to undertake the work there and then. What great customer service
2/20/18,5,"Excellent service. Competitive prices. Very friendly and accomodating staff.
Welcoming enviroment a real pleasure to deal with.
My service included a loan vehicle and a video health check of the vehicle.
A rewarding experience, I will definitely use you again and of course recommend you.
Thank you."
2/20/18,1,All smiles when they take your money. I bought a brand new golf r and was sold a service plan which I asked if I could move to the 7.5 golf as it was coming out before this mk7 would be due a service as I wanted the facelift but had placed order already so went through with purchase so when the facelift come out I had sold my mk7 golf r. Due to shocking paint finish I noticed after a while. Was told it needed to be painted to rectify the paint. ( I bought a new car to know it didn't hide anything under the paint) that was enough for me to get rid of it and the massive water leak it had in the boot. Every time it rained it filled the boot. After 3 times at local vw dealer to resolve (not inchcape ) I bought a brand new golf r facelift. When I sold my old golf r. It only had 1000 miles on it after about 6 months. Old. I called inchcape to swap plan over. Was told no. Nothing to do with them. I said I was told at time of sale I could. They said no. Contact vw finical services I did. They done not a thing except blame inchcape. I called on many occasions and was bounced from pillar to post. So I give up and going to motoring ombudsman they can contact the two of them. Was told lies and now messed about having to call the two of them and be messed about. But hey. They were happy to take my £30k easy.
2/20/18,5,"I cannot recommend the Jaguar dealership H A Fox in Chester highly enough. We dealt with Marco Roberts from the beginning and we found him to be extremely knowledgeable and professional right from the outset. The whole experience has been great, culminating in our new Jaguar F-Pace which we're all delighted with.
I look forward in keeping this relationship into the future as we doubt very much that we'll be changing brands.
Many thanks !"
2/20/18,1,Took car in for MOT and to check on a side light warning (both bulbs were still actually working) was told at 3pm Ish it passed MOT with no issues raised to me. Arrived at dealership to collect with additional bill for almost £40 for 2 bulbs which I could have bought elsewhere for £5 each. I had no option but to pay and was not provided with a failed MOT certificate despite being told that it failed its first MOT. On the basis I was told earlier in the day that the car had passed its MOT and they were then going on to look into the side light warning I can only assume it did not fail an MOT and regardless it is both principle and courtesy to get authority for any additional spend. Very disappointed with this.
2/20/18,5,Very easy process to get car serviced. Particularly impressed with the little video summary of the inspection.
2/20/18,5,"Easy to book a service. The staff were friendly, very polite, professional and explained what would happen. I was contacted to say all was okay and when my car was ready for collection.

Overall a great experience."
2/20/18,4,Upon breaking the lens of my SLK rear light I tried to get in touch with Jim Demetriou who looks after my car for me.He left a voicemail message advising me to phone a direct number to the service department. My call was answered by a surly man who took details of my registration number & curtly informed me that they would be back in touch with me when they had located & costed the part. That was three weeks ago.I phoned Al Noor Fayez yesterday.He was courteous and efficient.In less than 24hours the job was done.My trust in Mercedes has been restored.
2/20/18,5,"Always polite and curtious very helpful and I love that you clean the car as well
Thank you"
2/20/18,5,Staff very friendly and courteous and completely satisfied with the service
2/20/18,5,Very good service.
2/20/18,3,"I was using the lounge to work whilst my car was serviced, which was very useful. The staff were polite and courteous and not too intrusive. However, over the course of two and a half I was not offered another drink or any snacks, which I felt was a bit of a shortfall. Also, as my car is two years old it may have been opportune to offer me a test drive."
2/20/18,5,"The whole experience was way beyond what I was expecting. My S Type Jaguar went in for a minor job, which they said would mean having the car for the day. Absolutely fine with me, as they also said there was a loan car. This turned out to be a new XF RSport. Fabulous. I was treated as if I was buying a new one (which I hope to walk in and do one day)! The staff were courteous and pleasant as they always are when I go in for spares. Can't praise H A Fox Chester, James and Chris enough. Thank you."
2/20/18,4,"Driver picked my car up on time, and delivered in back clean and tidy, Automated video sent over for me to see the technician completing the service checks, and overall very happy with service provided."
2/20/18,1,"My experience was not a good one at all. I wanted an AYGO following an ad I had seen on the Toyota website. I needed it quickly because I had just moved home and the commute to school was difficult. The sale went fine I paid my deposit and was advised I would be contacted to come in and sign the finance paperwork. I was never contacted so I had to give them a call. I went in to sign the agreement at an agreed time and was left waiting for 40 minutes before anyone saw me. On going through the paperwork I discovered that additional extras had been added to my order ( none that were agreed by me) which took the amount I agreed to pay over what I was prepared to. The did remove the extras and then advised my car would be ready this Monday. No one contacted me to agree a pick up time and yet again I found myself getting in touch. I was advised that my collection time was late afternoon and that just didn’t suit. Eventually it was agreed I would collect the car at 12.30. I turned up with a 5 year old and a car seat! Again I was left waiting for 20 minutes and then the sales and finance people came to see me and advised the finance could not be agreed until I provided 2 proofs of address. Please bear in mind this is almost 3 weeks from order, signing the finance agreement and me having to chase progress. In the end I told them to cancel the car and give me my deposit back which was over 2k. The finance person scuttled away disclaiming this was not her fault - never to be seen again. I was left a the dealership annoyed and with no transport. Stood outside waiting for my partner to pick me up the Used Sales Manager came out to see me and to be fair he asked me to give home the opportunity to sort things out. I went home and 30mins later I was contacted by the Manager to state the finance was sorted, no needed for the proof of address, and he personall brought the car to my address with a full tank of fuel. Credit where credit is due he did sort it out at the final moment but I have to be honest my experience was not good at all - it kinda spoilt that new car moment. Think twice before going to this dealership Managers only step in when things have gone beyond a problem and what sticks in my mind is how quickly the finance person washed their hands of it and tried to avoid taking any responsibility in a comedy sketch it would have been quite funny. No one spending their good money should expect this level of service. They only get one star because I can’t post without selecting one!"
2/20/18,5,"Amazing experience, completed work in time!"
2/20/18,5,"Excellent customer service at usual from the team at Coopers Colchester
Kept informed as the progress was made during the service . Completed within the scheduled time and price as quoted"
2/20/18,4,"When collecting my car I was asked to take a seat by reception as I was informed the girl dealing with me was busy with a customer. After 10 minutes I approached reception again to enquire about picking up my vehicle. To be fair I was then dealt with within a couple of minutes.
Emma explained that she was not aware I had been waiting.
Would have been 5 stars but this experience deserves only a rating of 4"
2/20/18,5,Coopers T.D. refurbished the alloy wheels on my car yesterday. The job was completed ahead of the time estimated and with good results. I was happy with all aspects of my contact with them.
2/20/18,5,"Car was booked in for a service. A driver took us in to city centre & picked us up.One wheel that was showing signs of corrosion will be replaced.
Wipers that we pointed out, were adjusted so as to stop them hitting the pillar.All staff very pleasant and friendly.
Only negative point was that we asked if the book had been stamped and were told yes, however it wasn't.
We do know that it is all electronic now but we are of an age that we like the paper too!"
2/20/18,3,Kept me waiting 45 mins to see an adviser to go through my booking. Appears reception hadn't informed him I was there and when I reminded them I was - didnt seem apologetic. Service adviser Mathew perfect though.
2/20/18,5,"Called on to purchase a spare key. Was served by a very helpful lady who told me how to initiate it as it was being posted to me. First class service, thank you"
2/20/18,5,"The ""collect and return"" car service went really well, with a friendly and polite driver. Communication throughout the service was good. I also iike the under car video so you get to see the parts of the car not readily accessible."
2/20/18,5,I found them to be courteous and professional and had total knowledge of the product
2/20/18,4,Apart from a previously damaged loan car all was acceptable.
2/20/18,5,A truly professional outfit from start to finish. Highly recommend Charlie Elliott - he is an asset to Cooper Chelmsford.
2/20/18,5,"Superbly looked after

Booking was easy, they dealt with my long list of work to be dine on the day and were prepared to let me have a loan car for a few days if required at short notice."
2/20/18,5,"Professional and efficient, excellent customer service."
2/20/18,5,Outstanding customer service. Car in for service and excellent in every way. When I am due to change my vehicle in 2019 here will be my first call without doubt
2/20/18,5,Great service from the first phone call up to collecting the car afterwards
2/19/18,5,"Inchcape contacted me to advise that my Tiguan required the cambelt replaced, no pressure, just a simple call with the information. I considered the offer to carry out this modification and decided to book in the car. I checked the price quoted against the internet and arrived at an agreeable figure. Booking in the car couldn't have been made any easier and I was kept informed of the progress at all times. Inchcape's practice of sending a video of the free safety inspection is an excellent idea and adds to the trust that I feel they have built with me, even after such a short relationship. Inchcape delivered all the promises that they made and the car was completed slightly quicker than their estimated time, All round it was an entirely satisfying experience and I have no doubt that I will continue to utilise this excellent dealership who appear to go the extra mile to provide the ultimate customer experience."
2/19/18,4,"Busy place, but efficient. Staff were very friendly"
2/19/18,5,Brilliant service. I would gladly use bmw coopers Reading again
2/19/18,4,"sales person friendly and helpfull.
only point i have is with the gardx protection i had applied,area's of the car
plus inside wear not as clean as i would of expected , having had previous cars done with the same treatment on this occasion i felt it fell short of my expectations."
2/19/18,5,Very helpful and great car!
2/19/18,5,A very efficient team looks after all your requirements.
2/19/18,5,"We went to Inchcape Audi, Cheshire Oaks after we found our local Audi dealers service very dissapointing. We got a great deal on our new car and the customer service was outstanding. We would recommend them to anyone and will be back when want to change our car again."
2/19/18,5,"The booking, collection, service and return was carried out efficiently and promptly. My contact Laura was helpful, cheerful and knowledgeable, and made the experience very straightforward."
2/19/18,4,"After a lot of unsuccessful attempts to book our car in with our local VW dealership (Beadles) less than a mile from our address. We finally contacted Inchcape over 18 miles away to have our car serviced. From the first call to the service on the day, everyone was polite, professional and pleasant! Wayne who attended to us on the day kept us well informed. We have taken out a service plan and intend to go back for future service. The best part is the cost of the service being cheaper than a local garage."
2/19/18,5,"I have been to Cooper's Mini Norwich 4 times now and have found out what true quality and excellent customer service is.
I cannot fault them, and would recommend them to any and everyone who values excellence as standard.
Well done Cooper's and keep it up, thanks"
2/19/18,5,Great customer service from Justin. He went the extra mile to look after me. The car was taken care of very well. I was kept updated with progress well by Justin. I am confident of receiving great service again from Justin when my car is next in. Thanks
2/19/18,1,"I went onto the BMW Uk approved used car web site as I wanted to buy a fairly new,but fully warranted BMW. I found the ideal car listed and being sold at Cooper BMW Teesside. I arranged an appointment to test drive the 520D GT and was delighted with the car so I decided after further negotiation to purchase it there and then . The used sales manager and sales executive both commented on how lucky I was because,apparently the car advertising price had just been reduced considerably on the BMW UK used web site. . The purchase price & my part ex was verbally agreed by the sales manager,Sales executive and myself as per the Advertised price. I then went to settle the outstanding balance with the sales executive via debit card, But !! just before the transaction was completed the Used Sales Manager informed me he could no-longer let the car go at the advertised price. He requested another £4000.00 + to buy the said car . I was absolutly gutted !! I spent nearly 4 hours at the dealership and we must have gone over the figures at least 3 times!! Only to find out at literally the very last minute they have supposedly priced it incorrectly ,what the hell ? I just got up and left the dealership without saying a lot really . I was really annoyed and to be honest upset and feeling very aggrieved.

**As a follow up** to the Reply below From Cooper BMW. **No** call or discussion & no apologies ever materialized. I ended up traveling to Scotland to purchase the same model from another dealer. A straight forward purchase & a saving of well over £2000.00 ."
2/19/18,4,Nice People easy to deal with; no problems encountered.
2/19/18,5,"Carl at the Cooper Malton site was great, very helpful and informative and helped me succeed the deal I needed"
2/19/18,2,"Don't think twice, think 3 times,

Car purchased BMW 630d M Sport x-Drive

I shouldn't of paid my deposit balance before entering the handover room & the outcome may of been different !

The car was the showroom model & the first thing evident was scratches in the roof paintwork, closer inspection showed scratches in 3 different locations which were very prominent, I was promised that someone will collect my new car & remove them in the bodyshop !

when we viewed the vehicle in the showroom there was a prominent dirty mark on the cream centre armrest which we were assured would be removed when the car was prepared ready for collection, the same mark was in the same location & I was assured the valeting team would correct it when the paintwork was repaired

Additionally the vehicle status on the dash was saying ""Replace Battery"" rather alarming for a brand new vehicle but I was assured this would correct when driven & the charge exceeded a certain percentage 4days in & the car is still permanently displaying ""Replace Battery"" even down to the smallest things such as bits of paper under the seats & elastic bands left on the rear seat belts

Given that The bodyshop failed on the paintwork, the valeting team failed the interior & the workshop failed the mechanical inspection there is clearly no form of Pre-Delivery inspection in place whatsoever, ironically the vehicle itself drives like a dream which frustrates all the more as the experience should of been so different"
2/19/18,5,Very happy with the service provided by the team at Cooper BMW Chelmsford
2/19/18,5,Good communication before during and after the service.
2/19/18,5,"Excellent, efficient service. Staff very polite and helpful"
2/19/18,5,"Excellent - reception quick and well organised, service and M.O.T. carried out quickly - visual health check is really useful and to top everything the Car was delivered to my home, which I had not requested and which was truly appreciated as my wife was unwell that day."
2/19/18,5,"Excellent service polite and very efficient and friendly, would highly recommend."
2/19/18,5,"As always, great service from Audi in Swindon. Hannah was very helpful and kept me informed during the day about what needed to be done and when the car was ready to collect."
2/19/18,5,"Excellent customer care , seems very genuine too."
2/19/18,2,"I took my wifes car (Polo) in to sort out a rattle in the dashboard. I went on a drive in the morning with the guys and told them what was wrong with the car. During the day I didn't hear a thing from anyone, I had to call in several times as nobody was available to take my call, so I decided to go in and find out what was going on.

When I got there, they told me exactly what I had told them in the morning and did nothing on the car, the rattle was still there. They even charged me £60 for hooking the car up to the diagnostic machine. The best part of this story was that I was seriously considering purchasing a new Tiguan R Line as I was invited as a VIP for the event that was running on the same day. I guess the £60 was worth it in the long run, relatively inexpensive way of not making a very bad decision and purchasing an expensive car... Imagine the Tiguan had a rattle."
2/19/18,5,Friendly greeting. Efficient management of the process. Ability to view the underside of the car with a video (send by email) very reassuring. Can't fault service received and a cleaned car inside and out on pick up.
2/19/18,5,I had my vehicle booked in for a MOT and service. I received an exceptional level of service from Nitesh Varsani. I was very pleased with the service I received.
2/19/18,5,Excellent service . Good environment. I booked my car for service . I had excellent service and experience with Cooper Reading /
2/19/18,5,Amazing once again. Thank you Sam for finding us the perfect car and another great deal. Cannot fault the exceptional service
2/19/18,5,Excellent service provided my Mikey and his service team. Kept informed of all work required and was all complete ahead of schedule. Car was returned cleaned inside and out.
2/19/18,5,Particularly appreciated was the parking of my car by a staff member on arrival when the car park was extrememely busy.
2/19/18,5,Helpful and accommodating
2/19/18,5,Quality dealership with top class customer service (well done Barry)
2/19/18,5,"I found the experience very straightforward and easy. Iva, the lady that served me was brilliant, I couldn’t fault her at all and was very impressed with her knowledge and helpful nature. Courtesy car was great and the process was simple. Very happy."
2/19/18,5,"I purchased a Mini from Cooper Thames Ditton Mini dealership last week. The salesperson I dealt with was Karl Joslin, having previously owned a Mini I already new I’d like the new model. Karl explained things well while I test dove the car. Once back at the dealership he went through pricing, features on the car etc. At no point was he pushy or rushed my decision making and was highly professional throughout, answering all my questions. I would certainly recommend the dealership and Karl.
Andrew James"
2/19/18,5,"Booked online, no problem. Asked if it could be done quickly when i dropped car off. They gave me a time when it would be ready and rang me twenty minute before to say it was ready. Excellent, polite service."
2/19/18,5,Was dealt with politely and efficiently. Only downside was the free clean and valet was poor but as it was free I let that go.
2/19/18,4,"Good all round experience, bike serviced promptly while I waited. Nice showroom with free coffee while you wait, and no hassle from the sales staff to get you to trade in !"
2/19/18,3,"The Service was generally very good even though there was a delay which was not down to the staff. When I first booked the car in I was asked if I would like it Valeted. Whilst I was in a hurry because of the technical hitch the standard of the Valet was pretty poor.
Keith Richardson"
2/19/18,4,"Recent service on my CLA, good courtesy car available, plenty of reminders that the service was coming up.
Not cheap but easy to arrange and the satisfaction of knowing genuine parts used.
Will have no hesitation in using again."
2/19/18,5,"Excellent service all round. Not only did the look after my car, but me too when I had tyre problems. Can highly recommend."
2/19/18,5,"What can I say? Ease of booking service, customer service and collection was 100%. That's why I bought a Mercedes..............."
2/19/18,5,Had a great experience buying my new merc from Katie at Inchcape in Coventry. The merc dealership there value your custom and enquiries even after they’ve sold you the vehicle. Very professional and friendly and knowledgeable about their product.
2/19/18,5,"Good from start to finish. Understood my needs, gave me decent vehicle options and worked the finances to meet my budget. Good communication along the way as well."
2/19/18,4,"Job completed ok, car valeted very nicely. More communication would be better but all in all satisfied with completed work."
2/19/18,5,"I had my car servicing and MOT done by Inchcape Volkswagen Colchester.

The service was excellent. I asked for my car to be picked up and delivered back after completion.

Staff were very polite and helpful, they picked up my car on time and emailed me the service report with a video. They also cleaned my car and returned it within the agreed time.

All in all great and efficient service.
I highly recommend their services."
2/19/18,5,Very good customer service
2/18/18,1,"Visited today (Colchester) to view a 3 series tourer, I didn’t have an appointment. The receptionist was very pleasant and said they were busy, however I saw several staff members doing very little? I asked if we could just look at a tourer and could they open one up for us without a sales person, the receptionist tried but the individual she asked was very rude and stated “I’m not prepared to do that”. .... then walked off.
I wasn’t asking for keys or a test drive etc just to sit in a car I was going to spend £25,000 on! Not too much really.
First visit to Cooper BMW and now my last. For what is supposedly a premium product the sales certainly isn’t.
Will spend my money elsewhere.
(No issues with receptionist, think she’s fed up of working with a bunch of muppets with delusions of granduer!)"
2/18/18,5,Excellent customer service.. We bought an A class Mercedes from James at Warrington last month and he was amazing and couldn’t do enough to help.. Would highly recommend Them and will definately be returning when it’s time for a new one
2/18/18,4,Great service from Ipswich mini. I would thoroughly recommend it.
2/18/18,4,If the car had been available for collection at or close to the time I requested it I would willingly have given you five stars.
2/18/18,2,"We bought a lovely sporty black mini from this garage about six months ago. I was shown how the computer controls inside the car work and was told when the service light comes on just book it in. So I did. they came to pick up the car from my home and dropped it back. One tick. The gentleman who dropped it was lovely, Second tick.
I receive a call at around 4.30pm from Mark another gentleman who says my car is almost ready and can I pay for the MOT??? I was not told it was an MOT as I booked in for a service which is included in the first years guarantee. Not only did they not inform me of this, they had my car all day so I could not get my jobs done. After Mark tried to pass the buck to the people who booked my car in centrally I was aghast at his unprofessionalism with no apology. It was obvious they had made a mistake. He ended the call saying he will send the car back to me (in an abrupt manner). It was delivered back to me uncleaned after they said it had been cleaned. It was more dirty than when I sent it to them. Not only that they didn't even give me the MOT certificate, just a service slip. Funny!! I thought it wasn't a service. They caused me so much stress and left a bad taste in my mouth. After there mistake you would think they would give me the certificate for causing me so much inconvenience and stress."
2/17/18,2,Very poor communication. The service department failed to return calls. I was quoted £60 more for the same work than at another Inchcape dealership. They grudgingly offered to price match but there was no explanation or apology. The general manager ignored me when I spoke to him. When I arrived at 8.00 to drop my car off the showroom was locked and I was left outside in the cold for 5 minutes while they unlocked. I will not use this dealership again.
2/17/18,1,"Customer service! Mercedes Warrington do not know what that means!! I am unable to give this garage zero stars so 1 will have to do. Reluctantly.
Called up for an update on my vehicle that was in service department and was told the person dealing with it was on the phone and would call me back! No call back received. I called again to be given the same message! Again no call back recieved. I called back again only to be told by the sales team the service department had gone home, they leave at 6pm!! The salesperson did go to see if anyone was around but came back to inform me they had gone and to call back at 8.30 in the morning! This would be Saturday morning when the service team are not about. The garage was aware I was away and arranged for car to be collected on Saturday morning! No communication meant I had to mess people around and have there plans cancelled due to this mess!
I then received a call from Mercedes where all I heard in the back ground were male voices swearing. The phone was then put down and call terminated by the garage. I immediately received a call back from the service guy advising me he was about he hadn’t gone home, he was just hiding!! Joke as this may be, I didn’t find it so funny. He advised me that my car was ready, issues had been resolved and due to it being a Saturday my key could be collected in an envelope with location given of vehicle at reception.
I had a voucher for a valet on my car which when I dropped off my vehicle I asked if this could be used, I was told yes no problem we will clean it anyway, don’t worry. Car given back unvaleted when promised would be done.
I really could go on with so many negatives with this garage but am not prepared to waste anymore of my time or money on them.
Sorry I bothered with them. Keep away."
2/17/18,5,"efficient, good communication helpful , happy to help and answer question
Georgie especially helpful"
2/17/18,5,"The service and all the staff are very good.
The car was ready and washed on time.
Thank you."
2/17/18,3,"When I was in business our rule for answering 'phone calls was 3 rings maximum before answering. I had to hold on for several minutes before anyone at MB answered my call regarding my online booking. The service reception was good but no offer of refreshments was made at any time during my 2 hours wait.

The service itself seems to have been carried out to a very good standard and I was pleasantly surprised to receive a video of the ""Health Check"". The convenience of online booking and the online communications relating to the service were very good, so the star rating would have been much higher but for the aforementioned shortcomings in the reception area."
2/17/18,1,"I purchased a car from mercedes inchcape in Nottingham, I was misled and they made promises to me to purchase a car from them, what they had promised turned out to be completely fabricated information, I made a complaint and to try and correct the problem I was misled and lied to AGAIN!!!!, one of the managers said to correct the complaint he would take my car back and sell me a used CLS from another branch at cost price of £28001, that transaction didn't go through, I found out through looking online that the car was being sold at the retail price for £27987 so less money than i was offered at cost so lied to again, throughout the complaint they made error after error and I just kept showing them proof they where wrong, they gave me a final response that they where not in the wrong, my complaint went to the financial ombudsmen and they have made the decision I was mis sold the car and finance, but the finance company is liable due to financial rules so I have to now make a complaint to them and then they can chase inchcape and I have been advised by the ombudsman because they can't deal with the mis selling of the car only the financial side, to take the matter of mis selling the product to trading standards and the financial ombudsman will pass there findings and information to them, I am angry with myself as i thought being in a mercedes dealership, not some backstreet used car garage I would be treated with respect and honesty, my advice is be very careful and get them to write down and sign anything they offer, this is not a reputable company and there only interested in lining their own pockets

27/02/2018
Mercedes responded to this review as seen below but they never got back to me as it says, i personally think this was a attempt to look as if they are concerned for me and want to help but only for the benefit of the people reading the review, I have now got the financial ombudsman's final response which shows they are at fault, the complaint has now been referred from the citizens advise to the trading standards and they are now investigating it as advised by them to speak to the FCA who have now got there supervisory department investigating it, I have given Mercedes Inchcape every opportunity to sort this out but they dont"
2/17/18,4,"Friendly and helpful service. However I did have a small gripe which could be of interest. I am on a service agreement and pay a monthly fee. When I checked my documents on return of the car I could not see any checklist on what was done and what I had payed for, in fact the only way I could confirm that the service had been done was to check (on the car) that a new oil filter had been fitted. I expected an invoice of some sort with items such as filters, oil, washers against costs."
2/17/18,5,"Brilliant service. Car was picked up and returned in pristine condition after
The service."
2/17/18,3,Waited too long
2/17/18,4,First service here at Liverpool was great from when I walked through the door to when left staff very good only Little point parking was very limited
2/16/18,5,Amazing customer service from the time I booked a test drive to the completion of the sale . Totally recommended
2/16/18,5,"Dealing with Demetrius Sciarrillo as a pleasure from minute one. He was attentive and honest, if he didn't know the answer, he would go away and find out. Smooth buy and he managed to do a fair deal for both parties. Would strongly recommend!"
2/16/18,1,Mini Cooper feel ashamed. Service Dept at RTW is a totally disgrace to your profession. All the good work tour sales staff do is totally wasted with the back room staff. Just buying a new mini but not from RTW I’m totally disguised with the service I received and what I also listened to in the service sept. Totally mis quoted and it has left a bitter taste. Take a walk of shame Arden Group. You have bought a franchise and destroyed it
2/16/18,5,Very good and one happy customer
2/16/18,5,Extremely good experience - felt welcomed on arrival - even down to a cup of coffee! The work was outlined and the service costed clearly. The courtesy car was excellent. The work on my car ( electrical- a recall by BMW) plus a service was done extremely quickly- no hidden extras!! It was returned to me beautifully cleaned.
2/16/18,5,Inchcape Coventry Merc are the best. They have made sure that customers are well looked after. I have always had servicing and MOT with them with no issues. They always pick the car from home in time and drop it back same day. I have found them the most approachable and helpful and always keep you updated for any parts that needs changing.
2/16/18,5,"Top service and wonderful staff, specially Steve and Mike. Very pleased."
2/16/18,5,"Excellent service, efficiently dealt with by Ben Lempriere."
2/16/18,4,Dealt with fault on my car very quickly and efficiently. Service team very helpful.
2/16/18,5,"As always, Hunters servicing department met my requirements - thanks Alan.

Vehicle collected and returned as requested. Liked the video of the health check!! Unfortunately the valet was not up to normal standards but can understand when your cleaner is overwhelmed with the amount he has to clean!!

Overall very satisfied."
2/16/18,5,Excellent all round service
2/16/18,5,Great service from Paul Care. Everything went according to plan and agreed timing was perfect. Have now bought 2 cars from Paul and both purchases have worked perfectly. Nigel Fulton.
2/16/18,5,"Car Service

Steve in Servicing was very helpful, also Craig who kindly dropped me into Guildford was a star.
As usual all Lexus Guildford staff from reception to servicing (including Lloyd, who sent me a video his work) were excellent and a credit to Lexus.

Thank you and see you on the 5th March"
2/16/18,5,Excellent service. Kept informed at every stage.
2/16/18,3,"Evoque in as rear camera not working and traction control warning had come on for a short time. Also MOT to be done and full valet as they forgot about cleaning car when it was serviced.

Rear camera was replaced. I was advised the pump for traction was replaced but paperwork does not indicate this. Also MOT was supposed to be dated from March as required but was not.

The customer service woman was great but some of the words don’t meet the actions"
2/16/18,5,Excellent service from Michael at Coopers Norwich with helping us to buy our first BMW. Very professional and friendly service and highly recommended. Love our X3!
2/16/18,5,I received excellent service from everyone at Inchcape UK while I was buying a car from them. They made the process easy and enjoyable.
2/16/18,5,"Excellent service from this company, Picked up car from 25 miles away & returned it, problem fixed - later that day. Very reasonable price, I would recommend them to any BMW owner who needs a professional engineer to look at & fix their vehicle.
Faith, who is their service adviser, worth her weight in Gold!!"
2/16/18,4,"Drop off is smooth and hassle free. I was kept up to date with the check of my car and emailed the visual report ahead of picking it up, so I could raise any issues that came up if needed."
2/16/18,5,Great service
2/16/18,4,MOT only so found attention OK
2/16/18,5,"I live 12 miles away from my garage and was pleased that my car was collected and delivered back within the timescales agreed. My service was carried out and a video of my car’s vehicle inspection was emailed to me for me to view at my convenience. All staff from initial booking with the service booking line were extremely courteous, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. My car was returned to me washed and vacuumed. Overall an excellent service provided by everyone involved and the reason I will continue to buy Mercedes."
2/16/18,4,"Safety earthing issue vehicle recall. Took a little longer than advised it would due to being very busy. I got a video of the safety health check and car washed and vacuumed.

2/16/18,5,Great service as usual thanks guy's
2/16/18,3,"The service aspect went well, however, I am waiting to hear regarding an item that was missed when the car was last serviced and is now 12 months overdue. I was informed when I purchased the vehicle all servicing was up to date and nothing need doing until the next service The item in question is an Air conditioning service that was not undertaken after two years and should have been. I am therefore owed a free air con service to bring the servicing up to date.

Although the car was ""cleaned"" inside and out the windows were so dirty I had to stop to clean them on the way home (driving into sun). Could I suggest that after drying the water off, the glass is polished with a clean dry cloth."
2/16/18,5,Great service done by Audi. Whilst waiting for my car to be serviced I was able to work upstairs in the business lounge!
2/16/18,5,"Fitted me in at short notice, great friendly service from Aaron. Many thanks."
2/15/18,1,"Purchased a new car from Twickenham VW 6 weeks ago and at first seemed really friendly, however they made an admin error and incorrectly registered my can as a 5 door , so when I got the log book the model did not match what was in the log book. All I can say is that when I tried to get their help to sort this the service received was appalling they could not care less. I had a car that was no longer insured as the model did not match the log book and this was their fault yet they just did not care. Believe me when you go in to buy a car they are charming, then subsequently once you part with your cash they don’t care one iota Check the reviews on trust pilot and see how they respond to any positive review in comparison to the very many negative reviews. Says a lot! I only wish I had read these before I purchased from them. Please please take my advice, don’t fall into the trap go elsewhere. I am in the throws of discussing my story with Auto Express and hope they will publish the story to show them up for how they operate and treat customers"
2/15/18,5,"My wife and I would like to thank Danny Rhodes for the fantastic support during our selection and purchase of our Audi Q5. Danny's attention to detail and customer service is amongst the best I have ever received.

2/15/18,5,"Another outstanding experience from Hunters. You couldn’t wish for a more informative, interesting and exciting time whilst buying a car. Very well looked after by Richard and Andi again. Top points for the new sales man Simon. If your reading this Simon, I will be back to buy my next car from you for defo. Thank you to the receptionists, Andy and Rebecca too, what wonderful girls you are. I would highly recommend Hunters Kings Lynn and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the named people too. Thank you all and see you soon"
2/15/18,4,"Excellent reception and friendly service staff - who were very professional and knowledgable. Comfortable waiting area with coffee, tea, TV and newspapers provided and the 2 hour wait flew by. Video taken of the visible inspection and sent to my I-Pad during the inspection. Results of the service fully explained at the end. I would have given a 5* review but for the valeting issue.

As part of the Service the car is fully valeted but in this area Inchcape let themselves down. Whilst the interior & exterior of the car was washed and vacuumed there were a number of examples of poor quality work - the boot had clearly not been opened, and certainly not been vacuumed; the space by the bonnet hinges, immediately below the windscreen, had not been cleared out as there were a number of dead leaves remaining where they had become trapped; parts of the windscreen had the residue of the cleaning agent - a pale white, milky substance - remaining so the screen had not been polished. It took some time to clear the screen using the wipers and screen wash.

Apart from the valeting issue, it was a very good experience and Inchcape did an excellent job. I would highly recommend them."
2/15/18,4,"Service receptionist Chris was great, went out of his way to help my wife. 4 stars because the curtesy wash was not very good. I did wonder if they did it at all. Why can it not be done befor it goes into service then there is no big rush at the end. Oil was spilt on the engine cover and not cleaned off properly!"
2/15/18,5,Very happy with the professional service received.

2/15/18,5,"Had my car brakes done, booked my service through Henry, thorough professional, right from booking to reminder phone call a day before to keep me updated about the works progress on the day, Henry is a pleasure to deal with.

So far I always have a positive experience at VW Inchcape Twickenham and hope it continues the same way.

2/14/18,5,"I just bought a discovery four at inchcape. All the staff including Angie the hostest made you feel very welcome. Keith Richardson the sales person went the extra mile as did Jamie Waite the business manager. It really was a nice place to buy a car. I also met John the service manager, and if I needed any advice or help to get I touch with him. I would recommend any person who's interested in buying landrover. Go to Inchcape. Norwich. You will not be dissapionted. Best Wishes Les Elvines"

Again, many thanks to you and all involved and I look forward to my next visit.

Kindest regards,

2/14/18,5,From the initial phone call to the delivery of my vehicle my experience was excellent. Old fashioned customer service from a modern day Main Dealer.
2/14/18,4,"Excellent Customer service from well informed friendly staff.
Service carried out well within the timescale I had been advised of with no glitches whatsoever.
I was very impressed by the all round service I received."
2/14/18,5,Truly impeccable service. Alice was amazing and very thorough. They looked after me and my car like I had just bought an R8!!!!!
2/14/18,1,"UPDATE 19/02/18 - Inchcape sent me a generic email on the 15th which I replied to. No response yet and this pretty much confirms both VW and Inchcape are a company/companies with 0 integrity who should be avoided at all costs. Their reply below is to simply make them look like they value their customers to anyone reading.


DO NOT GO TO ROMFORD INCHCAPE!!

Their aftersales is atrocious. Chelmsford inchcape even agreed with me!!

The below occured on a 2013 Golf nought from Romford inchcape.

1) Bodywork - When I placed the order for the car there were a number of scratches on the rear bumper which I was told would be repaired prior to me taking possession of the car. The repair was obviously below the standard expected of an 'Approved' used car as the paint started peeling. I have got a professional opinion on the repair of which I have been told this is most likely a 'smart repair' which are renowned for their unreliability. They are not interested in undertaking the repair.

 
2) Price - When we looked at the car the price in the window was circa 10,500 (Around the price I paid) I was told by the sales rep and manager that this is a mistake and the value is 11,150. My wife then returned the next day only to see the car up for 10,500.

3)  Headlight Failure - When I came to pick up the car before I even started the engine the warning light came on which flagged up a headlight fault. This was fixed by Volkswagen so I have no complaints over that however it does make me question whether the correct QA procedures were even carried out as the engine wasn't started prior to this which tells me the fault was existing?

4) Spare Key – When I arrived to collect the car the spare key was not working. I was told that one would be ordered and send to me in around 10 working days maximum. 10 working days passed, no key, after constant chasing the key was made available to me around a month after the initial purchase.

5) Automatic Headlights – These stopped working around 2 months after purchase. Appreciate they were fixed by Volkswagen but this again makes me question the QA procedures undertaken by VW prior to purchase of a car.

6) Door Latch - Last but not least. The passenger door latch came loose to the point of me feeling the door may come off if opened with force. Major safety failure in my opinion."
2/14/18,5,"Dealing with Inchcape (Stockport Audi) was a pleasure. Very polite and very helpful. I travelled from Scotland and the car was as described, deal was exactly as they said it would be. Very pleased."
2/14/18,5,Mercedes Inchcape Oxford always provide great customer service
2/14/18,4,Great service and made to feel welcome by Lucy who explained everything. Only issue was upon collecting the car I was waiting for over 30 minutes to be seen so I could pay and collect my keys. There appears to be no order in which customers were being seen to at the end of the day. A lady came in 15 minutes after myself and was seen before me. Very small point but overall very pleased with the work and my car was valeted inside and out.
2/14/18,4,polite efficient and honest can't ask for more
2/14/18,2,"Took my car in for a service, courtesy car wasn't ready, needed de-icing and re-fueling, I was then mistakenly given the keys to another customers car, luckily I spotted the mistake before driving off. Not the greatest experience when paying for a full service. Also arranged to meet the sales team, I had booked the appointment and after having to wait for over an hour for my courtesy car, they still hadn't arrived, so left without speaking to anyone. Not the standard of service I am used to here."
2/14/18,5,I have been a customer of HA Fox Southampton for the past 17 years and they have always provided an excellent service. My car was serviced and mot'd yesterday - the communications/ information from the service dept and the engineer working on my car was outstanding. All the required work was completed and my car was ready for collection on time.
2/14/18,5,Very good service
2/14/18,5,Friendly and efficient staff. Hassle free experience
2/14/18,5,"Superb service at airbag recall yesterday.
Staff very attentive and prompt. Work appeared well done, and the visual inspection was useful.
My only problem was that there wasn't a single parking space free (not sure if I would have been ok parking with all the Lexuses next door, but since I was early I did eventually find a space).
Facilities while waiting were excellent, with comfortable chairs and tables, newspapers and hot drinks.
As always, Inchcape Uk service was excellent."
2/14/18,5,Brilliant service. Could not be happier really took the stress out of servicing my car. Very flexible approach to requirements and sound advise.
2/14/18,5,Was perfect and straight forward :)
2/14/18,5,On time no problems at all very efficient.
2/14/18,5,"Buying our Range Rover was a great experience from the minute we stepped through the doors until we picked up our car, great friendly staff, great coffee and biscuits and a truly great service. Thanks, keep up the good work!"
2/14/18,5,"Friendly and first-class professional service from Ben and Matt as usual.
I have been using this Audi dealership for many years."
2/14/18,5,"Routine service of my Golf SV (plus air con service) at 20K miles
Ready when promised. Discounted price from what I was quoted on booking - unexpected pleasant surprise! Also car had been washed and carpets cleaned."
2/14/18,5,Was happy with all the aspects of the service from start to finish.
2/14/18,5,Excellent service by David Johnson as per usual.
2/14/18,5,"I dealt with Michael Martin, he genuinely couldn't have made it any easier/been more helpful. As someone who isn't too knowledgeable when it comes to the car industry he made a potentially daunting experience truly enjoyable and i couldn't be happier with my results.

Would happily recommend the Mercedes Leicester branch to anyone who is looking for good products but more importantly good customer service."
2/14/18,5,"Excellent customer service, lovely staff."
2/14/18,2,"A normal poor main dealer experience from day one
Very little to say that's good tbh
All I can say is that these days, irrespective of whichever main dealer you are with consideration for the customer is non existent"
2/14/18,5,Just used the Bolton branch for service. All very professional and friendly. Kept up to date with the work (texts and video of car being checked) and completed on time. Will use again.
2/14/18,3,"A most satisfactory service, only spoiled by the lack of parking spaces to park one’s vehicle."
2/14/18,5,Always friendly & helpful.
2/14/18,5,The service depart is tops as usual
2/14/18,5,"Car was collected from my workplace, service done and returned on time and it was nice that they had washed and vacuumed it as well."
2/14/18,5,Very helpful in purchasing an approved used mini. Upfront and honest . Would highly recommend.
2/14/18,3,"This was a routine service, having dropped my car off at 8.00am it was a little off phoning at 5.30pm to find out it would be ready in 15 minutes. The service and booking were all fine, however with a £700 service perhaps I'm wrong in expecting the car to have been valeted, or at least cleaned on the exterior. But the really annoying part was to be given a loan car with less than 8 miles range on it !! not for a second thinking about fuel as it was only for a few hours to luckily 'bunny hop' into a petrol station was just not good enough.

Little things matter BMW"
2/14/18,5,i found the staff at norwich mini very good indeed coffee was superb with out asking seconds appeard the sales person named Lee was very fair with the trade in for my car;Driving the mini is quite an experiance good fun i am just about getting used to it.I have spoken to Lee on the phone a couple of times and he was still polite and freindly even after the sale to me was all done a couple of days before. So i am very pleased with the servics and staff at Norwich mini.
2/13/18,3,"I was torn between giving two stars and three, the reason being that the booking was a trial and the front facing customer service in Chester was hit and miss.

Regarding the booking in, I phoned Inchcape central booking and was promised a call back from Chester within a short time frame. Several hours later and no call back I phoned again, and again. Another couple of phone calls later and I resorted to phoning Chester direct and spoke to a General Manager; I was advised to bring the car in on Monday. As it was a battery problem and the car would need to be start assisted by recovery the General Manager advised that I would just need to bring the car in and they would get on it.

Due to the weather recovery took longer than anticipated and I finally got to Chester around 12.15. I 'booked in' at reception and gave my name and took a seat. All very polite.

After 25 minutes of just sitting there I went to the reception and said that I wanted to hand my keys in and leave the car. The reception took a note. During this whole time there was no great sense of anyone being particularly busy on the shop floor. Staff were congregating around the front desk having a chat.

5-10 minutes later an assistant came out and explained that they had been expecting the vehicle at 9.15 and as I hadn't turned up it had been classified as a 'no-show'. Details were taken. The reality was that it took 40-45 minutes to leave my car keys.

The place is big, bright and contemporary but the front facing customer interaction and service is not there.

I have no issues with the actual repair service, they ran a diagnostic, the bill was cheaper then expected, the car was cleaned inside and out, and the engineer was the only person who made me feel like a customer.

If Inchcape / Chester gave as much attention to ACTUAL customer service as they have to the creation of this glossy image they will be onto a winner."
2/13/18,3,"Well, I'm going to review Hunters Norwich BEFORE I purchase the car.
Why? Well, there are some pretty bad reviews about them on here, so I plan to make this a multi-part review and I WILL name names!
The review will be the experiences I am having now, pre-sales, on the day, after sales, and customer service (should it be required). Rating will change as I go along and is currently on average.
So, off we go then.

We found the car with them and they are a long way away from us, but the car ticks all the boxes we were looking for.
Sales person Daniel (let's keep surnames out).
Really nice chap, seems very honest and has no problem answering my questions. Not too pushy either which is a relief these days.
The last two prestige brand cars we have purchased were delivered to us by a rival dealership. We sent photos of our car and filled out schedules of condition. Then, the car we purchased was delivered and ours taken away. This works for us as we are extremely busy running a small business from home.
However, Hunters don't offer this service, so we have to drive over there, getting on for 175 miles.

Saturday is booked for collection, so possibly Saturday will see the next update.

Update 19th Feb 2018
Well, we visited Hunters and met with our salesman Daniel and he was really helpful. But you get that normally right? Before they take your money etc....
This was a bit different though. Somehow more personal. And I don't think it was due to this previous partial review. I genuinely believed he wanted us to be happy there, that day, and ongoing.
I was a great experience. And Daniel is really knowledgable and a nice chap to deal with.
The car is everything we could have expected and everything we were promised. We do have one small, and it is a very small issue that Daniel is dealing with for us. And I have no reason to believe tha this will nto be resolved very quickly. It's just a parcel shelf problem. Nothing major at all.
So, we are going up a star.
I did send a long and detailed email to you as requested. (We received no repoonse).This email would explain why we were so apprehensive and why we have decided to do such a detailed and honest review. No lies here. If it's not good we will say it's not. If it is, expect honest praise.
So far, it is good.

Update 22/2/2018
Sadly, we are going down a star. Reason: I don't belive the 165 point check is as meticulous as Landrover would have us believe it is. I did query it and was assured that it was all done correctly. However, proof is in the pudding so thay say. First off, there were several items ticked that the car didn't have and some unticked that it did have. One that it did have that wasn't ticked was the surround cameras. Not checked? Obviously not as the two front one's need laser surgery. Nothing is visible from them. It's on the list but wasn't ticked.
The parcel shelf has the wrong strings on so it can't be attached to the tailgate. Not much of a problem there as our salesman has ordered replcement ones for me. I'll go back up a star when they arrive and the cameras have been fixed under warranty."
2/13/18,5,Excellent customer service. Jason was extremely helpful and professional. I would recommend this company to anyone.
2/13/18,5,"The whole experience dealing with the audi dealership was great. The sales representative was extremely helpful and communicated exceptionally well, returning calls and emails almost immediately.

I would highly recommend the dealership, having travelled over 260 miles for a car I wanted, I feel it was all worth it for the service I received."
2/13/18,5,First class customer experience living up to the BMW Brand
2/13/18,2,Had a full service recently and wasn't too impressed. Told me the car had been valeted but it wasn't. Still had fingerprints on the boot from road dirt.
2/13/18,2,"I have used inchcape in Botley and its previous site since 2000. This will be my last visit. This visit was just for an MOT, I was waiting for 2 hours and 20 minutes, I have waited less for a major service? Generally I am kept abreast of proceedings throughout the visit, not a murmur. My car was back in the car park washed and ready for 30 minutes, I asked how much longer it would be, only then did things start moving!
The waiting area was in an extremely poor state, with dirty cups filling the trolley and spilling over onto the counter, this remained for over an hour before someone decided to clear up. Not sure what is happening but I think I will find another dealer for my next service."
2/13/18,5,"The sales rep who looked after me at mini Sunderland went above and beyond! Nothing was too much and he helped me find the best deal for me which was in fact even better than i had thought possible! Nothing was too much trouble, test drove 2 cars before making my choice! Would highly recommend!"
2/13/18,5,Very user-friendly and not long to wait at both ends of service day.
2/13/18,5,"Livvy and Jo couldn't do enough to make the service experience a fantastic one, from start to finish. Thank you both."

2/13/18,5,"Helpful, friendly and efficient."
2/13/18,5,"My car was picked up and returned to me after its annual MOT and service. Beforehand I was rung to arrange a collection time, and during the service Adam, the service manager, kept in touch about a nail in one if my tyres and its consequences. A matching replacement was procured for the next day at an acceptable price and my car returned in good order.. a"
2/13/18,4,"Spoke to James and he was very polite and helpful and was very good to me 10/10

The only problem I got is that the car was there all day and they said they fixed the problem and it is still juddering through the gearbox,23000 miles and shouldn’t be doing it."
2/13/18,5,I would like to thank all at HA Fox Derby for their attention to detail with regard to my recent XF Purchase. This is the second time I have bought through HA fox and have no hesitation in recommending or using them for a third time.
2/13/18,5,Great service from the team as ever. MOT fully completed whilst I waited in the quiet rest area and car came back clean and fresh
2/13/18,5,Excellent service as expected from Audi and Inchcape . Very helpful and informative service advisor
2/13/18,4,"Annoyed that I have to take car back for change of break fluid, rather than it all being done in one go. This causes extra inconvenience when already busy."
2/13/18,5,"Have been using MB (Inchcape) in Stratford for the last few years , the all round service they offer is excellent. They listen to what you have to say and act on it. They do what they say they are going to do professionally and consistently. I simply cannot fault them , from the moment you arrive to drop off your car to have it serviced to the point of picking up your car , with the necessary communication in between.

Simply first class customer service."
2/13/18,5,"Efficient, good communication, keep you informed."

2/13/18,5,All done as requested. Many thanks
2/13/18,3,My car was booked in at 10.45 for an mot I was waiting for it and was informed it would take approx 40 mins. At 11.30 my car was still where I had parked it I asked why my car had been left in car park for three quarters of an hour reply was they are taking it into workshop now. I finally got my keys 2 hours later without an apology for the long no wait. I asked why I had to wait so long then the apology came with reply sorry but the appointment system had double booked. ?? Total incompetence and I was late for an appointment . Just not good enough. I have used this garage several times and spent a lot of money so will give it the benefit of doubt this once xxx
2/13/18,5,I was very happy with the customer service. Definitely would recommend this company. Thank you
2/13/18,5,"My car broke down about 10miles from Banstead and was taken there, within 2 days I managed to get a lovely courtesy car which was shortly followed by my car back.

Staff were polite and friendly and pretty much did what was expected of them customer service wise."

2/13/18,1,"I'm not normally one to write a negative review. However this has been my worst experience ever with awful or non existent customer service.
It's an honest and fairly long review of Cooper BMW (Teeside)

It started last year (2017) in November through car wow. I contacted their car wow 'specialist' for a price on a BMW X1, the price was good with an 'approx' px valuation on an existing car agreed subject to viewing and being A1. In no way would I expect this to be set in stone and obviously subject to viewing, the prices quoted were however specific for poor, average and good, and living 150 miles away we couldnt really pop down to show them. Anyway the X1 in question was a vehicle in group stock with an approx 10 day delivery timeline. Happy with the prices I placed a deposit to 'secure' the car. I also received a finance quotation based on the excellent 1.9% BMW offer at the time. With the px indicated price included. Happy bunny! I have purchased vehicles this way before many many many times without issue.

However this was where the problems started. The Coopers BMW car wow specialist then put me in touch with the salesman at the branch. The first thing he said was we will provide you with a quotation for your px and a px price. This is where the alarm bells started to ring as there is obviously little communication between the various working parts in the group, you can see what's coming, as I then received a valuation on the px (subject to viewing of course) of £1300.00 less. . The salesman said pop the car down ""we'll take a look""! Yes I'll do a 300 mile round trip to be told it's worth 1300 less than you first offered! Actually I won't!
He then went on holiday and seemingly failed to pass any info to his colleagues. I declined the above and very politely asked for a full refund.

To clarify I have had no issue with car wow, I have always found this an excellent way to get a good price on a new vehicle. And the vehicle I eventually purchased from elsewhere was heavily discounted (14%) and bought through car wow.

I heard nothing for a while and then finally a response saying my car was on the way! I pointed out I had cancelled it, the response was then ""due to our internal error on the pricing we can now offer you the full px price initially agreed"". Again I politely said no thank you I have found another car, full refund please! Its not rocket science!

I found another vehicle with a discount close to 14% from Ocean BMW
Plymouth with the same 1.9% finance, and a slightly better px price than originally agreed with Cooper BMW Teeside.
I placed another deposit with Ocean Plymouth, again for a car that was promised in around 10 working days. Im aware of the reality with BMW stock and it actually took nearly 6 weeks to arrive, however Ocean were superb and honoured both the finance and the px price without any quibble.
Anyway back to Cooper BMW (Teeside) . I write this nearly 3 months later and I have only just received a refund! Despite contacting them several times by email and by phone, we eventually got to 'we have no record of your deposit' !!!!! Really!?? 'Do you have a reply from us saying received?!!' Err no strangely nothing! Your salesman went on holiday and failed to hand anything over.

Despite me checking this with my bank (sent by bacs transfer) and confirming with a £1.00 payment a few days ago. The fact that the payment had gone to them and using the bank details they had supplied. However I was now in touch with their retail sales manager so expected an immediate resolution. Err Wrong! he clearly didn't understand he concept of a bacs transfer.
A few curt emails later, no apology, nothing, i finally get an e mail saying ""I can confirm that I have allocated the money to be refunded today"" (26th Jan 2018) I finally received a £501.00 refund (not today) actually on the 31st January 2018.

So to sum up a catalogue of errors from all staff. I would be very wary of dealing with Cooper BMW Teeside based on my experience. I can of course accept an error, just not so many errors from so many people within the group. This was all in stark contrast to Ocean BMW who were outstanding in all areas."
2/13/18,5,"We purchased two vehicles on Friday and it was a very long process going through all the paperwork,but when they got round to taxing my car the system at the dvla was down and I couldn’t drive my car home which was very disappointing but the salesman Craig Peacock loaned me his car to drive home ( which by the way is Stourbridge about 60 mls away ! ) and he delivered my car later that night about 7.45 and had to drive back to chesterfield to get home ! We think this was way beyond his call of duty and can’t praise him enough , well done Craig!!"
2/13/18,5,We always go back to Inchcape for our cars because the guys are really friendly and helpful. And those in the service department - in particular Frank - are lovely too!
2/13/18,5,Very friendly and efficient company to deal with.
2/13/18,5,Very helpful staff we called in on the off-chance to have our wiper blades replaced. Nothing was too much trouble the reception rang the parts department who came up with the wiper blades and fitted them all we sat and had a coffee. The young lady from parts department was very helpful and fitted them in about five minutes. Thank you.
2/12/18,5,"BMW COOPER NORWICH
Thrilled with our new BMW. All staff polite and cheerful . No pushy salesmen, just keen to make sure you make the right choice and that they deliver to expectations, which they did. Made us feel our custom was valued. Hot chocolate really good. Whole experience was very personal and made to feel they cared. Definately recommend this dealership, others should take note. Special thank you to Colin Chandler and co for my birthday suprise"
2/12/18,5,"JCW mini convertible 1.6-211.
Purchased from Cooper Mini tonbridge wells.

Very pleased with the vehicle.
Handover and dealing with Inchcape,finance and dealership very easy and straightforward. Staff were very helpful.
No issues from start to finish.
My wife & I are very pleased with the service we received and would not hesitate in using this dealership again.
Best wishes."
2/12/18,5,"We had some very simple questions to ask, we didn't know what we wanted but the car reps were patient and took the time to listen. We didn't feel pressured at all and we left informed and with a better understanding of what we were after. Eventually we returned to buy the car we felt suited our lifestyle."
2/12/18,5,Friendly staff and easy to deal with at cooper BMW Durham
2/12/18,5,Excellent service from the moment I entered the door to the moment I picked up my car. Very professional service and kept me up to date throughout.

2/12/18,4,"Excellent service, just not expecting the price"
2/11/18,5,Top Service Will Visit again
2/11/18,5,"We were happy all along with the advice we received from the Croydon showroom and the enthusiasm and attention that we received. And very impressed by our test drive and the way that the features of the Mini were pointed out to us. The old car we had was very different including not having the stop-start facility and with the old car it was a case of putting the key in the ignition. The changes were shown to us clearly and our sales person understood our needs.

When we approached Mini Showroom to come in to help us choose there was an excellent response."
2/11/18,3,"Normally BMW TD have been excellent over the years. However, the one time that I ask for my car to be ready slightly earlier at 4pm (having dropped off first thing) it wasn't and I sat in reception for an hour watching 5 customers pick up their cars from being serviced ahead of me. Highly frustrating, it meant an embarrassing and stressful time to rearrange childcare and to date I have had to leave a message on their website to receive an apology from the manager but since no explanation about what went wrong or any offer of goodwill to feel like a valued and loyal customer."
2/11/18,5,Overall very good customer service
2/11/18,5,"The collection and return of my car was good, they kept me up to date during the day and the paperwork was completed."
2/11/18,5,Been twice recently. Once to get replacement key battery. This was produced and fitted quickly and free of charge More recently for three wiper blades for A Series. Quite a long wait to be attended to which is often the case. Blades are easy to fit but just a little bit expensive and one still slightly squeaking. Hope it will bed in.
2/11/18,5,Excellent service.
2/10/18,5,Had great service from BMW Cooper in Reading. Really impressed with their communication and personalised videos of them checking my car.
2/10/18,5,Brilliant service .If you would like looking after .Ask for tony jones
2/10/18,5,"I was booked in for new rear brake pads at Hunters Land Rover in Chester on Feb. 8th this year and the service was excellent as usual. I was greeted with a friendly receptionist who took me to Kevin Bobbett who was waiting for me at 08.15 hours. The paperwork was ready which I signed and I was out within a couple of minutes. I asked for the vehicle to be ready for 1.00 pm which it was although I had to get the bus into Chester and did not arrive until 1.45 pm. Kevin had no customers with him so I was looked after straight away and the cost of the work was exactly what I had been quoted back in September. The car had been vacuumed and washed and Kevin was very helpful and took me out to show me where my car was parked.
I will be back to Hunters in June for my annual service and I am sure I will receive the usual high level of customer service that I have now become accustomed to. Thanks Kevin."
2/10/18,5,The problem that I had was handled and resolved in a very professional manner with minimal fuss and disruption to my time.
2/10/18,5,"Buying our use TT was a pleasant experience and Steve Chuck, our salesman was very courteous and helpful."

2/10/18,5,"Great service as usual,looked after really well, would recommend Mini Cooper to anyone."
2/10/18,1,Took out tire insurance with car purchase in September 2016. When I needed to make a claim in January of this year found that cooperbmw teesside had failed to register the policy. Six weeks on and despite numerous phone calls and emails to both the dealership and insurance company this is yet to be resolved. Truly terrible customer service.
2/9/18,5,"Amazing service, big thank you for all the job carried to my car, thanks Michael for all your patience and all your time dedicated. Thank you tetbury audi , see you next time"
2/9/18,5,"This is like car servicing should be! Firstly it’s easy to park, then the showroom is immaculate, the staff make you feel welcome and valued, the business lounge is a great place to hang out - and at the end your car is returned immaculately clean!"
2/9/18,5,Great service overall. I couldn’t fault the team.
2/9/18,5,"I bought an approved used Audi A1 from Macclesfield Audi, from the first moment I made a telephone call to inquire about the car, I feel happy speaking to the sales man Adrian Ball. I when over to visit to see the car and talk facts and figures. I was welcomed like I never been at any other dealerships with manners and friendly ways from all at the dealership. I was so happy that Adrian was dealing with me because it made the sale a pleasure. Which I can say I never had that experience ever buying new or used before. Service to detail is 100% and would recommend any body buying a new or used Audi to go to Macclesfield Audi.
I definitely will be changing my other car for a new Audi. And will be happy to do business with Adrian, as he is really like a good friend when he dealing with you, not like others who just want you to sign on the line.

Thanx for my Audi"
2/9/18,5,"Inchcape staff very helpful when flat battery needed charging. Provided lift back home. I asked if they could do a service at the same time while it was there as one was due. The next day was fully booked but said they would ring if any cancellation which they did. Did the service providing details on paper not only of that but other items which needed attention (wiper replacements) but no pressure to do extras. All phone calls and contacts prompt, helpful and kept me fully informed."
2/9/18,5,Arrived with my car at Coopers Colchester at the appointed time for its first service. I was welcomed at the door by a gentleman who greeted me by name (never met him before) - he had seen me park my car on the car park and checked the registration against the list of customers expected - a very nice touch. I had elected to wait for my car whilst the service was carried out (estimated 90 mins). Offered coffee in a comfortable waiting room and the car was returned to me on time and washed. Excellent service from Coopers all round.
2/9/18,3,"My courtesy car wasn't ready and I had to wait in the cold for it to be fetched.
I reviewed my service email which was read incorrectly and the team thought I wanted a air con service even though I hadn't approved it. All was resolved with a phone call."
2/9/18,2,"Sadly I wasn't overly impressed when using Inchcape in Swindon for my Polo's 20,000 mile service. I was offered the use of a courtesy car when booking the service and was told to bring my driving license and National Insurance number. The day before the service I responded to a voicemail that I received telling me to also bring my car insurance. I contacted Inchcape and was told i didn't have the required cover (fully comp for my vehicle and third party for any other I may drive) but I could pay £15 to still use the courtesy car. Needless to say I declined using the car. I only needed it to get home and return to the garage....therefore too expensive. This changed the time I was bringing my car in and I requested a lift home which was accepted. When I brought my car in I was told to wait in a seated area before having a lift home. After waiting forty minutes I asked how long I would have to wait and was told that the driver had left without me. A lift was found from a worker who was willing to take me home.
My main gripe is about communication. If I had been told the correct and full information about using a courtesy car I would have declined the offer straightaway because I thought £15 was unacceptable. Also I was told the driver who left without me didn't have my name on his list, which wasn't his fault, but surely this should have been checked first thing in the morning as my wanting a lift changed at around 10 to 5 in the afternoon.
It made for a thoroughly miserable experience. Which is a shame because I usually get very professional service there. Maybe it was just an off day, I know it was for me!!"
2/9/18,5,Very knowledgeable and pleasant staff
2/9/18,4,A superb and efficient service with personal help fro Neil Dade which was greatly appreciated.

2/9/18,5,"Apart from being delighted with my new S350 AMG line, I have to make a special mention regarding the service I that I received from Mercedes Benz Warrington, another special word for the salesman Martin Tickle, He was so helpful during the whole purchase process."
2/9/18,5,Excellent service both pre and post sale from Errald. Thanks very much
2/9/18,5,Car was serviced as advised- informative video sent - loan car was available - my car was also valeted -
2/9/18,5,"Good experience,shame about the cost of servicing,maintenance."
2/9/18,5,"A great dealership the service staff are all friendly and helpful, even allowing me to work whilst I waited for my car to be serviced"
2/9/18,1,"The service on my car was fine. However I was truly disappointed in the staff service! 1 member of staff in particular, James. I received a call at 12pm telling me my car was ready for collection, I turned up at 1:45 and didn’t get my keys until 2:10! Apparently it wasn’t ready after all! When I handed over my keys I asked if certain key rings would need to be removed, he said no it’s fine. However when I got my car back 2 keyrings were missing! I didn’t notice until I had left, however and tried 3 times to call. On the third time I got through eventually, and the lady told me I’d have to come all the way back as she was in an office upstairs and that’s not her department! Incredibly rude! When I did return James told me that there were no keyrings on the keys and had I checked at home! I didn’t care about my trolley one, however I had an elephant key ring which was quite special to me and I needed it back! Eventually he went to look and found only the elephant."
2/9/18,5,Michelle was very professional and a joy to deal with.Our Mini was serviced and we were looked after really well Five Stars Michelle Stan and Yvonne Ayre
2/9/18,5,Very happy with the service provided
2/9/18,5,"Straightforward , helpful , no pressure , friendly but business like - Jason particularly helpful and pleasant to deal with.

As a general comment the company could cut down on the procedures and questions which seem to benefit them more than the customer."
2/9/18,1,"""You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious."" This maybe a classic quote from the film Star Wars but it should also be used as a warning to anybody considering using VW Inchcape Southend.

They may have a nice big dealership for you to sit in and offer you coffee and fake smiles as you go in. But this cant hide the fact that the people working there and the senior managers especially, are just going through the motions and they have absolutely no interest in you as a customer after you have given them your money.

My advice to anyone considering purchasing a new car or getting your car serviced is to avoid this place like the plague. It should be shut down by trading standards. You have all the stereotypical slimey pathological lying salesman/service staff and their equally vile managers all following the same totally dishonest script. Its rotten to the core and its a company that has absolutely no sincerity or integrity whatsoever.

I wont bore people with the full details of what occurred as I will be here typing all day, but please don't be fooled. In the event a problem occurs, they really don't give a toss about their customers and will do just about anything to wash there hands of your problems. Pease don't make the same mistake I did by thinking you are paying for peace of mind by visiting a main dealer. You may as well visit Arthur Daley's car lot.

I will now wait with bated breath for the same pathetic generic templated response from someone at Inchcape, pretending to show they care about the negative review and asking me to contact them to discuss it further. Please don't waste your time, I would rather boil my own ball sack."
2/9/18,5,Good efficient service provided. All aspects of my Audi service completed as agreed and on time. Friendly helpful staff. Very pleased.
2/9/18,5,Excellent service as always.Expensive but you get what you pay for!
2/9/18,5,Very efficient service. I waited whilst my car was MOT'd in the comfortable waiting lounge with a complimentary coffee and newspaper. It wasn't long until my immaculately cleaned car was ready.
2/9/18,5,"All very well arranged. Useful reminder call the day before from Eve with up to date and accurate information about traffic situation reaching your site.

Service and minor work on fuel filler flap release carried out painlessly. Park and ride ticket welcome and system worked well.

A tiny piece of fine tuning. Although we took delivery of out Golf at the start of March I think that it came into the country before Christmas 2016. This meant that the “oil service due” warning came up very early. It surely cannot be difficult to reset this to a date appropriate to the date of collection."
2/9/18,5,"Excellent customer service!

Rock star service. Text contact confirming they had started work on my car, video health check on my car and text when my car was ready for collection.
My car was valeted and parked at the front. Perfect!"
2/9/18,5,"Work carried out efficiently, staff in the dealership polite and helpful."
2/9/18,5,Absolutely first class service throughout from the moment I arrived until I collected my car later in the day.
2/9/18,5,Excellent Service
2/8/18,5,"The Service desk was manned by a pleasant and professional lady, who was very diligent in recommending and organising the correct service. Our service advisor for the day was Charlotte."
2/8/18,5,"Where do I start ?

I did my homework on a 335d xDrive Tourer and began the process of emailing around dealers in the UK to enquire what was in stock.

Some never replied, some replied 5 days later, but Amir from BMW Cooper York emailed on the day and answered all my queries in detail. Amir emailed everything that I requested so it made my decision easy. Communication with Amir was professional at all times and his replies to my queries were punctual.

When I arrived to view the vehicle there was issue and Amir handled it very well, so much so that I agreed to purchase the vehicle in the middle of the test drive.

I arrived at 10am and some hours later I left the showroom with the vehicle. Amir did a very good crossover with regards to outlining the spec and equipment, so much so that he paired my phone with the system and programed my homeword journey into the Sat-Nav.

My dealings throughout the purchase with Amir in sales and Paul in parts was a real pleasure. They were both professional to the letter and I would have no hesitation in recommending BMW Coopers York, and would recommend that you request Amir as your sales exec.

Great to see good dealers whom make quality client service a priority.

Well done BMW Cooper York on having great stock, and superb staff !!"
2/8/18,5,Excellent and fast service was able to sit and wait in comfortable surroundings
2/8/18,5,"Lexus is an up market brand and the service centre reflects that, but without being stuffy.

The service ethos reflects the cars - they work and work well without being flashy or condescending. I arrived at the appointed time and was expected, they listened to my special requests, the paperwork was kept to a minimum, and the same on collection. The car was ready on time, the paperwork explained and I was charged what I had been quoted."
2/8/18,5,"Very helpful & polite staff they explain all the problems with the vehicle in great detail.I would highly recommend this company.they even video the faults with your vehicle so you can see & hear the problems fully explained
By the technician,so you you know exactly what is wrong. MR D.WHITE."
2/8/18,5,"I travel 40 miles to Stockton rather than use Mini dealerships in Newcastle. This is because I find Cooper Mini Teesside give better part exchanges, are more honest and you don't have to deal with sales talk. They are also very happy to deal with any issues which may arise until the customer is completely satisfied."
2/8/18,5,"great experience

Good customer service the video is a great idea."
2/8/18,5,"Fantastic service as always from VW Stockport, car collected and delivered home by the wonderful Dave, who was a delight as always, so friendly and professional.

2/8/18,5,"Excellent service, kept well informed. would use again."
2/8/18,1,"Not impressed with this place at all, took my car in for an MOT and brake pads, they said I needed to replace my suspension and charged me £1500. Got the car back and the suspension was not working at all, it had been fine before they'd ""fixed"" it. Took it back in and got charged another £500 to fix the problem they had caused!"
2/8/18,5,"My VW Passat Estate was booked in to have a small problem checked out. This was quickly resolved and clearly explained to me why it had occurred.

All the staff were prompt and courteous with their service and attentiveness.

The premises were clean and ordered and all looked well organised.
The car was returned all washed, valeted and all paperwork completed.

I would be happy to recommend this dealership to anyone."

All the staff were very polite , helpful and welcoming.
The sales team are very imformative and nothing too much trouble.
I would recommend Audi Stockport to anyone."
2/8/18,2,"The Loughborough branch are professional, polite and always ensure the customer is catered for"
2/8/18,2,"I hate contact with Mercedes-Benz of Derby - they think they are so smart with comfy areas and no service desk but they forget the most basic thing - its so rude to keep you waiting - and every time I go there, they keep me waiting."
2/8/18,5,"Car service: professional, polite and efficient"
2/8/18,5,"Found the whole process for our service simple, personable and efficient.
Had explained the costs for each element and everything promised to be done was done.
Found it amusing that the service assistant commented that he wonders why the car is valet before being taken out for a test drive as the car did come back slightly dirty. Did not concern me as they car would be used and get dirty anyway."
2/8/18,5,"From start to finish brought my bmw1 series the service and salesman Nigel was excellent would recommend them to anyone ,I will be going back for my next car ."
2/8/18,5,All went well and efficiently
2/8/18,5,Excellent in every way
2/8/18,5,"Pleasure to deal with from start to finish, friendly staff and no hanging around"
2/8/18,5,Took my mini in for a free health check expecting a large bill over brakes and was really well looked after and found out no works needed so no charge.
2/8/18,1,"Very friendly but unable to help at time, blamed computer down. Left him with description of part. Having contacted me and stated he had the part charged me and mailed out the wrong parts.
Great service"
2/8/18,5,"fantastic service as usual I was kept informed of progress each step of the way and staff were very friendly and informative, very helpful."
2/8/18,5,"Overall very good experience dealing with Audi Crawley, I had never purchased a vehicle from a main dealer but was introduced to Max and he dealt with me very professionally and made my experience of buying a used approved Audi very welcoming and can say I would happily purchase another vehicle from them. Once again thank you Max for all your help. The Mrs is loving the new car.
Kind regards"
2/8/18,5,A great experience with helpful staff and a good knowledge level meant a good outcome for my service. would definitely use again
2/8/18,5,"All staff were courteous and professional, Simon answered any questions asked about the work carried out during servicing of my vehicle."

Thanks, Dave."
2/8/18,5,"Great service, car was ready and washed when required. John was very helpful on service."
2/8/18,5,"Excellent service and help, top marks"
2/8/18,4,"Very good with attentive staff.
My only complaint is that they are on expensive side. I could get what they offer cheaper if I was not tied into there deal."
2/8/18,5,"Cooper Malton Mini always welcoming. Holly on reception is very personable and an asset to the business. Transactions are very smooth and effortless. Timings of drop off and collection flexible and completion of work has always been accurate. Good communications - phone call to inform as soon as service completed. Car cleaned inside and out.
One request: More information of all actual work carried out for the service would be helpful for records"
2/8/18,3,The service was as planned and I had a great new feature where BMW showed a video of my car. The only downside was the feeling that I was being rushed out the door when I came to get my car. I also had to hunt around for it in the car park and wasn't told where it had been left. Car was washed but I think it may have been hurried.
2/8/18,5,Excellent service - Naim was incredibly professional
2/8/18,4,"Liked the video overview of the service. Pleased car was cleaned and vacuumed. Was disappointed that my screen wash wasn't topped as it usual is. The washer fluid warning came on as I drove home that night, which is a little annoying after a service. (This might be a Lease Company decision).
Didn't manage to solve one of the problems this visited, but Customer Service Rep was keen to get it booked back in for a second time - which is good. Now booked in for W/C 26th Feb, courtesy car arranged.
Thanks All."
2/8/18,5,great service from start to finish.
2/8/18,5,"Excellent service. Helpful staff. Sensible pricing.
Car returned clean, having been valeted."
2/8/18,5,"Great service, a couple of small issues resolved professionally."
2/8/18,5,"I had a sit and wait appointment to Service my Evoque, I ended up being late for the appointment (due to motorway traffic), but they ensured that it didn't cause an issue to the work being done, myself or any other customers. I work on a the road as an Area Manager and had my laptop with me to catch up with Admin work, I was kindly provided with a desk and power points so I could work for the entirety of the time I was at the Dealership. Was offered coffee/tea and refreshments for the whole of my time also which was greatly appreciated...."
2/8/18,5,"Service was fast, polite and informative and I had a new mini in the exact spec and colour within 5 days!"
2/7/18,5,MOT booked and completed in a timely manner. No delays at all. Was kept informed via text and online video. Good price. No complaints at all.
2/7/18,5,Well organised and efficient. Lucy sorted out my error in making a booking and ensured my car received the service that I wanted. Great to sort this and extremely satisfied
2/7/18,5,"Excellent service, highly recommended and will always use in future."
2/7/18,4,"Everything was good, very polite, very helpful and efficient.
My one small complaint is i always have a loan car and always request an automatic but every time they have a manual for me and i have to wait for one to be sorted out and paper work done,"
2/7/18,5,"As always excellent service from mini. Took car in for new break pads while I waited. Good facilities meant I sat in private booth to work and was provided with constant flow of coffee! All staff very friendly and professional and were patient explaining requirements to me. It's definitely a case of a mini adventure when visiting any branch and it's one of the reasons I will stick with a mini (as well as my great love for the car itself!) - customer service is a definite factor for me when buying anything and they have got their customer service spot on.
Nicky, proud owner of mini cooper convertible :)"
2/7/18,5,"We received thorough , friendly and conscientious attention from Gary before , during and after our test drive in our smooth and impressive Audi A4. I was filled with trepidation initially at the prospect of driving it as I had never before driven an automatic ( this was an s-tronic !) Many thanks to both Gary and Danny . Our experiences thus far will lead us to heartily recommend Hyde Audi .
Treflyn and Ann Jones ,
Porthmadog , Gwynedd"
2/7/18,2,"The service adviser needs to be trained in proper customer service.
Showed no interest in her job."
2/7/18,5,Excellent communication from booking on the phone to collecting the car after its service on the day. Won’t hesitate in taking my car back for its next service.
2/7/18,5,"Excellent service. On time, clear reporting, guidance for future servicing, and a good price. Well done."
2/7/18,5,Great customer service. Sue is especially helpful.
2/7/18,1,"Utterly underwhelming experiencing buying our new car; Million miles away from Mini, our last new car. 'Imprecise' with the actual cost eventually invoiced of extras that were supposed to have been part of the deal we agreed. Could go on, but what's the point ...wouldn't go back."
2/7/18,2,The dealership seems incapable of delivering a car back on time. Once having forgotten to service or MOT my car having had it all day.
2/7/18,4,"Sorted. Great job servicing my Mini Cooper.
Thank you to Mark and the team.
Jacinta Jones"
2/7/18,4,"Great help once again from service representative Leah-Anna Lawrence. Hassle free and warm attitude as always.

My past experience from this dealer service team is that they just sort out the problem with no hassle. Not always a warm vibe (usualy looking very busy) but always get the job done and to the customer benefit.

Have had experience with parts team previous and the attitude is not so great which is why score had to be a 4* instead of 5. Cannot comment on other deperatments."
2/7/18,4,"Southport Garage

Dealt with David Rubin. At first we were annoyed by the advice given in relation to the finance deal as it turned out to be different from what was originally quoted,. After some bickering on both sides and speaking to the manager Sam, the issue was resolved and we were happy with what was agreed. From that moment everything went smoothly and we were quite happy with the deal and the way we were treat. David and Sam turned out to be quite helpful and we left the garage as happy customers."
2/7/18,5,Fantastic service ! And a special thanks to Danny for keeping me updated throughout he service.
2/7/18,5,"Very friendly staff, arrived to drop off vehicle for a service, once it was discovered that I had a long drive home they were very accommodating in changing me from having a courtesy car to a slot that would only take 1hr 30 mins so I could wait for my car. This not only made my day less stressful with hours of driving but also saved me the cost of the rental car. Throughout my wait I was kept informed of progress and well looked after with hot drinks."
2/7/18,5,Amber could not have been more helpful and polite. Only one point the loan car only had enough fuel for a range of 13 miles when handed over to me so I was out of pocket as I could not return it this low on fuel.
2/7/18,5,"Once again, Cooper Tonbridge Mini have exceeded expectations, and I would have no hesitation in recommending this company to anyone."
2/7/18,5,"Graham Hall's attention to detail was second to none. Walked me through the replacement new car process clearly and easily, and made the process of replacing my car tremendously simple. My second new car from Cooper Tunbridge Wells, and can not recommend them highly enough. Thank you to Graham, and the rest of the team for such great service."
2/7/18,2,The car went in for a service and with 3 problems to be resolved. I got charged for plugging it into a diagnostic machine that another dealership tells me is done as a matter of course when they receive a vehicle. No record can be found for the source of two of the problem but I am informed they have fixed the 3rd. I pay and the vehicle is returned with the driver telling me that the 3rd problem still exists and he has informed the dealer. A day later and no call but they have texted to say they hope I am happy with the service I received. I think it is fair to say that this would be a NO.
2/7/18,5,Fantastic service best customer service by any garage I've delt with
2/7/18,5,Car service completed to my satisfaction - Coopers couldn't fit one replacement part on the day because they weren't happy with the colour match but rung me shortly after return of my vehicle to advise on when the part could be fitted - I chose the next day and they fitted it promptly whilst I waited.
2/7/18,5,No problems. Little items mentioned all resolved at the moment. I will still monitor the wind noise.
2/7/18,1,Went in to take my car for a service. This side was ok no issues.. however whilst waiting I thought I’d take a look at some new cars and spent around 15 minutes looking at cars upstairs not once did any sales men come up to me and ask if they could help me out. All just sat at their desks... shocking!! How do they expect to get any sales with this attitude? This is why my purchase was from another main dealer.
2/6/18,5,"Brilliant service from start to finish and a fantastic end product.
Car made and delivered on time. Cannot fault the Team at Maidstone. My sales guy Michael Taylor was excellent and knew the product he was selling perfectly, making everything easy to understand and enjoy.
Thank you."
2/6/18,5,"All good, no problems. Staff friendly and professional."
2/6/18,5,Excellent service. No complaints..
2/6/18,5,Excellent service from Coopers Banstead servicing my BMW 5 series. My car was ready on time & even kept me updated on what needs doing & returned the car washed & ready. Most helpful & polite & very efficient. Very satisfied. Thanks Banstead team
2/6/18,4,"Great experience, very efficient ... great customer service. Costs very clear, kept me informed and did what they said they would do."
2/6/18,5,"I called into Swindon Audi without an appointment to get an urgent repair, and despite not having an appointment they promptly dealt with my issue, and even performed a complementary health check on my car.

Great service from the team at Swindon, and special thanks to Laura-Jane and Joe H for the professional service during my visit."
2/6/18,5,Very well looked after - helpful mini video to demonstrate vehicle condition
2/6/18,5,As usual enjoyed my visit to inchcape stockport paul in service was excellent.
2/6/18,5,Excellent service very nice..
2/6/18,5,"Welcoming staff, very polite and good service throughout."
2/6/18,5,Quick and easy. Nice staff and a neat and tidy showroom
2/6/18,5,"I must stress this is aimed at the service department and in particular and excellent young gentleman called Tom.

Courteous; Professional; Delivered on Promises; went extra mile - Tom lived up to everything promised and would expect, managing my expectations perfectly!!! Having witnessed him make effort to meet clients (not just me) for other departments rather than walking around looking busy like most others - he exemplified what great service looks like. Always looking for the next customer - A death of fresh air and service I haven't witnessed in a long time.

Behind the scenes, the service was completed quickly and efficiently and allowed me to complete a full days work with super drop off and pick up from work.

Faultless on this occasion - Well Done all in Service, and thank you for the wash and vac - Evoque felt like new again!!!

I wish I could say similar sales departments - good job they have a great product to sell as the service is less compelling - full of promise with no substance or delivery of customer experience - what a shame you could do so much better."
2/6/18,5,"Excellent service when I had an issue with both headlights not working. Despite being busy they fitted me in and solved the problem, I felt like nothing was too much trouble and will definitely go to Hunters again."
2/6/18,5,"excellent staff they do go that extra mile for you

2/6/18,5,I took my one year old VW UP for its first service to the Inchcape VW Twickenham service centre yesterday. I was extremely impressed with the customer service which really exceeded expectations. When parking there was someone to immediately there to meet me to take the car to be washed and a valet. I was met then by Vicky who explained the whole process to me. Vicky rang me as soon as the car was ready and I was sent a video of the car with a commentary from the mechanic outlining the state of the car and if anything needed attending to - amazing! I was also given a full written statement of what had been done on the car. Excellent customer service.
2/6/18,5,"All good, nice people"
2/6/18,5,"great staff, receptionist and team on all front desks. The video health check is a great touch to show underneath car."
2/6/18,5,Staff polite and helpful and even phoned up the day before to check I was still able to make the appointment. No high pressure sales
2/6/18,1,"Terrible aftersales service from Hunters Land Rover, Preston. Upon purchasing my RR Sport I was informed that the service book had been misplaced and would be sent on to me once it had been located, this never happened! After leaving telephone and email messages over a number of months (without ever having them returned) I contacted Land Rover UK who contacted the branch. LR UK were told that as Hunters weren't sure when the service book had gone missing they wouldn't be able to assist me but I could buy a new service book for £18.50!!! Why would any person pay £33,000 for a car and not expect full service history (especially as that is how it was sold). Absolutely disgusting service.
Update on 20th February 2018. After leaving my review I was contacted by Rebecca from Inchcape offering to replace the service book. Rebecca was very helpful and sent my service record via email and followed this with a replacement book. Why this couldn't have been done originally by the branch at Preston I do not know, however Rebecca saved the day many thanks."
2/6/18,5,Excellent service as always highly recommend
2/6/18,5,After recent service I have nothing but praise for how the experience went. The service and courtesy car were booked through the 'My VW' App on my mobile phone. I had a couple of queries pertaining to the service regarding service cost and courtesy car insurance and those were dealt with effectively with politeness and efficiency. Service day went smoothly with a detailed progress report & video of my car status. Plus a Car Clean and a VW Smart Control Data Plug which links to my mobile phone regular updates on Car & Drivers Performance. First Class well done Daniel.
2/6/18,4,"overall reasonably happy with experience except i found when i went to check tyre pressures valve caps were corroded on which led me tobbeleivehow well did the multi check go!!







dissapointed that when i went to check tyre pressures valve caps were corroded on which led me to ask how well was the multi check done?"
2/5/18,2,"My car was due an oil service according to the onboard computer? When I rang the call centre to book my car in they ask for my mileage and gave me a price of £170 however, on the day of taking my car in for the service they said that that had made a mistake and that my car was due a major service and it would cost me £338. This is the second time this has happened and begs the question regarding the call centre having the correct information especially as the Audi servicing is all entered on an electronic system."
2/5/18,5,"Jake was a courteous young man and made my overall visit at Swindon Audi, very enjoyable for the short time I was there, considering that I had travelled a 140 miles"
2/5/18,5,Excellent personal service. I was kept informed every step of the day.
2/5/18,3,Car was collected. Very polite. But valet service was very poor
2/5/18,5,From reception desk to service bay all helped to make my experience of Bmw after sales as you would expect from a company of this standing in the industry
2/5/18,5,"From the ordering of our e pace jaguar to receiveing it,
The two sales people we dealt with (Tony& Martin) Tony has now left.
Were first class
Especially Martin who went through everything when we picked the car up.
He took time to make sure we New most things. Making us feel confident to drive it away"
2/5/18,5,As always excellent service from knowledgeable staff.
2/5/18,5,"Friendly, yet professional from booking to delivery of my car."
2/5/18,5,"In my Land Rover owning experience the only LR dealership I would recommend would be Inchcape UK Guildford.
From my initial purchase through to a very the high standard customer service and ongoing maintenance experience."
2/5/18,5,"Great service, made me feel valued and comfortable while waiting for MOT. Delivered fast and efficient service, thanks all, what I expect from BMW"
2/5/18,3,I was disappointed. I have the impression they are far more interested in selling cars than in the service side of the business. A decent enough basic service at a reasonable price but their mechanics were unable to resolve any of the 3 specific issues I had asked them to look at. Front of house customer service was poor with a total lack of interest in the individual customer
2/5/18,3,"Inchcape Swindon - car service
The car service itself was fine but some of the staff need Customer Service training and the facilities while you wait for your car are dreadful with uncomfortable hard chairs and a broken coffee machine. I received a call from Inchcape asking me to take my car in earlier than the arranged time. When I arrived, there was no member of staff at the service desk so I went to the main reception where the receptionist just sent me back to the service desk without making any attempt to find someone to deal with me. After an unacceptably long wait, someone finally came to book in my car during which time, the actual service receptionist arrived at her desk behind me and shouted over my head at the man dealing with me in order to converse about some machine she had fixed - totally appalling and rude behaviour. I had booked a courtesy car, but even though they had asked me to come earlier, the courtesy car was not ready so I had to wait again. On returning the courtesy car, not only was there not a single free parking bay (other than disabled), but, again, there was no-one available at the service desk and this time I had to wait even longer to be served, during which time I had the displeasure of watching the receptionist on the main desk examining her nails and swinging around on her chair. It was a relief to leave. Inchcape - you need to train your receptionists in Customer Service skills and you need to make your waiting area more comfortable. If I had been there to buy a car, I would have walked out."
2/5/18,5,"2nd service here, great , friendly team."
2/5/18,4,"Excellent service, the assistant assigned to me was excellent and really helpful."
2/5/18,5,"Always visit Cooper Teesside for my bmws service. Everything is perfect from booking in, arriving, work carried out to collection. The showroom is immaculate and all the staff are friendly, efficient and professional. Well done to all...."
2/5/18,5,excellent customer service and communication. Will definitely use again
2/5/18,5,"Excellent service
The issues with the car were diagnosed very quickly, i was kept update with the progress of the repairs.
the car was returned to me earlier than i had expected it had also been cleaned inside and out."
2/5/18,4,"Booked my car in for an MOT with Cooper BMW Cobham and have been really impressed with the service I received. The online booking system did not provide me with a confirmation of the booking so I contacted them directly and they booked me in straight away. When I dropped the car off, there was a person outside marking cars coming in from the bookings list who then directed me to the service reception upstairs. Their is a service receptionist directly in front of you who then provides your advisor's name who will be assisting you. Sam, the advisor handled all the necessaries. On collection of the car, received a video of the healthcheck report that they do for all cars, showing tyre wear etc. The only critisism that I can say is that they advised that the tyres on the car were the same brand all round which I knew they weren't. A small attention to detail item but will be booking my car in two months time with them for my next service."
2/5/18,5,Friendly and knowledgable staff.
2/5/18,5,Quick and Fast service
2/5/18,4,GOOD SERVICE
2/5/18,5,"Great service from entering the building to picking up my car later in the day.
The staff on the reception desk were as usual very friendly and efficient .
Josh on service reception did a great job getting me booked in and had my loan car ready and waiting.
I was kept updated through the day and Josh had my car ready on time.
I have to return to have some work carried out under warranty and Josh explained everything about the diagnosis and the remedial action that needs to be carried out.
The most efficient and friendly service from a great team at Stockton. Well done"
2/5/18,2,After having booked my car in to have a problem looked at and arranged a courtesy car my partner turned up to find there was not car available for him. They said that they would have sent me a text to say there were no cars but this definitely was not the case. As my partner had no way of getting to work he asked them for suggestions. They said they would have a quick look at the problem and try to rectify it while he waited. As he had to get to work for a meeting he was limited to time. They did have a quick look and did not rectify the problem. I was disgusted with the service and the fact that they didn't really appear to care. I would not recommend them to any one. I am still left with the problem and have no desire to return to get it sorted as they are unreliable.
2/4/18,5,Very friendly and efficient service
2/4/18,5,Great service from all staff
2/4/18,5,I gave Cooper BMW 5* for their efficiency & the helpfulness of Emma Sanderson on the service desk.
2/4/18,5,Great service
2/4/18,5,"The team at Inchcape Warrington were very professional, efficient and friendly from the start of making the booking for a service and MOT, to a warm welcome from reception staff whilst dropping the vehicle off and to keeping me up-to-date on developments through the day. I received an email detailing the service report, a short video and a telephone call informing me the car was ready for collection. Great customer service on collection, and a gleaming car which is now in tip top condition, runs smoothly and also benefitted from a much needed valet inside and out. Great job."
2/4/18,5,"The servicing of my Golf R was carried out without any problems whatsoever. Dean Luke handled the matter professionally and was very courteous. The car was ready by the time I requested and was returned to me washed and cleaned. I was given a discount on the quoted price, which was unexpected but gratefully accepted. I have no hesitation in recommending Inchcape Stockport for servicing."
2/3/18,5,"We've recently bought Toyota CHR from Sandhurst branch and the experience of customer service couldn't be better. I need to mention Neil who was so professional, friendly and helpful from the beginning of the process till the end. He was keen to answer all questions and kept us informed every step of the way. Couldn't recommend this branch more. Very very happy loving my new car. Thank you"
2/3/18,4,"Sales team were all busy when we called in so we had to wait approximately 20 minutes. Good service for rest of that visit. Arranged for test drive the following day, but despite waiting for an hour they were unable to get the car out of the showroom because various car's batteries were flat. Wasted the whole of the afternoon. Successful test drive completed the next day. Rest of visit, including collection of the car was good, though a little surprised no compensation for wasted time offered!"
2/3/18,5,"The salesman, Robert, was extremely helpful in sourcing the right car for me and didn’t just try to sell what was on the forecourt. After much deliberating I decided on an Evoque, some paperwork was completed and within the week everything was sorted.
A thorough explanation of the car was given after which I drove away with my new car. A very relaxed car buying experience and I would definitely buy from Hunters again."
2/3/18,5,"From booking the car in ,to the Home collection and servicing the whole team worked with professionalism and courtesy.
Cannot fault them"
2/3/18,5,"Very knowledgable staff
Work carried out in timely manner
Pleasant sirroundings"
2/3/18,2,"My car went in to the dealer for recall on seat belts.
I delivered it at 9:45 and had to wait until 4:00 until i could collect it.
The wait was to long and i had to chase service for information."
2/3/18,5,"THANKS AGAIN TO VW BOLTON FOR ALL THE EXCELLENT HELP IN CHANGING OUR CAR.
A VERY SPECIAL THANKS SHOULD GO TO NICHOLAS WHITE WHO WAS FRIENDLY, KNOWLEDGEABLE AND SO HAPPY TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS.
LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU NEXT TIME."
2/3/18,5,"I bought my Car new from Mann Eggerton in Exeter, I always take out a Service Plan with VW which is the Cheapest Option. You might find a slightly cheaper local Garage but the Price Difference is never enough to offset the quality of the the Service, the Materials used, and the Specialist VW Knowledge. I've always had this Car serviced at Mann Eggerton with no Problems. The Staff are friendly and Courteous."
2/3/18,5,"Outstanding customer service, totally exceeded my expectation. My car went in for a major service, and I decided to test drive a couple of vehicles. By the end of the day I had upgraded my car and collected my nearly new vehicle the very next day. Superb customer care."
2/3/18,2,"My bulb warning light came on so I took my car to Inchcape on Monday. They were unable to fix it then and told me to book the car in for Thursday at 11.30. I was told I also needed a new bulb holder and the job was completed in just over 90 minutes and cost £64. I never saw the damaged bulb holder.
When my husband had a blown bulb in his Volvo he took it to the local dealer who replaced the bulb on the spot in less than 10 minutes at a total cost of £10.
Volvo win hands down on price, speed and quality of service."
2/3/18,5,Helpful and very satisfactory service with car collected and returned and cleaned.
2/3/18,5,"Really friendly , good experience, thank you i love my car!"
2/3/18,5,Very efficient and friendly service
2/3/18,5,"Very pleasant experience. Good customer service. Car was in for service (on serrvice plan). Car returned to door, serviced washed and vacuumed."
2/3/18,5,Our dealings with Nick jones the salesman at Landrover Preston was professional and friendly. He was able to source the perfect car for us quickly and efficiently.
2/3/18,5,The level of customer service provided by the team in the Stratford upon Avon branch was superb from initial enquiry to test drive and sale. I would highly recommend the branch to my family and friends.
2/3/18,5,"The level of service received was fantastic, friendly and very professional. I will certainly continue to be a customer of Inchcape and will be using them for future cars."
2/2/18,3,Only taken my car to Cooper BMW Colchester twice and on both occasions they’ve damaged one of the alloy wheels. No quibble with offering a repair but can’t be doing with this kind of carelessness. Have to find another dealer I can trust.
2/2/18,5,"I found an Ex Demonstrator Mini Cooper S All4 Countryman that Cooper of Thames Ditton had advertised on the Approved Mini system. After making contact with them and receiving a very friendly but businesslike response I decided to proceed to make a purchase from them despite residing in Yorkshire and the obvious logistical requirements. I can honestly say that from beginning to end the team at Coopers were attentive, professional and attended to every part of the enquiry and process in a timely and efficient manner. I have no hesitation in recommending them and in particular Joao Gomes. They were a pleasure to do business with."
2/2/18,5,"Dealt with Craig at Mercedes Warrington , amazing individual ,
everything he promised he delivered."
2/2/18,5,"Bought my first band new Mercedes C Class coupe from Cheshire oaks what an experience. Was dealt with by James Wake who was so helpful and nothing was too much trouble, finding me the right car and speck to a fantastic deal. I was constantly kept up to date by James of when my car was arriving and the day u picked it was was a shear joy. The icing on the cake was being shown into a private room for the reveal and wow did I feel special. James then took the time to go through everything with the car. The only downside is..... I want to do it all again. Thank you so much Cheshire Oaks team and James."
2/2/18,5,"Helpful, friendly staff. Excellent service"
2/2/18,5,Really great service - from greeting at reception to handover of my car / courtesy car. Flexible around when I could pick car up based on working hours. Cleaning my car for when I got it back was a nice touch!
2/2/18,5,"I booked at Inchcape Battersea because it makes more sense than going to Jemca at Edgware Road if you live in central London. Its much closer. I did not know about Inchcape before. Internet searches only bring up other Toyota service agents. My experience cannot be better: excellent reception, lovely approach, appropriate attention by Andre and professional service throughout. They don't have the espresso machine but is it that important? Thank you for the service and experience."
2/2/18,5,Took car in for service. All tasks carried out with no problems. Staff were great
2/2/18,3,"Was booked in for a recall to rectify identified issue. Recall completed accordingly, however when booking the car in the booking clerk offered free vehicle health check and full valet, both of which were not undertaken. Disappointed."
2/2/18,5,"Excellent service,"
2/2/18,5,"Always excellent service, from initial booking to checking in vehicle to collection after work carried out. Polite and courteous staff, all necessary work clearly explained and updated via video email attachment. All work completed on time and no unexpected additional costs.
Highly recommend!"
2/2/18,5,Always an excellent service. Very accommodating to individual needs like being able to work while they deal with your car.
2/2/18,5,Very professional and kind team. Lots of thanks.
2/2/18,5,"Only had my new (second hand) '16 reg Mercedes a couple of weeks, bought from a private dealer. Engine management light came on and they manged to squeeze me in at short notice and diagnosed a faulty sensor - doesn't stop the car running but will be fixed under warranty on my return from holiday. Excellent service as usual"
2/2/18,1,"I purchased a delivery mileage F-Pace from HA Fox Preston last year. The AWD system has failed on the car and HA Fox have shown no interest in trying to resolve the issues in an amicable way.
The vehicle is with my local Jaguar garage in the West Midlands who have had the car now for 3 weeks and expect it to take another 2 weeks for the vehicle to be repaired as it requires a complete new main body wiring harness.
HA Fox management do not respond to calls and are very arrogant in their attitude in dealing with the issue. I have escalated the issue to Inchcape and Jaguar customer services who both have a similar attitude as well.

When I purchased the car it was never PDI’d because the bonnet wouldn’t shut and a seat was damaged. On top of that they registered the car in the wrong name which took me a month to sort out with the DVLA.

The cars are sold on the façade of being a premium brand however the customer service is much worse than anything I have experienced with any other car dealer or manufacturer."
2/2/18,5,"Very friendly, contacted as soon as service completed, pleased with service and courtesy car wash."
2/2/18,5,Great customer service
2/2/18,5,"Superb experience from Cooper Banstead,
the ladies on reception were very welcoming .
Nahidul Islam my service advisor was excellent, very friendly, very informative and explained everything regarding my service. I received a video from Bob the technician which was great. Five star dealership with five star staff! Will definitely be returning !"
2/2/18,2,"Mercedes Benz Inchcape Warrington-Very poor customer service

Mercedes Benz Inchcape Warrington, customer service is sadly lacking. You arrive at the appointed time, inform the customer reception desk you have arrived and then wait and wait and wait for one of the so called Meet & Greet representatives to meet & greet you!! Sometime it's 30 minutes and while you're waiting no one apologises for the long wait. Do they not realise that their customers have appointments to make, so what is the point of making an appointment? Similarly if you need to ring the dealership to speak to a representative no one is ever available, so you leave a message for a ring back & guess what no one calls you. There is no point ringing again because the person you want to speak to is still unavailable. It's an absolute disgrace, no one cares they are only interested in taking your money."
2/2/18,5,Well recommended.
2/2/18,1,"Leased a new A4 tfsi, took in back after 4K miles as urban fuel consumption was only 23 mpg (urban) and over all 31mpg, they checked everything out and was told nothing wrong with car. I don’t drive madly and this fuel consumption is rediculous! They say in the brochure that it should do double what is being achieved. Then they pointed out the very, very small print that says car may not achieve these figures. This was NEVER pointed out by the salesman, and actually pointed out the brochure mpg predictions"
2/2/18,5,"Hello, I took my car in for a general tyre repair / fault, they fixed the problem free of charge then completed a health check and a wash and valet all for free, outstanding service. I will definitely be buying next car with them."
2/2/18,3,"Service was completed on the hour quoted and appears to have been completed satisfactorily.
My disappointment was that having bought an Inchcape demonstrater with 3400 miles on the clock and having competed a further 1600 miles I was surprised to have to pay the full price (£302) with no contribution from Mercedes. The claim that this was included in the sale price but this was not mentioned at the point of sale."
2/2/18,5,Excellent service from staff at Bromborough. Sales people very friendly without being pushy. They went out of their way to make buying our new car a pleasurable experience. They definitely deserve a 5 star rating.
2/2/18,2,"As a mobility customer i was told that you would pick the car up from my home address and this was arranged,when the person came to pick the car up he refused to take it saying that it had two illegal tyres.A couple days later the car was taken to kwik fit to be told that the car tyres where legal.Then my partner who is the driver of the car had to take a day off work to take the car to you for it's service picking up a courtesy car at the same time.he was surprised that the car was a golf which are very low to get in not suitable for a mobility customer resulting i couldn't go in the car."
2/2/18,5,Excellent service from Alex Keith - my previous experience with Mercedes Liverpool had been poor but Alex was a joy to deal with.
2/2/18,4,Staff very helpful
2/2/18,5,"Friendly service, completed the service ahead of time and discussed any additional work with me before carrying it out."
2/2/18,5,The level of service provided by Mr Kulloli was second to none. The whole process of purchasing a used Audi and trading in my vehicle went smoothly from start to finish.
2/2/18,5,Excellent service.
2/2/18,1,"Car was going in for updates due to faults but wasn’t told by the advisor who was dealing with the car that the issues couldn’t be sorted due to system being down. No courtesy car available and was told I had to pay for my own rental car from Enterprise. I complained and was told that I wouldn’t get charged but money has been take from my account. Had to be driven with a tired child to Enterprise to get the rental and came out with a Nissan. Totally shocking experience from start to finish. Land Rover sales team are good but once the sale has been made the rest of the service is poor. Not a service you would expect when you are meant to be dealing with a high end brand.

Mr J Pritchard & Miss K Woodman"
2/2/18,5,Very professional service and advice from our salesperson. We were very happy with the choice of cars available and were not rushed through the process at all. A very happy customer with a fabulous Audi Q2.

2/1/18,5,3rd vehicle from them great company
2/1/18,5,"Extremely happy with the customer experience, especially end-to-end customer care from Andre! Thank you!!!
Dropped my car RX400H yesterday for investigation and MOT. Andre was welcoming, like a bright light with a very cheery disposition. He was also very professional and extremely knowledgeable. He went above and beyond to ensure the process was seamless. He even drew diagrams to ensure I understood the recommendations on my MOT certificate - Nobody has ever thought to do that before! I am dyslexic so the visual demonstration was much appreciated! In addition, my car was clean and shiny upon collection. Another bonus!!!
Best customer service I have received from Lexus to date - 100% recommend Andre Daniels and Battersea Lexus for person-centred, transparent and seamless customer care. Highly recommended!"
2/1/18,5,"Came home with my Audi A1 last night and Im so in love with it. Cant thank Sam enough for finding the perfect car for me as Im very fussy! From going over in December to enquire to now owning an Audi, Sam was very patient and supportive in the whole process. So so pleased with my car and the service at inchcape!"

2/1/18,5,"Fantastic experience with excellent customer service. Simon Graham really looked after us from day 1 and he has a very personable and professional approach and did not 'sell' to us. He took the time to get to know us and what we needed and made the process of buying a car less stressful.
He was also very helpful and thorough with the car handover and part exchange and I would definitely recommend Simon and Audi Tetbury to others.
Thank you for our new car!"
2/1/18,2,"Having been told by my nearest Land Rover dealer that they could not MOT my Discovery, they suggested I took it to their sister Jaguar dealer. The appointment was fine but when it came to the free vehicle health check, it was not mentioned at the time my wife collected the car, nor was it sent to us by email. Two non-returned messages led to a third ‘phone call during which I was told the health check had been sent to the wrong email address and that it showed front brake pads were 60% worn. I was assured the health check would be sent to the correct email the same day. It wasn’t and if I hadn't called three times I would not have known this information about the brakes. Poor show Land Rover dealer for not being interested to MOT my Approved Used car. Poor show Jaguar dealer for not being bothered to send me the health check and tell me my brake pads are worn - this is a potential safety item isn't it? Trusted adviser? Not! I feel now that neither dealer was easy to do business with and that I cannot depend on them. I certainly don’t feel special…"
2/1/18,5,"I have dealt with Southport Mercedes Benz for over 20 years, in fact the same sales person. I have had many new cars from them including 240E, S Class, SL55's ML55, E500, ML320, GLE250 and yesterday, a new GLE350. They have never yet failed to impress. They are professional and extremely helpful. I can whole heartedly recommend their service."

2/1/18,5,"I owned a Ford Fusion for five years and decided to purchase a new car and was unsure on what I wanted perhaps a Vauxhall Mokka, Audi A3, Audi Q2 or a Ford Focus.
On recommendation from an employee of Mercedes Nottingham my first port of call was to the Nottingham showroom to look at the GLA model.
I was met by salesman Phillip Litchfield who gave me a tour of the showroom introducing me to a number of cars before taking me to the GLA but on me trying to get into the vehicle it was obvious to Phil, due to his training on ergonomics, that the GLA was not suited to me due to my height so introduced me to the B200.
We sat in B200, Phil made me at ease and gave me the best of briefings on the vehicle explaining all of the working in easy to understand plain language.
Although a diesel was available I had a preference for an automatic, with a petrol engine, which apparently were in extremely short supply in UK, but Phil found one in Scotland for me.
I looked no further for other makes of car as the B200 was everything I required and the test drive that Phil took me on proved the point.
Extremely comfortable, easy ride with excellent road holding.

2/1/18,5,Nuala at BMW Norwich gave such excellent service and was most helpful and friendly! I would definitely recommend anyone to buy a car from her as she went above and beyond throughout the process of buying my new car which I love!!
2/1/18,5,"Purchased a new Discovery Sport, Dan our salesman was very helpful in finding the car with the right spec at the right price without being pushy, not once did I feel pressurised into buying a car. We actually managed to get a higher spec car than we were expecting. When we collected the car Dan went through all the controls in the car which was a great help as it was quite different to our previous Land Rover I have no hesitation in recommending."
2/1/18,4,"Personal treatment of me was excellent. Both the Service Advisor and the Technician were truly excellent and professional in every way.
However, one of your reception girls was eating porridge behind reception. You've obviously allowed her to make her own rules otherwise she would not be doing this. You never ever in any business eat food in the public view. Also, I have on more than one occasion informed VW that my car has a private registration number - The most previous time was when I booked the car in for a service by telephone. But this was not changed. Not really acceptable for something so simple to change. So 4 stars for the individual service I received. Would have been 5 stars without the receptionist eating porridge and the inefficiency of not changing my registration number."
2/1/18,3,"I ordered a new key and was told they would contact me when it arrived, no one managed to call me. I called the following day to be told it had already arrived."
2/1/18,5,EXCELLENT as always

1/31/18,5,"My Golf has just been in to Inchcape in Stockport for it's 3yr service, brake fluid change and MOT. The personalised service from Chris, throughout the day, was both professional and friendly and I was kept fully-informed throughout. The MOT was charged at a reduced price, courtesy car provided (with complimentary insurance excess waiver), handbrake software update installed, complimentary bluetooth data plug attachment installed and to complete the experience, my car had been very thoroughly cleaned both inside and out. A very pleasant experience all round."
1/31/18,5,"Walked into the showroom on Sunday afternoon, collected my new car on Tuesday! Thank you to Mark and the team for making the purchase of my first Jaguar such an enjoyable experience. David S."
1/31/18,5,"I walked along the forecourt just browsing last Sunday morning when a lady spoke to me. I later found out she was the receptionist. She sent a salesperson (Carl) out to assist and inform .He was very helpful, enthusiastic and also knowledgeable, So much so that I purchased a super mini.
The service was second to none and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Carl did his level best to ensure that everything was spot on and ready for completion and pickup.
All in all a great experience, Thank You Carl"
1/31/18,5,"Friendly team, polite and professional. David and Kristofor have been very helpful."
1/31/18,3,"Today’s visit was for my fourth/fifth warranty visit with what is my 4th BMW and 3rd in a row from cooper.
This car has so far been my worst having 2 separate non related paint issues and a returning corrosion issue. My latest problem is an extremely loud exhaust rattle which in my mind needs fixing.
BMW while admitting there is a problem have told me that they do not have a solution for this. The issue has been reported by several customers and as yet BMW do not have a fix for it so my name has been out on a list, with no fix and more frustrating no time scale for a solution either.
I will add the staff that I dealt with were very helpful and while they could see my annoyance as a repeating customer with no solution they continued to try to support me.

In short I would say come on BMW, I need a fix for this or my next car might easily not be one from you."
1/31/18,5,"My Polo and my husband's Golf are regularly serviced by Inchcape VW Chester and I have every confidence in their technical competence. At every visit a video of the inspection process is provided so that there is no doubt that the work has been done. The service department receptionists are efficient, polite, efficient and knowledgeable. You feel you are a valued customer."
1/31/18,5,"Gary was extremely helpful, although I was looking at a different model he pointed out all the plus points of the car I decided to purchase without any pressure.
I'm very happy with my new Audi.
I would be more than happy to recommend Hyde Audi and Gary Oakes to my friends."
1/31/18,5,"I was expecting to be told of serious problems with my Discovery 4 but a wonderful surprise when Tom Rhodes told me it was a software issue, an update was available and had been fitted and I was to monitor the situation. Can't speak highly enough of JLR especially Tom. Thrilled with my Discovery 4 and will be booking the vehicle in shortly for new front brake shoes."

1/31/18,1,"Inchape Mercedes, Leicester

I booked a test drive for 1pm on 31/1/18. I arrived at the branch at 12.50pm . I checked in and was told that the sales person will not be too long. I waited and waited and at 1.30pm, without acknowledgement, I checked in with the desk again and was told that sales person will not be too long. At 1.50pm, I went to the desk again and was told that the previous test drive that the sales person was conducting had overrun.
Terrible service that I wasn't contacted at 12.30pm when I could have made arrangements to come in later and no one informed of this until nearly an hour of waiting. It is now 3.30pm, no one has rang to apologise."
1/31/18,5,"5 star service from start to finish 👍👍👍👍👍
All the staff service and sales are a credit to Cooper"
1/31/18,5,"Changed my wife's VW Beetle for a Mini 5 door hatchback. Bespoke and delivered in about three weeks; this as opposed to about six months for the Beetle, which Trish called Consuela as it was built in Mexico :0). Mini built in UK of course, and we were very much up for that. The Mini is great drive and has mindboggling technology. It was an excellent purchase and Trish is delighted with it."
1/31/18,5,"Having dealt with Gary over several weeks I found him extremely helpful at all stages of our negotiations.
For the first ever I brought the car without actually seeing the vehicle only a video and a excellent description by Gary.
The car was delivered to my house on time and by a very helpful driver.
I would highly recommend this company and would use again."
1/31/18,5,"I have used this company for at leased 8 years and always receive excellent service. I like the video they send you so you can look at the underside of the vehicle and have a running commentary by the technician.
Car is always cleaned inside and out comes back looking pristine.
Always kept informed by Vicky if any additional work is required."
1/31/18,3,Service department all good however the car wash inside and out was rather poor (flecks up muck inside the car still present) and courtesy car supplied could have at least been supplied with a fuel range adequate enough to travel to the nearest petrol station.
1/31/18,1,"Service undertaken quickly, with no issues, however tracker fitted to vehicle showed vehicle being driven at 53 mph (in 30mph zone) in built up residential area. Matter referred to police."
1/31/18,5,Really good experience. One of the drivers dropped me off in town and picked me back up at the exact time he said he would. I was text messaged a video of the technician doing the health check and was in really good detail. Servicing price was really cost effective and would definately recommend to other bmw drivers out there.
1/31/18,1,"Hi comparing TD to Cobham BMW is not a problem,
Please for a far better experience use Cobham,
TD left around waiting to be seen
Couldn’t follow basic instructions.
Car came back dirtier than when I left it
Very unhappy"
1/31/18,4,"Fast and efficient service, great courtesy car. Electronic report is fab.

For 5 star is not much missing, I think courtesy car should be full tanked for your costumer and ask costumer to return filled up, also I would expect a kind of complimentary small favour perhaps new wipers, nobody asked or offered navigation update, I asked myself about extending my service plan, this could have asked already when I booked in for service, also at booking on the phone I was asked if I have a service plan, which your system should recognize already.
Well you asked me what could make it 5 star so these are my thoughts."
1/31/18,5,Fantastic service and attention given as a returning customer.
1/31/18,5,"Recently bought a new car from Audi maidstone after purchasing one from here a few months before and am so happy with the level of service I received. All the staff are so friendly and welcoming and couldn’t do more to make the experience better. Tom was my salesman and he was so easy to talk to and made the whole buying a car experience so much easier, he wasn’t pushy he listened to what I wanted and didn’t fail to provide me with just that. Very happy with my car and the service I received"

1/30/18,5,"Great service, excellent communication & follow up. Also covered the items required under a recall at the same time."
1/30/18,5,Brilliant service! Really helped me out In a tough situation! Couldn’t praise them enough!
1/30/18,5,"Excellent experience, Neil was fantastic and im incredibly happy with my third Audi wouldnt get anything else. Seamless service"
1/30/18,4,"The actual experience of the service for my Mini at Coopers Thames Ditton was fine - no problems.

However, I did experience some confusion when booking the service regarding the arrangements for the courtesy car from Coopers to Kingston. I was led to believe that the courtesy transport was available at 08.30 or 9.30 hrs. The person I was speaking with booked me on the 8.30 service - a bit early for me but the 9.30 was too late. After delivering my car to Coopers I was told to go to the BMW reception which handles the courtesy transport to be faced by a blank faced and confused receptionist who knew nothing about the timed courtesy service. Apparently, taxis are now booked for these courtesy trips. No problem with a taxi but it would be helpful if the people handling the service bookings on the phone knew of this change to the courtesy service - it would save confusion all round. I also went back to the Mini Service Desk and he knew nothing about the time courtesy service."
1/30/18,5,Excellent service as always - tyres fitted while I waited and at a good prices. Faith once again looked after the work done to my car (as she often does) and she always goes above and beyond to make sure that the customer is happy with all aspects of the job. No hesitation in using Coopers for our BMW's :)
1/30/18,2,"NO friction but the engineers did not achieve two out of three of the required fixes until I insisted they try again.
One of them they thought they had fixed but it was not as they clearly had not tried it."
1/30/18,5,"Great sevice by a friendly and experienced staff. Car was ready for the arranged time and came back washed and valated.
Thank you"
1/30/18,5,"Very good, prompt service, completed more quickly than expected and updated during the process."
1/30/18,5,Bought my first BMW at Coopers T Wells - a 520 Touring - excellent car - Alex Ferguson sold me the car and was an excellent ambassador of the BMW brand through the whole purchasing process.
1/30/18,5,Once again - extremely satisfied with the service provided by Cooper BMW
1/30/18,5,Everything went smoothly and couldn't have been bettered.
1/30/18,2,"I recently had a very poor experience and would not recommend them for your MOT. This is the second time that I have been let down by inchcape. It seems they are very keen in selling you a car, but then forget about customer service. Think twice before you use them."
1/30/18,5,car was collected from my home all work done to usual bmw high standard and returned to my home in top class condition
1/30/18,5,Had my car in for a service today great friendly people quick to service and kept me in coffee great
1/30/18,5,"Polite, efficient, great to have the video to see what was done, and helpful (& patient) with follow up queries"
1/30/18,5,Car service and cleaned lone car ready and got what I asked for something similar to my car can’t fault the service I received first class
1/30/18,5,"Came away feeling very happy after collecting my new car.
Had a situation with a car, Audi really came up trumps for me in dealing with my problem. Love visiting Audi Maidstone, really make me feel special lots of staff greeting me and sent me off in my lovely new TT
Was a very happy girl.
I cannot fault Audi they were very professional keeping me continuously updated with what was going on behind the scenes
From my first port of call to Audi customer support a lovely lady Melinda, then Ian Alsop sorting the problem from the top,the lovely Samantha sales lady looked after me in branch and Jed organising the rest
Thanks to all of them, again very happy experience"
1/30/18,5,It was a very good experience. I had a few questions regarding systems within the car and the service guy was very patient and explained everything to me. thank you
1/30/18,5,"5 star service, particularly liked the video from the mechanic."
1/30/18,5,Customer service:- William and colleagues. Credit to Hunters. Courteous well organised. Polite. Actual Service:-Carried by Land Rover mechanical engineers to a very high standard. Ten out of ten.

1/30/18,5,Very smooth start to finish
1/30/18,5,Very good service and car ready on time stated.
1/30/18,5,"A good company via Coopers Croydon however, I do not like the Inchape warranty products."
1/30/18,4,No real problem. Car was available a little later than requested is all.
1/30/18,5,"i was very pleased with the service I received from Oliver Webster during the process of buying my new BMW 340i
everything was well explained and all the relevant paperwork was explained well. The final presentation of my car when I picked it up was very good and a couple of new functions that were on my car were well explained and he gave me assistance in setting the ""connect BMW""
Overall I rate Coopers of Reading very good and the new premises very welcoming.
Please keep it up"
1/30/18,5,"I have been using Stockport Audi for around 10 years now and would have no hesitation in recommending them to friends and colleagues alike. The staff are courteous, knowledgeable and always helpful, providing customers with a comfortable waiting room and even an office to work from while you wait. My most recent visit was in January 2018 when Emma looked after me, from taking the original booking, to handing me back the keys when the work was complete. An excellent service, every time"
1/30/18,5,"Had a major service on the A6 ,Waited while the work was being carried out .
Facilities are great and staff kept me informed at all times .
Will definitely use again"
1/30/18,5,"Top service received, no issues."
1/29/18,5,Lee evans could not have done anymore for us . He secured us a Q5 and went out of his way to make sure we were not disappointed . No ask was too much ! Jeff Marshall also did a great handover
1/29/18,5,Absolutely fantastic customer service..! A massive Thank You to Matteo & Thomas :o) Made buying our first new car an easy and unforgettable experience. Definitely went the extra mile to ensure the pickup of the car was a great experience. They made my wife feel extremely special...the little extra touches meant the world to her. Keep up the good work guys and see you again soon..!
1/29/18,5,"Happy with Service on My VW UP. and also with the feedback.
Charles Reid"
1/29/18,5,Very polite and efficient service. Well done.
1/29/18,5,"The service I received from HA Fox from the minute they picked up the car to the point at which they returned it was excellent.

Andy"
1/29/18,5,"Great service, with regular communication, would have loved to secure a better deal, but no haggling to be done! Ben did a great job and made the experience an easy, pleasurable one. F Pace looks amazing."
1/29/18,5,I purchased a used Range Rover from Hunters Land Rover in Southampton and the experience was excellent. All the staff were extremely professional and James in particular who presented the vehicle and took me for a test drive was very knowledgable about the car and the brand. A very positive experience and I would definitely buy from them again in the future.
1/29/18,5,Very pleasant professional sales and service team here at teesside BMW. Welcomed by very pleasent dealership staff at the teesside dealership showing a high level of hospitality. Looking forward to my next visit.
1/29/18,1,"I was due to purchase a 2 year old 640 Gran Coupe from this dealership. It was a 4 hour round trip to this dealer for the model I wanted

Went to collect it a week later after putting deposit on. The car had not been prepared to the expected standard. Wheels still dirty etc. I have purchased 6 approved used BMW over the last 10 years. This experience was shocking. We rejected the vehicle. The salesman was excellent it is Inchscape (The owner of this Franchise) who is the issue. Penny pinching. I know I pay a premium for BMW approved used. This was not worth it.

We got our deposit back. As we were close to big Motorworld who were open to 21:00. We found a lovely well presented 1 year old 7 serise.

We paid £40k and drove it away that night. Fantastic setup and well presented ready to drive away cars.

While we were also in the dealership there was an elderly lady waiting to order a new 2 serise with her disabled husband.

They had been waiting two hours and team had been so rude. Go elsewhere. Hope they lose the franchise."
1/29/18,5,Good service and kept up to date with progress
1/29/18,5,A pleasure doing business with Coopers
1/29/18,5,Very helpful lovely smooth transition would highly recommend them
1/29/18,5,"The service is excellent as always at Coopers BMW in Norwich. Only observation is that free wash and hoover isn't really worth it as they don't so much of. a clean up job, certainly not to my standards even if I do a quick valet of my car.

Otherwise the dealership is highly recommended!"
1/29/18,5,Lovely sales person (Chantal) really helpful and great communication.
1/29/18,5,Had a nice and easy experience choosing my new mini. Charlie was really helpful and made sure I drove away with the best mini for me. Thank you for your help throughout this process.
1/29/18,4,"Southend Inchcape provided a very satisfying customer experience when booking the service. I was slightly disappointed that the service technician forgot to reset the Tyre Pressure Monitoring System after adding some air to a front tyre. On my way home, the system alerted me to a pressure problem which meant I had to drive 8 miles back to the dealer to get the car checked. Overall a good experience which would have been awarded 5 stars without the tyre incident."
1/29/18,5,Looked after and supported
1/29/18,5,"Excellent customer service, as always."
1/29/18,5,Excellent service as always
1/29/18,3,"The car was collected and dropped off on time and with no issues. The work was carried out in line with specifications, but the email I received to update me on critical work was OTT.

In addition the courtesy was and vac of the car was not carried out well at all, which was not a major issue, but if you offer a free service then make sure it is carried out well."
1/29/18,5,Service was excellent Jason organised everything from start to finish and done exactly as said
1/29/18,5,"Clare was amazing in helping me with my new clubman.
She gave up her Saturday morning to come into work and completed the final part of the paperwork with me so as I could take the car that day.
She kept me updated with emails and phone calls and sorted everything out very quickly and efficiently.
Massive thank you for all your hard work!!

Michelle xx"
1/29/18,5,Took car in for service whilst away from home...all good and 10% cheaper than my normal dealer. Very pleasant and helpful service staff. That said I am glad I wasn’t test driving or picking up a car as whilst waiting in customer area a couple of hours I observed other customers who had appointments were waiting for ever in the customer area to be seen by sales staff....I would have been long gone!
1/29/18,5,"Recommend dealership, good service and courteous staff."
1/29/18,5,"I recently purchased a new VW Touran (Dec 2017) from VW Twickenham Inchape and Samson Poroku was the sales representative that I dealt with and who i found to be excellent.
I have had an Audi A4 and VW Polo in the past and given a poor customer experience I vowed never to purchase from he VW group again. With a specific interest in the Touran and Sharan for my family I spent time at the VW Chiswick Flagship showroom with a sales representative and was very unimpressed with the level of knowledge and enthusiasm of the staff. I made one final attempt to deal with VW at the Twickenham branch and was very impressed with Samson. He had a deep knowledge of the vehicles on offer , was very efficient at organising test drives and providing information to my family (unlike VW Chiswick) and looked to sincerely find the most suitable vehicle for my family regardless of which was more expensive (eg the VW sharan). His knowledge and helpfulness post sale has also been excellent and from his advice I have also subsequently purchaser a VW UP second hand and spent a lot on updating and servicing the vehicle specially at VW Twickenham because of my interaction with him.
I intend to keep the relationship at this stage and am currently recommending him to friends and family.
Samson restored my confidence in the VW group and is a knowledgeable, respectful and pleasant salesman with a good sense of humour and as a result i would say is a great ambassador for the VW group.
Mr Rahman"
1/29/18,5,"Recommend you visit Cooper BMW Durham before you purchase

The deal may surprise you.

No pressure sound advice"
1/29/18,5,"Jon was very professional in his approach and didn't push us in any way towards a sale. He listened to our requirements and offered his experience and advice to direct us toward what was best for us.
All staff involved in this transaction were exemplary."
1/29/18,5,"I recently purchased a new Mini from Cooper Banstead and found everyone that I dealt with polite, efficient and very helpful.

The showroom is clean and well presented with a wide selection of Mini's on show.

On the day of collection, I was given a thorough overview of the vehicle and was made to feel very welcome.

Well done to everyone at Cooper Banstead!"
1/29/18,5,"This was my third purchase (and second TT) from Audi Maidstone in seven years...as always, a speedy, efficient and friendly service...what more can I say?!!! Thank you Mike, Jed and Malo..."
1/29/18,3,I found the booking via a call center very hard and took a long time. The process is easy if you want to book your car in for a service a week in advanced- however if you are booking in for an emergency work to be carried out then it is not easy.
1/29/18,5,"We purchased our car with the assistance of an incredibly helpful salesman called Chris Galvin, because the garage is in Cheshire and we live in Scotland it was essential we had someone we could trust to deal with the trade in and purchase. Chris ticked all the boxes and from start to finish was a delight to deal with, always returning calls and responding to our queries via e mail. We would highly recommend both him and the garage. All staff during our visit to collect our new car were friendly and helpful including the garage hostess. Well worth the 5 hour drive!"
1/29/18,3,"Job took longer than expected.
Quality is in the detail, obviously they had to disconnect the battery to carry out the task & I know this may seem petty but it would have been nice if they could have corrected the time & date on the clock after re-connecting the battery."
1/29/18,5,very good service
1/29/18,3,"I purchased my first Mercedes at the weekend! I was very excited and looking forward to collecting my car. The salesman was great and the service he provided was good. However, what I did not expect is for Mercedes to send me home in a car that had already been damaged at the showroom. This totally spoilt my day that had been building up for a while. Why was this not spotted before I collected it? I agree, I did not spot it at first (too excited) but to be honest I though Mercedes was a brand I could trust and that I would not be sent home with a brand new vehicle that had been damaged in the showroom/preparation stage and then attempted to be covered up. Disappointing. The issue will be resolved by Mercedes Derby but for a car of the price I paid I expected better."
1/29/18,3,"Unusually, not the best experience this time!
Had 2 cars booked in to have cameras fitted and had booked a courtesy car for the day. The car came with only 16 miles worth of petrol in it! Now I don't mind paying for petrol but 16 miles is a little low to be giving a good impression to a customer!
1st car was completed ok however we were advised when we took the 2nd car in that it needed a software update (recall item) - this couldn't be completed and we had to wait around 30 monists for the car to be finished, and have had to rebook for another visit!
Not great this time team!"
1/29/18,5,"Great experience! Ricky, my salesman was great, kept me up to date on the process of my new car and got me in it as soon as he could! Was in my new car 6 weeks earlier than expected.

Would highly reccomend!"
1/29/18,5,Always excellent highly recommend.
1/29/18,4,"Looked after very well especially by Elaine Dent on reception, her service to customers is second to none. Service reception kept me informed and I wasn't waiting too long and a real bonus... I had my car washed and vacuumed

Thank you Tetbury Audi for good service"
1/29/18,5,First class service from the reception & service team
1/29/18,5,"Friendly professional quick and
Hassle free
Video showing full diagnostic of engineers check on vehicle
Nice to know what is wrong with the car and see for yourself"
1/29/18,4,Very professional from.the moment of stepping in. I had my car serviced (great job) without the cowboy antics!!
1/29/18,5,Polite staff efficiently serviced honestly priced
1/29/18,5,Fist service carried out with no issues and whilst I waited in the showroom! Staff excellent and efficient!
1/29/18,5,"This is the second time I have bought a car from Banstead Mini, the customer/sales service provided by Kayleigh was outstanding. She helped me buy the car I wanted, took me on a test drive and assisted with all the paperwork, making it all very easy. She was very professional and responsive to all my asks. I now have a brilliant Cooper S to replace my Mini Cooper, I'm really pleased with the car and the condition I bought it in, also got it at a good price."
1/29/18,5,Great service every time we visit sales and service.
1/29/18,5,no problems experienced
1/29/18,5,"Friendly, attentive staff."
1/29/18,3,"Car was collected to plan, no problem. When car was returned and checked the following day, I was not pleased.
Due to a disability with my left arm and fingers, when I collected the car from New the car was set up with all settings set ready to go.
After previous service it was returned ready to go. This time it was not so, I have an extension on my seat belt to enable me to reach to plug belt in, this had been detached and pushed down between the seat and centre console, out of my reach.
The rear seat was folded down when you collected the car, on return the seat backs appeared to be up but were not fixed, as the seat belts were trapped in the locking mechanism, this I did not discover until the following weekend, when my grandchildren tried to use the seat belts.
The warning triangle was not in place, just thrown in the boot, not held by the Velcro.
My husband checks fluid levels every weekend, so all fluids were correct.
Last year you charged for a litre of screenwash, but put the full bottle in the boot, this year the screenwash was charged for but it would not have been required, but it was not left for me.
Overall a very disappointing experience."
1/29/18,3,"I prebooked a service with attention also flagged to malfunctioning front passenger seat sensor. The service was not completed on the day it was booked and ran into the next day with little warning of this. Also when I picked it up the next day the seat had still not been repaired and I had to rebook for that plus other work. Apparently due to parts being ‘available’ but not at Coopers. Communication was poor, rather brusque, and matter of fact..not apologetic in the least.
I also ordered a boot liner on the second visit and never received a call saying it was there ready for collection, even though 3 weeks had passed.
I do not feel I had service of a high standard. Take a leaf out of a Toyota’s book . They are excellent. Only recently needing to use BMW..I am diasappointed."
1/28/18,4,"easy to book and time suited, work carried out on time.
disappointed however with no newspapers to read and no biscuits now"
1/28/18,3,As usual good service. Alarmed at cost and in hindsight could have been verbally communicated better before works commenced.
1/28/18,1,"Appalling customer service. Signed order to supply me with a car that was sold to somebody else! Paid a £500 deposit. Asked for my deposit to be returned three times in five days. Still no payment.
This is less than third rate service. Be very careful before parting with your cash. Will post an update daily."
1/28/18,5,Really helpful staff and efficient service.
1/28/18,5,"Excellent service from booking to collection. Tamara Lewis kept me updated and was super efficient in dealing with vehicle, great customer skills."
1/28/18,5,"First class service on every visit
Professional, friendly and knowledgeable staff
Highly recommended company"
1/28/18,5,"Friendly, efficient service. Very professional and they look after you very well. Everything is explained and it is fantastic to be sent a short video ( in real time) showing what they find on your car when it is in for a service."
1/28/18,5,Excellent customer service
1/28/18,5,Very pleased with the service received and Lisa looked after everything for me.
1/27/18,5,"Fantastic service from knowledgeable and friendly staff. Highly recommended, especially Amir who provided excellent 5* customer service.
The car is great too!"
1/27/18,5,Very professional and curstious staff. Very welcoming and approachable. Any issues or problems were sorted promptly and efficiently. Would use them again. Very happy customer.
1/27/18,5,Excellent service would not go anywhere else
1/27/18,5,"Excellent customer service provided by Danny at Cheshire Oaks Audi. Danny was extremely patient, went above and beyond for my parents Alan and Vena who purchased a car from the dealership on the 22nd January 2018. I would have no reservations in recommending Danny at Cheshire Oaks Audi to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle. Thank you."
1/27/18,5,"I took my car for a service , given a coutesey car which was fab, a video was sent to me whilst having its health check so I new exactly what was being done, Callum called at 4pm to say my car was ready when I got there it had been cleaned inside and out , it has to go in for another small repair which is already booked and again I shall be getting a coutesey vehicle, I shall be ordering another Bmw this year which I am sure will go smoothly ."
1/27/18,4,Very good customer service from booking car in to the service itself. I have given 4 stars rather than 5 because the valet/clean of inside the car was not the best I’ve seen. Litter from inside the car was left on the back seat and the vacuuming wasn’t great.
1/27/18,4,"The service I received from Coopers was first class. Personally if I had a customer that I sold a new Mini to two years ago in the showroom for 90 mins , I would be showing him the any advances that had been introduced over that period. There staff were very nice and courteous."
1/27/18,5,"Great service all round, nice friendly staff."
1/27/18,4,"Just purchased new SL
I attended the ""Event"" on 15th September 2017 at Mercedes of Coventry without a particular intention of replacing my then current SL. However I was offered a good deal and agreed to proceed to purchase a new one.
Over the autumn I was unhappy with the service I received from the Sales Team. I was not kept abreast of what was happening and had to ring myself on several occasions. I paid a deposit for a new vehicle 21st September since it finally became apparent that a vehicle in stock would not be available [after me having to pursue the sales team].
I rang again on 12th October as I had neither received a receipt for my deposit nor a copy of the New Vehicle Order. and was unable to speak to John O'Neil or Thomas Turner, both of whom I had dealt with before. The following day Tom phoned me and emailed me the relevant documents.
John contacted me in December, as promised, to update me on build progress.
Owing to John's indisposition I have latterly been looked after by Katie Britton-Powell. Her help and responsiveness has been exemplary, hence the 4 star rating.
Prior to Katie taking over I would have only offered you one star. She saved the day."
1/27/18,5,"All staff friendly and helpful from first phoning to book in through to hand over after service.
Car washed and cleaned beautifully. They even arranged a lift into town and pick up whillst car was being serviced. Sent video report of work done or work that needs doing in the future was very useful."
1/27/18,5,This is the second time I have bought a car from them. They are extremely helpful and made it a enjoyable process. I was unusual in that the car I was partexchanging had foreign plates this proved to be no obstacle for them.
1/27/18,5,"Excellent customer service from Macclesfield. Emergency warning light appeared and 5ey booked the car in, ran a diagnostic, recognised the fault and took appropriate action. The best part was keeping me informed of timescales at all times."
1/27/18,5,"As always, excellent service. Pleasant, swift, and always kept up to date with progress."
1/27/18,5,"Customer service at Mercedes Cheshire Oaks is excellent, all the staff are very friendly and helpful, in particular Simon Roberts who was very professional throughout our dealings with him."
1/27/18,5,"Great experience finding my new car with Mini Chelmsford and would definitely recommend them. I was 100% satisfied and everything was explained properly without me feeling pressurised or rushed.

Will certainly return in the future 😉"
1/26/18,4,"Really great service provided while you wait, so no mean feat for a Mercedes! Top Marks."
1/26/18,5,"Great experience. Appointment on time. Lovely coffee. Car cleaned inside and out. Collection time as stated. Fair price. Friendly professional staff.
What's not to like?
Thanks Audi."
1/26/18,5,Very friendly and efficient customer service. The car service was completed earlier than expected and comprehensive details received of exactly what was done and of the minor additional work which was found to be necessary.
1/26/18,5,"An exceptional team of professionals that delivers! Fast, efficient and personal service (with a smile). Absolutely the best service centre for all MB requirements that I have had the pleasure of visiting whenever required. Painless booking, handover and complete review of what's required, estimated and delivered without delay. Keep up the great quality."
1/26/18,4,It was good that free winter check was provided. It proves that Inchcap cares their customers. When I phoned to book the free winter check I was told that a software update was available and they did it at the same time. The upgrade shouldn’t have been done if I didn’t contact them which doesn’t evidence a good dealership. I would have given 5 star if they contacted me regarding the upgrade.
1/26/18,5,From arriving until leaving the service was excellent
1/26/18,3,"When I made the appointment to book my car in for a service and MOT I was given a ""short time"" appointment and was told my car should be in for 3-4 hours, so it should have been ready for 1.30 p.m.. However, this did not turn out to be the case. We arrived at 9.15 a.m. for an appointment time of 9.30 a.m. and my car was booked in. We agreed that I needed the car by 2.30 p.m. but during a subsequent telephone conversation with Volkswagen was told that it would not be ready until 3.30 p.m, making it 6 hours before I could collect my car."
1/26/18,3,"Oil service and air-con service all ok but Inchcape did not resolve my problem of badly fitted front number plate which was fitted new 2 years ago by them.
Despite being a main VW dealer they could not advise on how to update the mapping on my sat nav system. The maps were out of date when I bought the vehicle 2 years ago. VW web page directs me to my local dealer to assist but Inchcape tells me that it cannot be updated by them unless I buy new SD card from them at a cost of £98 every time i need to update."
1/26/18,5,"Very helpful, informative, excellent service."
1/26/18,5,Great customer service provided by Natasha at Inchcape Southend
1/26/18,5,Prompt attention and friendly staff. Timing of appointment exactly in line with timing given on making appointment.
1/26/18,3,"Having bought this vehicle from Mercedes of southport, and having a service contract with them , on the last two services , having been told the car would be valeted, they did not do this service, having spoken to a nice young girl who told me that if I would bring the car back to the dealership this would be done for me, i am very disappointed in the dealership."
1/26/18,5,Easy booking service. Friendly and courteous staff. Work completed in the requested timescale.
1/26/18,4,"My car was serviced 25.1.18. It should have been serviced 10 days earlier but there was a severe admin error at Inchcape which led to this not happening. Apologies were received but no explanation about why this occurred. This caused considerable inconvenience to me.

The service finally took place on 25:1;18 and everything went smoothly and the service I received ideal and what I would expect from Inchcape"
1/26/18,5,Car service - no problem booking in advance. Welcome service reception. Courtesy car provided. Car serviced ok and also washed. No problems
1/26/18,1,"Hi everyone just a quick update, Tunbridge Wells Audi delivered the car to my home and it was gleaming and they sent a lovely bunch of flowers for my girlfriend. We have had 4 weeks of faultless driving, Until Monday. when the Door handle decided to stop working AGAIN. I called my Tunbridge Wells Audi contact and he was quick and officiant in organising the collection of our vehicle that Friday (4 days later) where we would be given a courtesy car. Great. However I wake up friday morning to test the door and it worked. So I called them first thing and left a message explaining the situation and I heard nothing back from them. They were scheduled to collect the car at 11am. They decided to contact us at 10:50 am and tell us how they will not come and collect the vehicle because it’s not broken. Even though it hasn’t worked all week!
I asked for the head of service, head of approved sales and the technician who worked on the car to sign the documents before I received the car 4 weeks previous to assure me the problem was fixed Which they did. So you would think if that same issue is occurring 4 weeks later they would want to do something about it but no, they clearly do not care about the quality of the cars they sell to their customers. Buying from Tunbridge Wells Audi is the worst thing I have ever done! They should be embarrassed.
However if you need anyone to choose you flowers they do a great job."
1/26/18,5,"That staff were excellent,we were looked after by them ,and the car was faultless.Many Thanks we will use them again."
1/26/18,5,"Coopers BMW Norwich: Very professional, polite and friendly staff. Made me feel important as a customer. Very much like the idea of a video recording of the inspection of my car."
1/26/18,5,"Brillant from start ti finish, even sent video of car health check.
Dirty when sent in, like new when picked up"
1/26/18,5,Excellent service as always

1/26/18,5,"Absolute excellent service and could not ask for me. From the booking of my car with my lease company to the point of collection, the service was second to none and I could not fault in any way, shape or form. Courteous, friendly and a real pleasure to deal with. Thank you"
1/26/18,5,Absolutely fabulous service throughout my whole journey yesterday. Ellie Farrell is without doubt a credit to your organisation. Very professional service from the whole team involved. I also appreciate the additional video demonstrating the recommendations from the service.
1/26/18,5,Good friendly customer service. No nonsense and clear explanation of work undertaken. Will return 10/10
1/26/18,5,"My urgent enquiry was dealt with in a very timely manner, communication at all times was excellent and my individual needs were catered for. I could not recommend the dealership any higher and it leads me to believe I will be a repeat customer in the future"
1/26/18,4,"Friendly and efficient service. The car service itself was quicker than expected and cheaper too! The car, however, was not cleaned, which was a little disappointing..."
1/26/18,5,"We purchased a near 3 year old 320i xdrive luxury GT, trading in a high mileage 530d tourer. The whole transaction was more than satisfactory. Here’s hoping the driving experience works out the same way. Although between my wife and I, this is our 9th bmw so we should know what we are buying"
1/26/18,5,"The service we received was excellent, the collection driver went out of his way to make Collect our car as we needed to leave for the airport very early.

The repairs were all done on time and we were fully informed all the way.

We wouldn’t choose anyone other than Mercedes Benz Loughborough"
1/26/18,5,"The perfect experience. Handled from start to finish with great care. Colin, Stacey and the team at Audi made it all so easy and you know that your car is getting the best level of service available."
1/26/18,5,Very friendly helpful staff
1/26/18,5,The staff make you feel very welcome. I receive great customer service each time I visit. Very professional. A great customer service experience.
1/26/18,5,A most efficient repaair
1/26/18,5,Excellent service. They took the time to understand our requirements and set out to meet them as quickly as possible.
1/26/18,5,"Helped us out of a crisis with speed, charm and efficiency. Most impressive."
1/26/18,4,"Could not open tailgate of my Passat. VW Chelmsford rectified problem. Afterwards on paperwork, said they could not find service book or locking wheel nut. They have said this before, in both cases wheel nut and service book were in car. Perhaps would be a good idea to ask at time car is booked in to place the items on front seat if they do not want to look in glove box."
1/25/18,5,Always feel that the service is excellent here. The price for the latest work actually was c.25% less than quoted as the work took less time than anticipated. A nice bonus.
1/25/18,5,Good honest SERVICE at a competitive price point. Thank you.
1/25/18,4,Was very pleased with the service that we received.
1/25/18,2,"Our Mini went in for its first MoT and to have the petrol filler cap tether replaced. We went to collect the car (when phoned to say it was ready) to find it unlocked, the passenger window wide open (it was raining), the filler flap open and the body work dented just behind the flap closure line.
To be fair, they accepted responsibility for the dent immediately, but to cut a very long story short, the first repair was botched and for the second (proper attempt) they had the car for a week and although cosmetically ok we were never warned it would take so long, or offered a replacement car.
The above complaint is only the main problem associated with our visit !!
We have never had such poor service from any garage in the past 40 years - ranging from Ford to Porsche - and will be very reluctant to take a Mini or BMW to this dealer again."
1/25/18,5,"Quick, easy, polite, helpful.

Fantastic service!"
1/25/18,5,"Really good service, friendly and most accommodating. The video health check impressive and very helpful. Very transparent service"
1/25/18,5,Very impressed with the Service and the Staff at Cooper Cobham. They are simply the best!!
1/25/18,5,"Malcolm Edwards the gentleman we dealt with was so helpful and didn’t push in any way to sell additional add ons. He was so professional and very helpful and friendly.
Will definitely go back to him when we change the car next time"
1/25/18,5,"Katie Needham was an absolute pleasure to deal with and I am sure she found us her most difficult customers, but she was very professional and went above and beyond to find me the perfect car, I love it! thank you Katie and team at Inchape Land Rover Preston"
1/25/18,5,"Recently bought a used car from Swindon Audi. Gareth was very professional and helpful in my needs. Would definitely recommend purchasing from this dealership, and customer service from Gareth was excellent."
1/25/18,5,Bmw tunbridge wells has fantastic service
1/25/18,5,Speedy professional MOT service
1/25/18,5,"In and out with minimum fuss, all as expected. First class service!"
1/25/18,5,"Really well looked after at Inchcape and was able to get exactly what I wanted very quickly. Big thank you to Kinga who looked after me superbly and listened to what I wanted - which included no fuss and certainly no big ""reveal"" of the new car"
1/25/18,4,"Service provided, communication and replacement of part under warranty all excellent and 5 star.
Only reason marked down by 1 star was due to the traffic in and out. I live in Leicester but work in Nottingham. Almost 2 hours each way albeit both journeys at rush hour. Would use again but will have my car collected and dropped off next time."
1/25/18,5,"Easy to book an appointment, no waiting, easy to get a replacement car, fluent communication on the different stages of the process"
1/25/18,3,"Didn’t pick car up until 11.40am, received no phone call about them running late."
1/25/18,5,"Very helpful, cut right back on the sales-speak nonsense and straight to the point of any direct questions I asked. Ultimately this is the reason I bought a car from here rather than Audi. Ended up with a good financial deal.
Premises impressive, good selection of vehicles. Even the coffee was good standard!"
1/25/18,5,Excellent experience.
1/25/18,5,The car was collected as arranged by a very pleasant and courteous driver and delivered back after the service in the same way.
1/25/18,5,"Excellent service by Carl Baker
No reservations in recommending this company"
1/25/18,5,"Friendly reception staff, patient staff (Claire?) on service desk as my two children were quite distracting, MOT took as long as I was told (very helpful when children in tow) and I was kept up-to-date with telephone/email. The video of the findings of MOT was interesting."
1/25/18,5,Excellent level of service at Tunbridge Wells Audi.
1/25/18,4,"The service is excellent and very friendly, although the costs are higher than non-franchise garages."
1/25/18,3,"Booked car in for a major service and first time using this dealer.
Will break it down my first encounter on enquiring about service felt I was looked at as being unable to pay and asked how I was going to pay for it which I answered by cash or debit card.

On my second encounter taking the car into dealership for service and due to traffic I was 10 mins late for which I apologised profusely and handed keys into hands of chap. Then I had to sit with someone else and again asked how I was going to pay for it this is ridiculous as I had already stated this on a previous visit.

They then went over the work to be carried out fair enough

I was directed to the tea coffee area to wait whilst car being serviced. The waiting area is a little cramped by the tea machine but drinks are free and they offer a mini taxi service if you need to go anywhere whilst waiting nice touch.

The service carried out and the video feedback is excellent well done to the machanics and backroom staff you deserve 5 stars

Front of house please do not judge a book by its cover shame on you as thats how I felt when I walked in your showroom. This is why you have 3 stars.

Will I use you again is the question who knows ?"
1/25/18,5,"I had my BMW 3 Series yesterday. The work was carried out professionally and on time. I was impressed by the video taken showing the condition of the tyres and indicating one will need to be changed in a few months.

The service administrator was very helpful both when handing over the car and when I called back to collect it."
1/25/18,5,"very good experience with buying my second hand car. Found the staff very helpful especially the salesmen Gary & John who dealt with us.


This review is an exception for me as I do not do surveys!"
1/25/18,5,"Excellent service. We would recommend the company to others. Our Sales Person was so helpful, explaining everything in plain english. A pleasant experience."
1/25/18,5,"Excellent dealership; very polite staff. Very comparable on pricing, had two new rear tyres put on and had an issue with the battery/service light which Coopers sorted out for me and saved me some money too! Coopers are a wonderful dealers, keep you informed along the way and I would recommend Coopers for a Mini (or a BMW). Had my car serviced by them since I bought it in 2013, always been excellent."
1/25/18,5,"The service was really friendly, Kim was so helpful and I was able to find the perfect car! Would recommend Macclesfield Audi :)"
1/25/18,5,I was looked after hansomely.
1/24/18,5,Consistent customer delight from Ben and Matthew in the Service department. They always exceed my expectations and ensure everything is taken care of. I trust the team implicitly and would always recommend Maidstone Audi
1/24/18,4,"Friendly and approachable, knowledgeable about their product.
Need to make it much more clearer about additional extras and what these costs are"
1/24/18,5,Nice and relaxed non pushy salesman and came away with a beautiful car
1/24/18,5,"The problem of water ingress into the boot of my VW Golf was cured and compensation was authorised by way of a new tyre and slightly discounted service to the vehicle. The staff were friendly, knowledgable and helpful and all works were carried out to the timescale discussed and a courtesy car provided."
1/24/18,5,The whole experience was hassle free and very informative they even sent me a video of the service and explained everything the was done overall could not fault it🚗
1/24/18,5,Efficient and friendly. Professional
1/24/18,4,Good level of service through to booking and receiving our car back however very expensive for a small car service!
1/24/18,5,"Good service, friendly and assertive staff - and car was spotless when I collected it!!"
1/24/18,5,Excellent service in all respects
1/24/18,5,"No pushy talk, no nonsense, good car, good price, professionally sold and delivered. Ms Marny Savery was our sales executive. We will be back to see her for our next car."
1/24/18,5,"Superb service yet again from cooper Sunderland, wife had a curtesy car which she loved, video sent of car being checked, just outstanding all round , Stuart explained everything to my wife and we would definitely recommend cooper Sunderland"
1/24/18,5,Great experience having my car serviced recently at VW Stockport. Friendly staff and excellent service.
1/24/18,4,Efficient service. Received a phone call as soon as car was ready. Would recommend.
1/24/18,5,"I have had my car serviced today it was done very quickly and cleaned for me the only problem I had as a disabled person is having to climb the stairs to the first floor, as a mobility customer it would be better if I could have been met on the ground floor were I could have waited by reception. Had I have been in my wheel chair I would never have managed"
1/24/18,5,"Very good service
Everything explained comfortable waiting area. Very not very staff"
1/24/18,1,"The sales guy Will was very helpful and polite, but the branch manager John Robertson tried to defraud us out of our deposit.

We were not able to proceed, with an order despite it being agreed, as unfortunately the key broke off in the ignition of the car we were part exchanging. When we advised them of this, I was advised the branch manager was wanting to withhold my £100 deposit, which is a breach of the T&Cs and unlawful.

I thought such practices had stopped, but it seems at Mini in Boldon they are used to try and force people into contracts.

To be fair the sales guy Will was extremely helpful, so this is no reflection on him but I’d recommend giving them a wide berth!!!"
1/24/18,5,Very pleased with the service from your staff and the work carried out on my car
1/24/18,5,"I bought a car over the phone. I’m just south of Bristol and the service I have received has been excellent. The Land Rover was delivered to my door on time and completely as expected and seen on the web.
The people at Hunters in York have been really helpful producing videos of the vehicle before buying and then for the handover as well.
We are really pleased and would definitely use Hunters again. Really great service."
1/24/18,5,"Very helpful and friendly staff. Happy to help and very patient whilst trying to make a decision.
Car is amazing!"
1/24/18,5,"Service was completed within the hour, the young lady who dealt with me couldn't have been more helpful."
1/24/18,2,"I always seem to be waiting around, even after a call to say my car is ready, when I arrive I still have a 20 minute wait. So I join the other people who seem to be annoyed and waiting too....."
1/24/18,5,Aimee was an excellent Appointment Controller. Very helpful in a knowledgeable way and although l didn't agree with her position on my cars driver seat defect the overall experience was very good
1/24/18,5,"Very professional and helpful. I may of made it easy for their salesman ( an excellent guy called Phil Cox ) as I had done my research beforehand and knew exactly what deal I wanted. The first offer was not good enough but I countered with the deal I wanted and said that with that deal I would definitely buy and he gave the deal. Overall a quick, easy and very satisfactory visit. All the staff are very courteous and helpful."
1/24/18,5,The whole of the reception/service staff do an excellent job looking after the customer..
1/24/18,3,The service was good however the staff came across as a little pretentious and made me feel like an inconvenience for havingy 18 month old daughter with me. I was mot made to feel welcome in the reception area whilst I waited for a friend to pick me up and wasn't even offered a drink.
1/24/18,5,"Professional friendly service, MOT was performed quickly and had a complementary valet"
1/24/18,1,"Don't expect any customer service at Hunters of York,
THERE ISN'T ANY!!!!
I have been trying to purchase a car from them and 'they' can't even be bothered to return my calls. The sales manager Steve Orton is either not getting the messages from the receptionists or is being arrogant in thinking I will buy anyway. WRONG STEVE, WRONG HUNTERS
Inchcape beware arrogance does not buy you business!
Bye Bye Hunters"
1/24/18,4,Friendly efficient service
1/24/18,5,"We’ve had excellent customer service from start to finish at Mini in Malton. Buying a mini for our daughter was a pleasure with Jack Redmond, who most definitely went the extra mile to ensure the car was perfect in every way. We thoroughly recommend this garage and wouldn’t hesitate to use them again in the future."
1/24/18,3,"Friendly reception, car cleaned beautifully but very little information about what was actually done during the service. Minimal documentation, nothing regarding the supposed recall work.

Getting information about the work done is always rather akin to getting blood out of a stone! I have long since given up asking to be allowed to speak to someone with actual technical knowledge."
1/24/18,5,"great experience with service team took car in for service due to message when I switched on. engineer messaged me to say only needs brake fluid change full service not required before 8000 more miles or 2019 which ever comes first. Big saving !! Nice to find an honest garage that only do the work necessary, it would have been easy to do the full service as I'd ask for it with out talking to me. ( car on 2 year service schedule wow.)"
1/23/18,5,First class service as always from all the staff who always go the extra mile to deliver the best customer service. I would like to give a special mention to Faith Mays who always makes sure I am looked after. Well done Cooper Norwich
1/23/18,5,All staff were very helpful and courteous. A problem with hands-free phone connection quickly sorted in addition to standard service.
1/23/18,5,"Great customer service, fabulous choice of cars & finance deals!"
1/23/18,5,Customer service is very good. Work is explained in easy to understand way
1/23/18,5,My Car was in for its second service together with 2 recalls. Dean Luke from Inchcape was a pleasure to deal with and the whole experience from drop off to collection was hassle free as ever.
1/23/18,5,Well qualified engineering staff. Prompt service.
1/23/18,5,"Always a pleasure to visit Mercedes Inchcape. They are always so kind, helpful and pleasant and look after their customers."
1/23/18,5,"Gorgeous showroom, good customer service."
1/23/18,5,Excellent service all round
1/23/18,5,First service for my BMW X3. Stephen Lunn looked after me. He was extremely friendly and very thorough. He kept me informed about how long the car would be as we were waiting whilst the car was being serviced. A wee bit pricey though!
1/23/18,5,"excellent service from audi staff.
From beverages at reception to the care and consideration
shown by donna, it was a first class experience.
The open plan layout and minimum waiting time also added to the experience."
1/23/18,4,"Great experience in purchasing my car, Tom and Joe were helpful but not pushy, informative and considered in helping me with my choice of car."
1/23/18,1,"Inchcape Chelmsford - TERRIBLE customer service.
Spoke to the rudest woman called Mandy in the service department - she needs a refresher on good customer service skills.
Nothing but issues ever since I bought my VW. In future I will never buy from VW again.

A word from the wise, take your hard earned money and spend it on Merc, Audi, BMW or literally anything else other than VW."
1/23/18,5,The online booking device was great. The team were very helpful and the car was ready fir collection when promised
1/23/18,2,"Had mt car serviced yesterday but ws not informed when the car would be ready to be collected. I spoent 20 mins tryoing to get through on their service phone line and eventually got through only to be told that they thought i would be collecting around 5 anyway. A courtesy phone call would of been nice to confirm all the work had been carried out and the vehicle was ready.
I normally receive Audi cam videos showing / explaining what work has been carried out but even these weren't sent till after i had collected the car and even then there wasn't any video's attached just recommended work that could of been carried out on car and no mention of the extra work i paid to have done as i was told these were due to be done but not included in the service pack! (was this work actually carried out?)
Not the best service experience iv had from Audi Stockport."
1/23/18,4,"Service, cam belt change and MOT booked by phone a month in advance, including a time to bring the car in. The service etc was fine and the car ready and cleaned at the agreed time and at the agreed price.
My only issue, prior to the service, was being emailed and phoned several times to remind me I needed to book a service, even though when I queried this, the callers admitted my appointment was already booked! I assume this is either a staff training issue on a computer system failing."
1/23/18,5,"Excellent from start to finish dealt with Nick Bromley can honestly say wouldn't hesitate recommending Stockport Audi to anyone great service
Thank you"
1/23/18,4,Excellent service from everybody as usual. Nothing too much trouble.
1/23/18,5,"Very efficient, from front of house to the guys servicing the car or fixing problems.
Superb job"
1/23/18,5,Arrived on time and were welcomed and well looked after. We were offered coffee while we were waiting for the service representative to come to us. The coffee and biscuit were made and delivered to a table for us. Everything went smoothly from then on. All in all we couldn't have expected or received better service.
1/23/18,5,"Called in to get a price for my scuffed wing mirror and had a price and the car booked in in minutes. Job carried out as agreed and to the high standard I wanted. Brilliant, very pleased."
1/23/18,5,"Excellent, friendly service as always."
1/23/18,3,"There was no welcome, reception didn't offer a seat or a drink, I just got told to wait. I had someone waiting for me outside and it took 25mins before they even allocated anyone to talk to me. (this person was very good once i saw them) I left my car there to be fixed the same day. I rang later that day to ask for a time to pick it up and i was passed around to 4 different people having to repeat the same identification information to all of them. When i came to collect the car, there again, was no welcome on the site. Reception did not have my job on their list so had to chase around people to find out what was going on. When i was seen (again no offer of a drink while i waited). I was then charged incorrectly, from the price given on the phone, not once but twice. The staff member was very apologetic and said the computer was wrong. When i did get my keys and paid, he walked me out and was very polite. My car was nicely cleaned and working well. The gentleman provided a good service and manner, however the initial vibe given wasn't pleasant. I felt like i was a burden to them. If i came to this site originally to buy a car i would of left without purchasing. although i think it is more impressive looking than the Chatham site, I feel their service was much more welcoming from my first step on the forecourt through to the end and even now when i have to revisit! (hence i bought my car on my first visit there)"
1/23/18,5,Excellent presales support by Inchcape when purchasing my new TT RS. They pulled out all the stops for me and did everything they said they would. A far better experience than with some other (non-Audi) dealers. :-)
1/23/18,1,"They take 4-6 weeks to schedule small jobs (blown headlamp bulb) and took 8 weeks to fix a major issue because they didn't know about the vehicles they sell. They damaged the car when in for service which they had on film and still deny. Can't trust them on anything!

Thanks for replying that I should contact Hunters. Been there done that and got nowhere and I note on the site a great many reviewers have had the same experience."
1/23/18,5,"As this was a repeat visit I only had 1 problem to resolve, which was handled quickly and without fuss."
1/23/18,5,"there were no problems during my recent MOT experience, staff were attentive and helpful, MOT was done in the time allowed, altogether the experience was painless"
1/23/18,1,Tried to buy a car from these people and they screwed me around. I don't recommend them at all. I made it clear what the mileage and condition of my current car was and that the deal was dependent on a part exchange. They dithered about for a while not returning my calls which I guess should have been a clue. Finally I had a quote from them and accepoted it. Gave them a £500 deposit. When I came to collect the car they said they had made a mistake entering the mileage into the computer and my car was worth £1200 less than they had offered. Tried to get me to take out a loan for the £2500 to cover the difference. Then agreed to offer me £200 more and asuumed I would just say yes to the paying an extra £1000. Unbelievable!
1/22/18,1,"I am unable to give this company zero stars so 1 will have to do.
The company is based in Cheshire Oaks and I can’t comment on the rest of the group just yet. I tried 3 times to get an appointment to discuss car purchase options. I was told on 3 occasions that someone would contact me, no one did. When I eventually booked my appointment and test drive, I reported to the receptionist who told me to take a seat. 10 minutes later, the company rang me, at the showroom, to ask me to identify myself as they were unaware who or where I was, I did this by waving my hands in the air as requested. I am unsure of the salespersons name but he was far from professional. I practically had to tell him his job. After discussing cars. I asked for test drive. I was Informed that the model I wanted was not available to test drive. The salesperson informed me that one would be available in the afternoon or the next day and he would ring me to let me know. 2days on, I’m still waiting for that call.. oh dear, I think that my sales person may have been trained by Arthur Daly and co.
I am also disabled and the company has 3 disabled bays, all were occupied by demo cars. I am so disappointed with this particular showroom and staff.. totally inept and incompetent.

I have now gone to ‘Inchcape’ in Warrington, and so far, so good. Watch this space. Avoid ‘Inchcape’ @ Cheshire Oaks.. you can do better elsewhere. Liverpool, Warrington, Manchester etc. It’s well worth paying a few extra pounds in fuel just to avoid this company @ Cheshire Oaks."
1/22/18,5,"I took my BMW 318i to have some boydwork checked and certified and I sat in comfort and was able to get myself a hot drink and read my book for the hour that it took to inspect it, clean it and give the car a visual health check. One thing came up in the visual health check which was that I needed two rear tyres as one was illegal and one was just legal! So thank you Mini at Tonbridge for telling me. They also gave me a quote for the tyres."
1/22/18,5,"Excellent, efficient & friendly service can't fault them one bit, went above and beyond what was required! Well recommended."
1/22/18,5,Love the new car - sales (Caroline) and service team were really good. Will definitely use again.
1/22/18,5,"Great customer service, seamless purchasing process and great value vehicle. Will definitely buy again through Inchcape Nottingham."
1/22/18,5,"Great service - friendly, helpful and professional."
1/22/18,5,"Car was delivered to Cooper BMW Ipswich essentially dead just before close of business on January 29th 2017. Staff, especially Charlotte & Victoria went above & beyond staying late to ensure the car was secure & booked in. Very Knowledgeable, professional & Friendly service

Work was completed on the next working day ( 2nd January) & I was back on the Road.

Excellent Experience, Many Thanks."
1/22/18,5,Vey satisfied with the service provided
1/21/18,5,"Really helpful staff. Kimberley was very friendly, really efficient and helped to rectify any problems in a timely manner. Will definitely use Macclesfield Audi for the servicing of my car as well as future car purchases."
1/21/18,3,"Booking and the MOT done timely.
Get the feeling when discussing issues with the front line staff that there is a lack of any basic in-depth knowledge of the mechanics of the vehicles.
The courtesy cleaning, normally of a fairly high order - from experience in the past - was quite shocking."
1/21/18,4,"Good customer service, however Hunters had to disconnect the battery and then did not reset the clock, its the little things that count with a Range Rover, i expected this sort of thing to be corrected before I collected the car."
1/21/18,5,"I have been a customer of Mercedes Benz @ their previous branch in Chester, and now at Cheshire Oaks. Their customer service has gone from strength to strength, which is against the usual trend of when a Retailer expands. They make you feel like a VIP, they will always go the extra mile to ensure a smooth experience. I was getting the illuminated star fitted, and had booked in to wait with the vehicle, however the evening before they called to say it may take longer than anticipated and had arranged a loan Car, to save me waiting.. above and beyond.. Thank you to the whole team"
1/21/18,5,"More than the extra mile, top class service and an amazing ability to turn problems into a super happy customer experience. Thank you Steve Pike and all the staff at Hunters Landrover from me and Dolly 2."
1/20/18,4,Great customer service from Barry at Coopers Thames Ditton. No hard sell and helped orchestrate the surprise to my wife when I brought her in to pick up the car.
1/20/18,5,"Have been a customer of Inchcape Colchester since 2013. VW Golf supplied by this company and all servicing, MOTs and the odd minor repair work carried out here. Prices reasonable for a main agent; staff invariably pleasant, courteous and helpful to my wife and me, both of us now in our mid seventies."
1/20/18,3,Kept waiting.... why can’t I just leave my keys and sign any paper work with reception. I really don’t need to see so many just to do such a simple task.
1/20/18,5,They do exactly what is needed and keep you informed of what is going on. I have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone who has a BMW and values how it is looked after.
1/20/18,5,excellent service
1/20/18,5,An extremely efficient and helpful sales executive sources the perfect car
1/20/18,5,Amazing advisor and technician. Done everything asked and very quickly. Highly recommended
1/20/18,5,"The customer care/service staff are excellent, nothing is too much trouble to be of assistance to you."
1/20/18,5,Great service as always and very efficient staff.
1/20/18,5,"The staff in Cooper Colchester from the manager to the receptionist are friendly and helpful. The sales team ( I dealt with Emma and Hilary) are very knowledgeable and efficient, and my trade-in and purchase went very smoothly. Highly recommended!"
1/20/18,1,"Lots of waiting, at reception on arrival, for Service receiver who showed no urgency when he turned up and same on collection which took an hour when they had called to say the car was ready. Apparently blocked in and they couldn't find keys to the blocker. Complained and head man tried to expedite. He apologised but their systems build in delay and nobody seems to care.A huge management challenge to sort this out. I will never go there again."
1/20/18,1,My 2 year old Mercedes has been into the Mercedes Inchcape dealer in Stratford 4 times in 6 months . They cannot fix it and engine management light stills comes on . Keep giving it back saying it’s fixed and it isn’t . Don’t bring it here they are not mechanics or even close . Don’t be fooled by the fancy showroom!
1/20/18,5,Great straight forward service from start to finish. Really helpful and polite staff.
1/19/18,5,"I was looked after really well by Leon, he was kind, professional and really helped me in any way that he possibly could! I would recommend Cheshire Oaks Audi to absolutely anyone!"
1/19/18,5,Fab customer service
1/19/18,5,Maidstone Audi are fantastic. The sales staff are very polite and friendly. The service I received was spot on. I can’t recommend them highly enough
1/19/18,5,Excellent from booking to collection. Thank you Oliver and Alicia good work.
1/19/18,5,Perfect people
1/19/18,5,Excellent service
1/19/18,5,From my initial enquiry to ordering my new car and collecting it the customer service has been excellent
1/19/18,5,Excellent service
1/19/18,5,"We recently purchased a second hand Audi A4. The sales staff were friendly and efficient and the prices for both my trade in and for the ""new car were very competitive.
The Audi was well prepared and was available on time to enable us to complete the purchase promptly."
1/19/18,5,Fantastic service from all the staff. Colin on the service desk always knows exactly what you need when you call and always tries to make sure your paperwork’s ready when you arrive.
1/19/18,5,Just great service - simple as !
1/19/18,5,very good and nice experience was completely satisfied with how everything went
1/19/18,5,Excellent experience from start to finish. My BMW was booked in for an M.O.T over the phone which was dealt with efficiently and when I took the vehicle in I was served quickly and politely. They rang as agreed later in the day to say that the vehicle was ready to be collected having passed. It had also been cleaned and vacuumed. Promptly dealt with the paperwork and escorted back to vehicle. Excellent
1/19/18,5,First time I’ve used collect and return service - brilliant and so convenient
1/19/18,5,"I was impressed with the service I received. The only negative was the site that I could log onto to find out about what stage my car was at in its journey from factory to show room. This site was of little value.

I initially set out to replace my BMW with another of the same make. For various reasons I visited the Audi showroom in Maidstone and was soon thinking more seriously about my car choice. I was impressed with the staff and especially the salesperson - Mike Taylor. The service throughout has been good and my initial impressions of my new car are highly favourable."
1/19/18,5,Brilliant experience
1/19/18,5,Excellent service in all aspects.
1/19/18,5,"Car was in for a service and MOT.
I was seen promptly and the paperwork dealt with efficiently.
I subsequently had a telephone conversation to agree some additional work and received a video on line.
The service was completed quickly and I was contacted to advise that the car was ready.
Overall all handled very well without any problems."
1/19/18,5,"huge thanks to waist hand of Croydon Cooper Bmw .
thank you again for your help in finding us a suitable
car."
1/19/18,5,Very good service all around
1/18/18,5,"My visit to inchcape, was very good, staff was knowledgeable and friendly."
1/18/18,4,Very helpful when my issue was looked at on the same day but only criticism was that initially it felt that because i had come in without an appointment (had a tyre problem) i didn't fit into their planned day. I was told to try and resolve the issue myself or drive to BMW Chelmsford. This was despite my tyre being completely unfit for driving. The person advising this didn't even look at the tyre when saying this.
1/18/18,5,"I found the level of service, knowledge and advice of the people I saw were invaluable to my experience of VW Inchcape VW. I met with a customer service/sales rep and the engineer who investigated my car. Excellent service between the two of them."
1/18/18,5,"Good efficient service, excellent friendly staff."
1/18/18,5,"The excellent service started with the initial booking and continued right through to the final payment. Mark is effective, efficient and friendly. BMW are very expensive but at the end of the day you get what you pay for."
1/18/18,5,"Extremely professional, efficient."
1/18/18,5,1st class service. Special thanks to Nigel Carr who couldn’t do enough to help.
1/18/18,4,"Very efficient overall.

I was kept fully informed of progress on servicing car, and on other issues over warranty claims

In short it all happened as it should do, that doesn't always happen in other dealer service departments"
1/18/18,5,First class service as expected.
1/18/18,5,all good thanks
1/18/18,4,"The overall process was well managed with efficient and knowledgeable staff. The only adverse comment I have to make is that as soon as I picked up the car, I had to put £45 petrol into it! When the car cost c£22k the amount of £45 is insignificant, and yet, this is the last memory of the entire process and left a bad taste in my mouth; rather than feeling elated at driving away with a new car, I felt a tinge of resentment. I feel consideration should be given to ensuing each car has a full tank of petrol even if you pass the cost on to the customer elsewhere. I left my exchange car with you with a full tank!"
1/18/18,5,Excellent service very polite reception
1/18/18,5,"Despite my car warning me in 1000 miles in advance that I needed to service my car, I left it until I only had 100 miles to go before booking the service. I was therefore pleasantly surprised when I was offered an appointment in 2 days and with a courtesy car, meaning I did not overrun the service interval. I explained that I needed to pick my children up from school at 2pm and they arranged for the service to be completed on time. The member of staff who managed my booking and ensured that I received reminder texts was extremely professional and pleasant and ensured that everything ran extremely smoothly, thank you."
1/18/18,5,"Cooper Mini Norwich recently serviced my car. The whole process from my initial phone call to make the booking, arrangement of a loan car and service on the day were excellent. All of the staff were helpful and friendly, a very good experience all round. Many thanks."
1/18/18,5,"Car purchasing made easy, great staff to help you, in my case Jon Taylor who was considerate and very helpful, no pressure, overall a good experience, this is my fourth car purchase from Coopers Norwich
Highly recommended, good vehicles as well.

1/18/18,5,"All done to specification, on time and nice clean car too!"
1/18/18,4,"unfortunately my satnav was not repaired, as had been specifically requested. everything else was excellent"
1/18/18,4,Love the free health check. Car was like new wen I picked it up due to the clean inside and out.
1/17/18,5,"This was my first service of a new VW (admittedly following huge problems with a previous car - which were eventually sorted out to my satisfaction), and this experience was really good. Like many people I do not expect a lot from car dealers once they have sold the car, albeit with free services for x years etc etc etc. But, I have to say this went extremely well. I was met by someone in the car park before 8am, who was expecting me, who then gave me the name of the person in charge of my service. I thought this OTT, but that person, Henry, was actually really rather good - he was friendly, efficient, and ridiculously helpful throughout the entire process. He told me what was and wasn't wrong with my car, kept me informed throughout, and even recommended a local café whilst I waited. Trust me, I'm pretty scathing about car dealers, and have been about this one in the past - but I cannot fault my experience this time. Christine"
1/17/18,4,Great stock and delighted with our new car! Overall a good experience and Joe Walsh was very accommodating to our needs! Very happy customer!
1/17/18,5,"Great Communication at every step.
Fast and quick service booking in, dropping car off and completing job. only down side was waiting for member of staff to become available to hand back the car. had to wait approx. 30 mins. which although had a lovely brew whilst waiting really needed to get back home."
1/17/18,5,"As with all things in life, if you go to the experts in their field, you wont be disappointed. Before I started using Lexus Guildford, I (and I suspect many others) imagined the costs would be prohibitive. Not so; The time saved through their knowledge of their products and the personal service is well worth the extra. Can fully understand why they continually receive awards and accolades."
1/17/18,5,Well received in a plush environment and introduced to a service rep. The booking in of the car was simple and well organised. Coffee was offered. I received feedback through my mobile to advise on progress. Car was available at stated time. Car was valeted. Main dealer is more expensive but could not fault the service.
1/17/18,5,Serviced on time and finished within a good time .A lift up to the shop was an added bonus as we were prepared for a long walk there.
1/17/18,5,Fantastic service from Cooper Mini Reading! Repaired car quickly and then checked over thoroughly. My car was also seen only a couple of days after I rang. George in particular was really friendly. Thank you!
1/17/18,4,Car picked up on time and delivered back again on time. Service appears to be fine but as an amateur it's difficult to tell how well it's been done. You have to rely on the service engineers. MOT done as requested. No complaints really except that the multifunction display was left on a settings submenu and I was advised to read the manual to find out how to restore the original display. Not hard but why not return it with the original display and save me the trouble?
1/17/18,5,Was booked in for a MOT and Service and had excellent service from the point of booking to picking my car up.
1/17/18,5,excellent and quick service while I wait
1/17/18,5,I’m very satisfied about My car service thank you

1/17/18,5,Excellent service from great staff.
1/17/18,5,"As always, brilliant, helpful service!!"
1/17/18,5,Great service and comucation. Met all my expectations
1/17/18,1,"My experience was exactly the same as Nick's below. Turned up for a pre-arranged test drive, Steven was off sick and no-one else knew about it. Had already taken me 10 minutes to find somewhere to park and then, as per Nick's review, I'd been blocked in and someone had to go in search of keys to remove the car and let me out. Thought I would like to buy an upmarket car but customer service doesn't seem to go with it."
1/17/18,5,Excellent Service
1/17/18,5,"All the staff at Tetbury Audi are very professional, efficient and friendly. they go our of their way to explain everything - even the occasional problem. Communication is first class. The whole environment is clean, tidy and bright and the coffee is excellent."
1/17/18,4,RECEPTION PLEASANT AND EFFICIENT AND HAND BACK GOOD
1/17/18,5,"Had a great experience throughout booking and service. Treated well, everything thoroughly explained, regular contact made throughout process by Billy to keep me updated on what needed doing. A little more expensive than the local garage but you certainly get what you pay for."
1/17/18,4,"Did speak to Audi over the phone so they could get me booked in & also requested a hire car.
Went in on the day, they had to reschedule as no courtesy car was arranged.
Came back 2 days later they sorted out a hire car unfortunately wasn't able to get a courtesy car that was like for like so just had to take the A1 instead.
MOT passed, recalls performed & overall pretty happy experience apart from the initial stage where they had to reschedule.
Also note that any timing belt done by Audi the MOTs for that car are free for life."
1/17/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish
1/17/18,5,"It is not my first time to be in the west London VW branch .
Very good customer service.
Definitely recommended."

5 * Top class service,,,thank you cooper BMW :-)"
1/17/18,5,"Very courteous and efficient, couldn't ask for more."
1/17/18,5,"Having decided on purchasing winter wheels and tyres had researched costs not for BMW equipment. Rang parts dept at Coopers, very helpful, gave me options and came up with a good deal. Ordered. Service dept rang me a few days later to arrange fitment. Few days later I went to dealership. All fitted in a timely manner. Everyone I dealt with was polite and helpful. Job done as estimated. No delays or issues."
1/17/18,4,Arranged a taxi to get me to my work and then delivered car back to me at work once the service was completed.
1/17/18,5,"My car door was creaking..telephone booking was very efficient. They rang back immediately, as they said they would.

Very quickly dealt with on the day, a very minor adjustment, but they washed and hoovered car as well."
1/17/18,5,"Extremely efficient helpful service

1/17/18,5,"Excellent Services and price. very friendly and welcoming.
Love the idea they show video clip of my vehicle for inspecting and good wash up of my Golf R makes it looks new!!!"
1/17/18,1,"Really nice car, pity about the poor sales team and after sales experience. I spent £36K on my new car and it was a no frills experience, BMW were hands down a better dealer when it comes to customer service and after sales experiences."
1/16/18,5,Very good service and helpful and friendly service manager - Andrea. Thank you
1/16/18,5,Hunters Southampton. Top quality customer care and service.

Thanks Very Much

Really looking forward to my new Driving Experience

1/16/18,4,Excellent reception from the guys at Tetbury. Very good product knowledge helped us make a choice quickly. The only downside was that we were told they had found a Q5 to our specification but when it was delivered it had the wrong colour upholstery ( grey whereas we wanted black)
1/15/18,5,Excellent service and helpfulness
1/15/18,5,"Had my vehicles first service performed by the West London, Brentford dealership and the whole experience, from actually making the booking to having the service performed was absolutely wonderful. Tom, who made the booking was very efficient and went over and above by speaking to the dealership to see if they could squeeze this service in as they initially said they were fully booked. Upon arriving, Mo, who handled the booking, was also very efficient and ensured the service was performed swiftly, as I don't live locally, to ensure I didn't have to wait around too long. He kept me abreast of progress and gave me a full rundown of the service before taking payment. Finally, the price was very fair and was the main reason for me using this branch as my local dealer, who is friendly, always seems very unaccommodating and charges more than most other dealers. My local dealer really could learn a thing or two from this branch. Overall, a very satisfied customer who will definitely return in the future."
1/15/18,4,Really good service from Lexus Guildford. Easy to book on-line and the staff were polite and helpful. Even the cost was bearable thanks to my Lexus Service Plan!
1/15/18,5,"An excellent service from Adam and his team, making a well informed and stress free experience. And as for the car....... soooo very pleased with my Mini Cooper and absolutely loving it. Thanks again Adam"
1/15/18,5,"Service excellent. Polite friendly staff. Used the lift back home service as booked, no waiting very prompt will use again Car was in for service and I requested if possible could the car be ready for a certain time this wasn't a problem, Video sent to me ref service inspection by technician. All in all an excellent service from this dealership, I would recommend."
1/15/18,5,"Polite, Friendly, less than quote and ready before promised"
1/15/18,5,called in with burst tyre and was dealt with quickly and efficiently - thank you
1/15/18,5,"Jessica Elliott is a superstar! I met a number of sales people from different manufacturers but Jess at Audi Tunbridge Wells put them all to shame! Fantastic service, went above and beyond but also gave genuine advice rather than just trying to sell at all costs! Great showroom and responsive team."
1/15/18,5,"Excellent friendly service from Oliver Potts, he kept me informed all the way through a great experience and very professional."
1/15/18,5,"The usual great service I have come to expect at Mercedes Benz of Leicester. Friendly, helpful and efficient, and a very good price for minor accident repair. Thanks to all the team."

1/15/18,5,"Helpful, efficient and friendly. Could not habe asked for more"
1/15/18,5,First class service and staff. They even helped us set up the mobile phone on hands free
1/15/18,2,"I was asked to come at certain times. I reached there and was first served by a service desk employee Mr. Bilal to whom I asked to move a couple of things when they clean my car. I was also promised a full velet which also was not done. Also I was given 90 minutes of time to finish the servicing as well cleaning the car which ran into more than 120 minutes. I noticed that other people were waiting for longer time then expected. After that I was served by another service personnel Ms. Mica who advised me that my car was ready bu when I saw the car it was still dripping from all around and according to Mica the cleaning staff was very slow hence she had to hoover my car herself. When I got into my car I saw the cleaning quality was very poor. There was nothing moved and cleaned and there was no valet carried out. Dash and gear controls and other places were dusty. I could not go in ask for another cleaning job as I was already running late.
Some really good people work at that dealer i.e. Gareth (GSM) and Lee Jones (Used car sales Manager) who make efforts to satisfy customers at their level best but often Service department and others ruined the reputation."
1/15/18,3,"Waited too long (3 hours) for a simple service - winter checkup and one tyre change. Yes the tyre was in stock.
Was left sitting and not kept up to date with progress. Technicians could not locate wheel nut key. In the place where BMW had placed it when I bought the vehicle.
Not as good as other BMW dealers I have used in the past."
1/15/18,4,"Just the same as always, need better chairs in waiting area. Not very sensible for sharing while waiting."
1/15/18,5,"Good service ,David Groves the sales executive was very helpful & informative,highly recommend."
1/15/18,5,"Excellent customer service, this garage is outstanding and always goes the extra mile to ensure the work carried out is fast class and the team in service/ sales are exceptional. It's always a pleasure to take the vehicle to Cooper Malton BMW."
1/15/18,5,"Took the car for a free winter check, included wash and vacuum inside. Booked an appoitment to suit us. Pleasant, polite service, coffee served while waiting and Winter check bag with cleaners inside to take home. Excellent as always."
1/15/18,4,Good Service
1/15/18,5,"Myself, Dad and Partner visited Chelmsford Mini Dealership and we were welcomed by Sales Executive: Yasmin Bergmanis who from the first time meeting to the very end of when I drove off in my new car was - attentive, kind, knowledgable and professional. We were and still are impressed with the professionalism from all staff and Yasmin Bergmanis, the whole process felt very quick, easy and stress free!!! I couldn’t recommend this branch enough and Yasmin. P.S - I LOVE MY CAR :)

From Emily Devenish and Family."
1/15/18,5,Fantastic from start to finish.
1/15/18,5,"The MOT of my vehicle was carried out with the usual efficiency I have come to expect from the Tunbridge Wells branch.
The car was clean and ready when I called to collect it."
1/15/18,5,Will Clarke was exceptional from minute one of original phone call to them.
1/15/18,3,"Managed to order the parts and picked them up the next day, but I could not get the technical information I needed even though it stated in my car handbook that the dealership would provide that information. One of the workshop technicians was asked to help but the information offered was wrong."
1/15/18,5,"Very pleased with the way my wife and I were made to feel welcome at lnchcape chester,the service and work on my car was excellent as were the staff. I was surprised how different two VW dealerships could be. Sixty miles each way but well worth it, I will be calling again."
1/15/18,5,"Gary was brilliant. Really nice to deal with and at no point did I feel under pressure to buy! He was very knowledgeable on the product, very efficient and went above and beyond what was required. In addition to this I also love the car! Thanks"

We were welcomed and made to feel at home."
1/15/18,5,"Maidstone Audi were brilliant. They guided me through the whole purchase of my car, were friendly and very helpful."
1/15/18,5,Excellent service

1/15/18,1,"I tried to purchase a Brand new Range Rover Sport from them they were advertising,

Called 5 times over the weekend and e-mailed them. Not one return call and was constantly being told by Tracey on reception that Graham would call me and she promised without fail I would I would get a call by close of play yesterday>>>>> you've guessed it another day on and still no call.
What awful customer service, do not buy from them, its the only way they will take notice"
1/15/18,3,"Recently had my 3rd service, purchased an extended warranty at point of sale, on booking i informed them the rear wiper was not working, was told i would need to pay for them to find the fault, when i pointed out the extended warranty, they suddenly announced the fault had been fixed at no cost....i should not have had to tell them, very poor.........only good point was the vehicle was collected and returned to me within a decent time scale, i do feel their system is not very accurate in terms of information.

I had to have the air con unit replaced within 4 months of the purchase and i have since been bombarded with emails and phone calls saying my air con needs doing......again lack of communication on their system!

Doubt i will use in future!"
1/15/18,5,"From the moment we purchased our car, the company have been brill.
we had First MOT, end of three year warranty check done and car was washed and cleaned out as well, We would purchase another Mini if so, as this is best car we have owned, the after service is brill as well."
1/15/18,5,Great Service

1/14/18,5,Excellent service and experience all round
1/14/18,5,"I had my 4 year old 2/0 Litre Diesel Tiguan MOT's at Inchcape Volkswagen at Chelmsford this week. A better class of customer service would be hard to beat. As I am with them on a service plan, the actual MOT is FOC ,but I had asked for a curtesy car to drive whilst the test was on . This was waiting for me after I had dropped my own car off . All paperwork was ready to sign ,I had arrived and then departed in all of 20 mins.
Inchcape kept me informed during the Test by sending me both a text and a short video clip of the test results and any future work that will need to be undertaken. On return my car was waiting , cleaned with the report and MOT handed to me as I picked up the keys, from Christine the service rep.
This is service of the very highest calibre, I would recommend Inchcape to anyone in the area seeking relibility and trouble free servicing.
Jeff of Brentwood"
1/14/18,5,"Excellent service from reception staff, all items of service were covered and feedback received on future items required.
Car was available on time as promised."
1/14/18,4,"Great service, however you are paying for it"
1/14/18,1,"Katia was great, but sales manager was the rudest I've ever seen. Admin staff got my full name messed up on V5. Manager promised on the phone to fix it. Still waiting after 3 weeks."
1/13/18,5,"First class from driving in to driving out.
I was kept updated throughout the service"
1/13/18,5,"Situation:- partial flat tyre on Touraeg. I had purchased Tyer insurance through Inchape.
Review:- Jordan had the competence and capability to have the tyre inspected, photographs sent to Inchape tyre insurance and have the Tyer delivered and fitted that afternoon. I simply handed the car over and picked it up paying the £10 excess only on a £250 Tyer."
1/13/18,2,"Would not disclose the price of the service before booking despite many requests which were ignored, however this was the first service so I wanted the manufacturer to do it so I went ahead despite the rude attitude of their staff.
£282 for what? No breakdown of what they did for that amount, only a pointless video which showed the underside of my car and a bloke telling me there is ""plenty of miles left on my break pads"" Define ""plenty"" please? Enough to the next service or what?
Not a great experience and not value for money."
1/13/18,5,"Car collected serviced and returned as agreed, I had a nominated contact, James who kept me informed, ie when car had been serviced and time it was due to be returned. Pleasant and courteous price as agreed plus an extra for corroded wheel nuts which I was advised of up front."
1/13/18,5,"Excellent experience as usual, with friendly staff taking care of me and providing information when asked or if they need to tell me about anything I should know. On completion of the MOT my car was cleaned and it came back looking great. Well done."
1/13/18,5,Nicholas Bibby was a pleasure to deal with and explained everything in detail making our first purchase of a Land Rover car easy. My wife and I would certainly recommend Hunters and Nicholas Bibby to our family and friends
1/13/18,1,Disappointing will not use you again try calling me you wont like my comments going public
1/13/18,5,"Very friendly service, great communication, just very expensive!"
1/13/18,5,"I started using HA Fox Jaguar, Guildford about two years ago for both my personal and work Jaguar. It was a good decision and I intend to continue in the future. In fact, I had a good few hours with one of their sales team the other day when my XKR was being serviced and can say they are equally up to the standard of the service team, which is excellent.
Jaguar is a great brand and product, when sold/serviced by HA Fox it becomes sublime!
Many thanks to Steve and his excellent service team. Also for the great advice from Martyn in sales, and who knows, we might be looking at yet another Jaguar, hope so....thanks all."

I didn't get any of the usual sales pressure from Louis who I dealt with, relaxed approach from the start which was very refreshing and nothing was too much trouble for him despite my constanty changing spec. Great communication throughout and in the end I received the exact car that I was looking for. Handover was great and there was even a suprise gift in the boot for our little boy. Would definitely recommend this dealership."
1/12/18,5,"The staff here are very friendly and considerate. You are never left to wait and always offered good advice.
Thank you"
1/12/18,5,fantastic customer service
1/12/18,5,"Excellent service plus ..nice coffee/cakes and a return lift to Tetbury could not fault it


But watch the price they matched Cheltenham Audi that was £50 cheaper on a basic service."
1/12/18,3,"Promised a call to let me know when the car was ready - never received any phone call. That is usual from Inchcape Macclesfield, they rarely return calls."
1/12/18,5,"Apart from a short wait, Christine who dealt with my vehicle was a super representative for Inchcape VW and made my visit an absolute pleasure. Anyone dealing with this young lady will be charmed by her approach and knowledge."
1/12/18,5,"Excellent and prompt customer care from Service and reception staff as always. Josh in service department was brilliant throughout nothing was a problem. Brenda, the face of Cooper for many years always a pleasure to deal with. Thanks again"
1/12/18,5,First service was handled well from start to finish. Response from service desk on the phone was efficient and business like. I was told how long the service would take and what time car would be available. I was greeted promptly and process explained . All very polite and as expected based on recommendations I have had
1/12/18,5,"Took my car in for service. Staff manages to fit me in last minute. Service manger was extremely helpful. Service was completed promptly and on time. My car was cleaned and valet completed to a great standard which was complementary.
Also picked up the car just before closing time, yet they still had time to find me a sales advisor to talk to me about a new car enquiry.
Would def use again!!!"
1/12/18,5,Excellent Service
1/12/18,5,"My VW Golf went in for its first service and the team at Colchester were very efficient and professional. I had no trouble booking it in, had helpful reminders, and was able to collect it on time with no inconvenience to me at all. The little video clip that was sent to me showing the progress of the service was very good too."
1/12/18,5,Excellent service throughout
1/12/18,5,"Very pleased with the service, booked car in it was attended to very prompt and on time, the service desk was very friendly and helpful."
1/12/18,5,"Efficient and fast service.
All staff are helpful and friendly.
Car was ready at specified time."
1/12/18,5,"Staff courteous, helpful, and patient. Completed the repair,washed and valeted the car within the time notified."
1/12/18,5,Everything done as planned to a good standard
1/12/18,4,Deborah was very helpful and did everything she could to try and help.
1/12/18,4,"They seem to be too busy , Staff seems to be very rushed and robotic . I used to like this place a year ago, but recently felt Cooper Cobham BMW has lost that personal touch it had with customers . Well , may be they are too busy to even bother .
I went in for a regular service and they did take good care of my car as far as I know ."
1/12/18,5,All work done to correct spec - not cheap but good to know it's done properly.
1/12/18,5,"Got very good service, was looked after the moment I walked in the showroom, went through everything and asked when I needed to pick the car up and it was ready on time and job well done"
1/12/18,4,"The repair which was carried out to my scuffed front bumper was of excellent quality and I am extremely pleased with the result.
However I was very surprised that my car had not been valeted, either on the interior or exterior, when returned to me.
The valeting process has been in the past, a normal part of a service or repair visit.
I hope this is a one off omission and not a decline in the very high standards that anyone who owns a Lexus expects."
1/12/18,5,The service provided by my Hunter’s salesman was informative and non pushy. I was prepared to look for a vehicle nationally but was delighted to be able to use my local JLR company.
1/12/18,5,Efficent while you wait service on my Passat all done in 2 hours no issues well done!
1/12/18,5,"Great efficient service, they did exactly what they said they were going to do and I was kept informed totally"
1/12/18,5,Excellent response to servicing needs from initial phone call to handover of my vehicle spot on time
1/12/18,5,A polite and friendly service with complimentary coffee and a relaxed seating area with space to work.
1/12/18,4,Very good Customer service! One downside was that I was past from salesman to salesman and told a few different things so there was abit of confusion!
1/12/18,2,"Don't arrive at 8am, they won't be ready.
They also need to understand the basic rules of 'first come, first served'"
1/12/18,5,"Arranged pick up and delivery for annual service, was contacted prior to pick up to arrange specific time slot, car was picked up within specified time slot and was returned earlier than expected. Car was returned valeted inside and out. Excellent service, as ever."
1/12/18,5,The service and reception received could not have been better - thanks to all concerned.
1/12/18,5,I have used Inchcape VW Bolton for my car servicing for many years and have always had an excellent service. It also helps when the staff are courteous and know what they are talking about if you do have a problem.
1/12/18,5,"As normal great service and very professional people, especially the young lady on the Service reception and the technician who accompanied myself to my wife's car to discuss any problems."
1/12/18,4,"I can not fault the attention I revived was greeted very courtesly by staff.
Kepted in touch of what was happening with regards to my car."
1/11/18,5,"Excellent customer service and highly delighted with our new car, the whole experience was very straightforward and Martin was very helpful and accommodating, would highly recommend."
1/11/18,5,"The recall on my BMW 120I 2007 was dealt with expertly by a chap called James,
I recieved a fantastic replacement car for the duration of the work completed on my car.
Nothing is too much trouble for this dealetship and i highly recommend them."
1/11/18,2,Quoted way over standard price compared to other Audi dealerships. They did remedy at payment. Part did not turn up so wasted revisit. Managed to reschedule the following day after previously not being an option. Staff apologetic but not a great experience & wasted 3 hours of my day
1/11/18,5,"I was made to feel very comfortable throughout, Steve Nichols looked after my booking from start to finish and my car was ready as promised, superb, many thanks."
1/11/18,1,Unacceptable but the young woman who dealt with us was polite and pleasant. I have written detailed feedback to the manager. The business needs a good look at itself. I shall be interested to see if I get a response to my emailed feedback.
1/11/18,4,"Excellent service by all from the Customer Service Representative to Tom Hinchliffe, who originally sold me the car last year, and was happy to assist with my Bluetooth."
1/11/18,5,"As usual, it was the best experience. Phill is wonderful
All sorted perfectly"
1/11/18,5,Quick and loved the video of the car being checked
1/11/18,3,Reception/handover of car at start was fine. Collection time agreed for later that afternoon.Two calls received from Cooper during day firstly to relate cost details and secondly to say car was ready for collection. At that stage I stated the time I would arrive to take possession of car (1 hour hence). Having arrived at the dealership at the appointed time I was told car was not ready and was being valeted. I then waited over an hour before one employee handed me the keys and said they had been 'found on a hook on the board'. I also had to ask for for the complimentary winter pack which introduced a further delay. I eventually left with my car 1.5 hours after the appointed time. Not as slick as experienced before and nowhere near as professional as the local Mercedes garage that services our other car.
1/11/18,5,"Repair carried efficiently , and price quoted was price paid.
Staff extremely courteous. Would recommend this company"
1/11/18,5,"Excellent service.

My only comment would be that staff should be able to produce an ID when the vehicle is picked up from home.

J P Murphy"
1/11/18,5,Excellent customer service
1/11/18,5,Great people gave me the confidence that my car service was carried out professionally.
1/11/18,5,The customer service and communication I received from Hunters Landrover (Norwich) was exceptional. The work was carried out on my car to a very high level and the vehicle returned to me fully valeted.
1/11/18,2,"The winter check was fine but the collection and return arrangements were a shambles and this together with not registering a change in the day of the appointment with me result the that I was without the car for 8 hours and did not know when it was going to be collected or returned. Day wasted.

J Carleton"
1/11/18,5,"I have just bought a demonstrator from Crawley Audi and the experience was both professional and ‘human’, going the extra mile to help (Georgette Rydin and Phil Greco in particular). A happy customer indeed."
1/11/18,5,"I’ve just bought a used Mini One from Cooper Mini the customer service was great and Daryl in particular was very helpful from start to finish, I love the car and the overall buying experience was pain free. I would highly recommend Cooper Mini Tonbridge, and later on when I want to change my lovely Mini I would certainly visit there again."
1/11/18,2,"Everyone I spoke to was very polite so it is a shame that I was handed back a potentially dangerous car following a Longlife Service and Healthcheck, due to sidewall tyre bulge to one wheel. Apparently tyres not in stock but rather than phone me or my lease company Audi Swindon decided to do nothing. I was advised upon collection that the tyres needed replacing but this wasn't done because the lease company wouldn't authorise - not factually correct as it turned out. Massive inconvenience next day, changed work plans, phoned lease company, phoned Audi (no call back after several hours so had to phone again), arranged replacement tyres myself. I have received an apology by phone and told that this will be a 'learning curve' for the team. However, the consequences could have been far greater should I have experienced a tyre blow out on the way home. Extremely frustrating day and disappointing to say the least as I expect the best from Audi and in the past this has always been the case."
1/11/18,3,"I took my car in for an Mot on Tuesday morning. When I arrived, there was nowhere to park. The approach road was also full. I eventually had no option but to park on a Pub carpark nearby. I mentioned the problem to reception, they said they were aware of the problem but there was nothing they could do about it.
I was told by the service centre that it would take about an hour and a half to complete the MOT, clean and vacuum the car.
An hour and a half later I was told the car was ready. I went to the car and it had not been cleaned.
I had another appointment so I had to leave.
Getting back out of Mercedes car park was like an obstacle course with vehicles parked everywhere.
I have had my car serviced at Warrington before, the experience has been very good but this time very disappointing."
1/11/18,5,Kirsty Schofield was brilliant
1/11/18,5,Happy with the service. Good communication.
1/11/18,5,Superb service and customer care from poppy
1/11/18,5,Good customer service
1/11/18,5,Efficient service.
1/11/18,5,"Had some phone/email dealings today with Graham Shaw. I found him to be extremely helpful & professional, thank you. Andy Rouse"
1/11/18,5,Great experience
1/11/18,5,"Bought a car from these guys December 2009 and have had great service ever since. The car has been near perfect, but when it wasn't the Service Team (especially Nitesh) worked really hard to reduce the impact to me as much as possible. Highly recommended."
1/11/18,5,Received great service from Michael both during (as you'd expect) but also after the sale. Would have no reservation about going back to him again.
1/11/18,5,"Booking for car servicing was easy . Collect and returning the car at the exact time they said. Keep me informing by calling and texting about the servicing . Courtesy car wash was very good. Before the car was returning I was informed that the car was on the way. Another interesting part is servicing video ,first time experience for me.
Overall experience was quite satisfying
Thank you to Abbie ."
1/11/18,5,Good service
1/10/18,5,Highly recommend
1/10/18,4,Visited Inchcape Norwich on the 9 Jan 18 for a car repair and was treated very well.
1/10/18,5,"Great service and incredibly friendly. Car was in for a routine MOT and health check. Kellie made sure I could work in the customer area while I waited, and completed all the paperwork efficiently. Great experience, thank you"
1/10/18,5,"When I purchased my car from Inchape Chelmsford last year, I received superb service by all involved. Fast forward a year , service & MOT due, I can honestly say the customer service was spot on again. Christine welcomed, explained everything and kept in touch throughout the day. Car was ready to pick up early and I received a courtesy call today. Outstanding!
Thank you Inchape"
1/10/18,5,"The staff were very friendly, helpful and professional."
1/10/18,5,Very professional organisation.
1/10/18,5,"As always, excellent customer service, polite and friendly staff. Regular feedback on progress of service of vehicle and received informative video of issues found. Cannot fault."
1/10/18,5,Very good customer service
1/10/18,5,Prompt service. Returned my vehicle in time in excellent state. Service agent Mr. Mike Mawson was very good .Very pleased.
1/10/18,5,"First class service and car returned immaculately valeted. No trouble making an appointment, email reminders received, and car returned on time. No problem with recommending Volkswagen Shrewsbury to others."
1/10/18,5,"Excellent customer service from Christine & the team at Inchcape VW Chelmsford yesterday.
Worth the journey as my local dealer is not up to scratch!"
1/10/18,3,"I have purchased 2 cars from this branch.

Staff are always polite & friendly in person.

Poor service when i was booking in my car over the phone & it was 1 week in advance regarding a fault with the heater. Was asked if i required a courtesy car, which i did & it there was one available. Then was advised moments later that it wasn’t. Then was advised to book the car on the next day as there was a courtesy car available. Then the day prior to the car going in, received a phone call to confirm the appointment. No courtesy car available but could offer a drop off/lift.

Even when booking the car in for a service, they offer a courtesy car but never have one available at the last minute.

Yes im aware of availability/terms but i am finding it very unsatisfied even when my new car 3 days old occured a fault. Was misadvised over the phone when booking it in. Was not advised of the length of time diagnostics would take. Was advised that courtesy car had been arranged for me, last minute i was advised the car would take 2 hours to be diagnosed and no courtesy car available. Had to contact friends and family to see who would come to collect me.

Disappointed each time. Think i’ll be taking my car for its next service at a different VW Garage"
1/10/18,1,"Appaling. The car was collected for its inspection and a warranty claim. The warranty claim wasn't acknowledged. I then got a largely useless video telling me all was okay (again no recognition that the warranty claim was valid or not). The car reappeared without any phone calls and it had what i can only loosely say was a 'wash'. The dog could've washed it better, at least he could've cleaned an entire alloy wheel rather than half. They couldn't get their head around the number plate change the car had had despite VW themselves being aware of it 7 days after it occured. All i can say it thank god its out of warranty so it can go to a VW dealer elsewhere. Basically all it had was a drive into Bolton and a half hearted wash. Fantastic brand, awful dealers."
1/10/18,5,"Very good service, timely car servicing and very courteous staff"
1/10/18,5,Excellent experience with MOT. Collected/ delivered at no cost and sent a video showing tyre wear etc
1/10/18,5,"The customer care from Mercedes at Ellesmere Port is fantastic. My car had a recall for various updates and I had to wait for the service to be completed. I had work to do, so I didn’t really notice the time. I was offered a space to work, I was offered refreshments and I even had my car valeted (for free!). The staff are friendly and helpful. Thank you for making my wait such a pleasant experience!"
1/10/18,5,Excellent service - highly recommended
1/10/18,5,The service was very good and the qaulity of work is good.
1/10/18,5,"Very good service. Car was picked up & delivered back when I requested. Had a phone call the day before pick up to confirm & after the service was completed to discuss the work that had been done.
Would recommend to anyone"
1/10/18,4,My car was due a service and was booked in at a time to suit me. The work was carried out with no issues and the car returned having been thoroughly washed. The technician had also noted items to be aware of such as tyre wear. I had a decent cup of coffee while waiting for a short time to be seen. The representative who dealt with me was polite and knowledgeable explained everything well and walked me to my car. All for a reasonable price.
1/10/18,3,"I am a long time Inchcape Swindon VW customer, this is my fourth car from this supplier, but my recent experience was not up to the normal standards I had come to expect.
In plenty of time to get my first service, I rang to arrange an appointment which I knew would be about an hour in the workshop. During my booking i emphasised that I needed a a time that I could leave the car and wait at the dealer while the service was being carried out. I was told there was an available appointment and 11.00 on the day we agreed.
When I arrived at 10.55 for my appointment I was told that the workshop bays were all full and my car would not be ready until approximately 14.00. I was told that the appointment time meant time at the desk to talk to a service booker, not a time for work on the car to be commenced.
After some negotiation, I was told that I could be squeezed in at about 12.00 and my car would be ready just after 13.00. The dealer were not able to provide me with a lift back home where I could have arranged a lift back later to pick up my car.
I then wasted almost two hours and finally took my car back at 13.15. The different approaches from the telephone arrangement and the service I got at the dealer were extremely disappointing and time-wasting.
Not up to Inchcape's usual performance."
1/10/18,5,Friendly welcome followed by professional customer service. Thanks.
1/9/18,5,Excellent . Efficient and informative. Best garage I have ever dealt with including the purchase of the car last year.
1/9/18,5,"Super fast service when called in with a faulty headlight bulb. Polite, friendly and efficient. Many thank"
1/9/18,4,"Health Check on my car.
I do like the company and have been well looked after on previous visits. This time there were but minor issues and a slight inconvenience to the service. I would still recommend the company."
1/9/18,5,"Great smooth service, no pressured oversell, responsive and flexible able to meet our specific demands in a short space of time over a bank holiday 9 days from initial test drive to new car. Impressive great deal!"
1/9/18,4,"Normal service, noticed that service advisors were in short supply. Had to wait 20 minutes before the only advisor was free but there were many several other staff walking around doing what? It seems strange that one of the two staff on reception have to go and find the advisor in a back office!
Car well looked after and washed."
1/9/18,5,"Jon was very helpful and knowledgeable from the first enquiry phone call. He did what he said he was going to do, when he said he was going to do it.

Great Service and great car!

Thank you"
1/9/18,4,Really pleased with the courteous manner and efficiency of the staff at Audi at Cheshire Oaks
1/9/18,5,Helpful polite staff - managed to drop me at work to save having a courtesy car which was really helpful. A good customer experience - thank you
1/9/18,4,Good easy no probs
1/9/18,5,Just had an MOT and new tyres. Efficient and kept me well informed via a video. No waiting and very impressed with the service overall. Donna was very efficient and helpful.
1/9/18,5,Absolute 5 star service . I must say Luke Dean the service advisor that dealt with myself is a credit to your company. From dropping the car off in the morning Luke was an absolute star and couldn’t do enough to make sure everything about my visit to the dealership for service was spot on . Highly recommended to all thanks again
1/9/18,5,I would highly recommend Cooper Teesside BMW. I always find they provide a very efficient service from start to finish. Staff are helpful & I can always rely on my car having a full health check. Wouldn't take my car anywhere else.
1/9/18,5,"I enjoyed a very fast service, professional & helpful team, as always! Mark was brilliant.
Thank you"
1/9/18,5,A good all round experience. Car booked in and was able to collect it earlier than expected. Also received a reduction in price on part of the service required.
1/9/18,5,Mark was very effective in communicating before and after the MOT. We felt welcome and well looked after. Very pleased with the service
1/9/18,5,"I have always found the people here, from reception to service technicians, to be courteous and efficient. Not the cheapest service option, but I feel confident that my car is receiving first-class attention, and detailed records of work done are always provided."
1/9/18,3,"I would normally give them 4/5 stars, but they never cleaned or vacuumed the car as stated on the invoice (even though it is free/complimentary), and the air box cover was left loose, and would have fallen off if I never noticed it. Everything else was ok."
1/9/18,5,"Very pleased with level of service and attention to detail, all the way through booking service to completion."
1/9/18,5,"I have driven Mercedes Benz cars for more than 20 years and during that time have had wonderful service from both cars and Merc dealers. Yesterday, my beautiful car was collected, serviced and cleaned and then returned to me. No-one could improve on Mercedes in my opinion.
Many thanks."
1/9/18,5,"A first class service , simple as that , could not expect better"
1/9/18,5,Excellent customer service made buying a new car a great experienced. Went the extra mile to ensure private reg was transferred. Many thanks
1/9/18,5,"The whole ambiance is of a professional, friendly company wanting to make your experience at H A Fox a pleasure. Many thanks."
1/9/18,5,"Service from Mark was swift, professional & courteous. Car was cleaned well afterwards & I would highly recommend this dealership."
1/9/18,5,"Personal and friendly service throughout the purchase (and part exchange) of my new Audi A1, without being pushy. Harry was thorough and Claire, his manager picked up the final details. Before leaving with my new car, the centre manager spoke to me individually to check that I had been happy with the service I had received. Everyone, including reception staff, made me feel very welcome."
1/9/18,5,Very helpful and professional service . The video was a brilliant idea showing the inspection of my vehicle 🚗
1/9/18,5,"Car went in for a service and MOT. A usual, staff were courteous and welcoming. I couldn't really fault the process from beginning to end.
Excellent"
1/9/18,5,Great service as always
1/9/18,5,Been a customer for over 9 years and never had anything but excellent service. It’s a pleasure to go into as all staff are friendly and helpful. Would recommend anyone to use them as it’s a brilliant team to deal with
1/9/18,5,The car was collected on time The agent discussed the air conditioning service The vehicle was brought back in time
1/9/18,1,No one available to answer the phones in Leicester and no manners over the phone.Placed on hold without being told then cut off also being cold transferred without being told is seriously annoying.
1/9/18,5,Very efficient and friendly service.
1/9/18,5,Very helpful dealt with the problem excellent
1/9/18,2,"The booking for the service was very good. I was told that I could wait on the day as it wouldn’t take more than 90minutes.
I was contacted to confirm a few days before.
On the day of the service, although greeted, I was left queuing with many other people and only one member of staff. When served, the staff member did not appear to listen to me. He then said it would be ready at 5pm. It was lucky that I hadn’t planned on waiting! When I ‘phoned at 4pm to check on the progress, I was told that the car hadn’t even been looked at yet. Therefore I could have had my car for a whole day!
When I arrived 5pm I had a shorter wait than the morning. The car was well cleaned."
1/9/18,2,"Had brand new E class, Merc. Cheshire Oaks were unable to fix after 78 days in their workshop........
My new vehicle has an issue with the ME app the dealer needs to assist with. My phone calls have not been returned....."
1/9/18,4,"My car received its first service, service adviser very helpful and pleasant..explained everything.. Service/safety check completed. A very smooth operation.well done.. . P.s.1 year wash and vac was poor overall..!!!!!"
1/9/18,5,"Much impressed by efficiency, courtesy and service. The fact that, although what I required was relatively minor, my car was beautifully cleaned inside and out without any charge was indicative of exceptional service. Thank you all."
1/9/18,5,"Brilliant service every time I go in, not my closest VW garage but the one I’d recommend to anyone."
1/9/18,5,"Good service, always do a good job. The garage is busy and you have to wait a few minutes to hand in and collect the vehicle, report to main reception rather than wait at the service desk. Friendly team."
1/9/18,4,"Prompt service, no issues"
1/9/18,1,"I booked my Range Rover Evoque in Hunters Land Rover, Southampton on Thursday 4th January to have the rear screen washer repaired. The pump was working but no water was coming out of the jet.
I am visiting the UK from Menorca, Spain for a few weeks and the car is left hand drive and Spanish registered. It has only covered 11,000 miles but the warranty has expired. The mileage is so low the car has yet to have its first service.
I arrived at Hunters 09.30 as requested and half expected them to say take a seat, have a coffee and we will have a look while you are here but they asked me to leave it and they would call me when it was ready.
At 17.00 hours I had a call from the service reception to say they had not been able to fix the problem and they would need more time. I was told it could take up to 2 hours and that the hourly rate was £135 per hour plus VAT.
The following day at 15.00 I received a call to say the car was ready.
I was told they had to remove the roof lining to get to the problem.
The car has a glass roof and so the roof lining amounts to a small strip to one side which I find it hard to believe took over 2 hours to remove and replace.
I was then presented with a bill for £510, YES, £510.
I asked the service receptionist how much, honestly, would he would have expected to pay if he had taken his own car in for such a small problem. He didn't offer an answer.
When I dropped the car off I left a note to say while they had the rear tailgate open would they please spray some lubricant on the hinges as one of them was squeaking. Also, IF, and I emphasised IF, they had to remove the interior trim on the tailgate to get to the washer problem, could they remove something that was rattling inside when the tailgate was lifted.
It sounded like the head of a rivet had come off from when the number plates were originally fixed to the car.
These were very minor requests that should have cost very little.
If I had known it was going to cost so much I would not have bothered because when I am in Menorca it rarely rains and the rear wiper hardly gets used!!"
1/9/18,5,Really happy with the service and advice I received
1/9/18,5,"My BMW X1 was recently recalled for a software update. Cooper Norwich collected the car in the morning and successfully returned it well before the time I had requested. I needed to use the car at 4pm and it arrived back, valeted well before the time. Well done Cooper Norwich another successful piece of customer service thanks to Claire Hart who ensured that my needs were met."
1/9/18,5,"Great service! Timely, quick and very competent."
1/9/18,5,Thank you for looking after me when I bought my mini the other day. The car is gorgeous and Jack made the whole process a whole lot easier.
1/9/18,5,"Excellent customer service from front of house to purchasing a new car within our budget and no pushy sales people.
Very comfortable atmosphere and a lovely customer waiting area with refreshments well done Maidstone Audi 👍"
1/9/18,5,"Mini Norwich.
Always had my old mini serviced here but never purchased a car there until last week. First of all, they had loads of used cars to choose from. Found one I liked very quickly and at a good price. Got a fair/average price for my trade in. Service was really good. Not pushy, lots of guidance and honest (thanks Lee).
I'll certainly be returning again."
1/9/18,5,I had my car serviced and was very impressed with the whole process. The video showing the areas checked during the service was really interesting. From booking on to getting my car back the service was excellent. I wouldn't hesitate recommending or using this service again.
1/8/18,5,"Department were user friendly and demonstrated a very good service.
Ticked the boxes.
Liaison was with Josh"
1/8/18,5,As someone who doesn’t typically like dealing with car salesmen I can say the experience I received at Hunters Derby was excellent. Richard Eyre dealt with all aspects of the sale professionally and his personal service was refreshing.
1/8/18,5,"Excellent service, attentive and professional throughout."
1/8/18,5,"If your choice of car is a Mini, then Cooper Mini Ipswich is your first port of call. Excellent customer services, trustworthy and will go out of their way to help you choose the right car, can't fault them."
1/8/18,5,"Efficient service, short waiting time.
Clear explanation of process and of what might be needed in the future.
Polite staff and clean waiting area"

Thank you for making my visit a pleasure"
1/8/18,5,"Easy to book online, fast and efficient. Sent my Audi Q5 for a service. Price as stated up front."
1/8/18,5,Helpful staff overall good experience would return
1/8/18,5,"Having found minor damage to my car following a repair, I asked Mercedes to investigate. They did not accept liability but offered to look at the damage and offered a courtesy car to use whilewaiting. Within half a day the damage was rectified perfectly.
Throughout, the engineers and support staff were courteous and cooperative.
A perfect result."
1/8/18,5,"Would highly recommend Macclesfield Audi. Sean Graye, the general sales manager provided great service all throughout and couldn’t have done any more for me. Really happy with the service and my purchase. Will be returning in 3 years when buying my next Audi."
1/8/18,4,"Quite a straight forward but expensive trip. Service team are always friendly and helpful, thank you! Also I am definitely interested in getting a new car with VW. Absolutely faultless drive and would recommend to others! (My mum has just got a VW also following on from advice from myself :)"
1/8/18,5,I would recommend them to my friend.
1/8/18,5,Easy booking process using VW App. Professional service from all personnel at Inchcape.
1/8/18,5,Great professional service and I also ended purchasing a new Range Rover as well and was given 5 * treatment
1/8/18,3,Dropped car off for service. There was a problem finding anywhere to park but the staff did help. Car serviced OK and received a call to collect at 1pm. When I went to collect the car still wasnt ready. Waited 30 minutes and enquired how long it would take to bring the car round only to be told the car was just going to be washed. Forty minutes later the car was ready and brought out by the car jocky. No paper work or information on what had been done. I have an MOT due in 2 months so would have liked any advice on tyres etc. Service booking staff was to busy to help.
1/8/18,5,Completed within estimated cost. Car well cleaned. Excellent replacement vehicle for the day. Service manager approachable and happy to answer questions. Decent report.
1/8/18,5,Prompt efficient service - MOT
1/8/18,5,Excellent service and very quick turn around.
1/8/18,5,"Very professional , and great service as always. Thank you."
1/8/18,5,"Good, professional service. Objective explanations, trustworthy and no sales pitch."
1/8/18,5,"Polite, efficient and punctual. Very pleasant service reception area. Good information before, during and after the work. Creates an atmosphere of trust. Was given a 'behind the scenes' tour by an obviously very proud General Manager who clearly had good relationship with all his Staff."
1/8/18,5,"I recently bought a new Mini Cooper from the Colchester dealership and cannot speak more highly of the team there. Everyone was very friendly and made the experience of buying the car hassle free.

I never felt pressurised to buy anything and everyone wanted to ensure I understood everything available.

I particularly wanted to say thanks to Hilary who was my main contact and in an excellent ambassador for the brand."
1/8/18,2,"No updates given during the time the car was in,
Even after calling living messages for an updates still no one called.
even to collect the car no one called, had to peach up hoping its ready.
On arrival was told the car was ready about 30min prior to my arrival but it also took about 30 to 40min to be given the car keys.
This is not the first time dealing with this assistant (Rody De Souza), same thing happening.
and don't want him on my case again. I suspect he has too much workload that he can't handle."
1/8/18,5,Car was booked into Macclesfield Audi service dept to have a couple of things looked at. Courtesy car was provided and our car was looked at promptly by the technician. Audi cam was really useful and pointed out front tyre treads. Our car delivered to home and courtesy car collected. Excellent.
1/8/18,5,Great Service!
1/8/18,1,"Cooper Ipswich disappoint yet again!

Having had less than satisfactory experiences from both the service and sales teams at Cooper Ipswich in the past, I was hoping for a different experience this time but unfortunately it was dreadful from start to finish.

Having initially been advised the service would be £209 when booking it in on the phone, I was told by service reception (a very pleasant chap until he proceeded to chew gum in front of me which I do not feel is either appropriate or professional and in fact rather rude) that the cost would be £488 as there were many other elements to the service that can only be determined from the key rather than the car computer. I reluctantly accepted that (yet again) there would be a bill higher than that originally advised so proceeded to leave my car and spare key - relevance later - at the service centre.

My angst was further enhanced when I collected the car having begrudgingly paid the higher amount when I got home having driven with my main key to find that I had been given the wrong (spare) key by the gum chewer!

I called the dealership number which goes through to a central telephony section who tried unsuccessfully to put me through to Ipswich for 10 minutes before cutting me off. I called back and was told to drive back to the garage with the key (only a 30 minute journey at rush hour!) which I declined and asked that Ipswich call me back. Eventually Cooper Ipswich phoned me back as their error became apparent and thankfully agreed for someone to collect the key from me.

In summary, an unpleasant experience from start to finish and I will look to other BMW garages in future for all my needs."
1/8/18,5,"Absolutely fantastic service from Spencer at hunter Land Rover Kings Lynn, as all other staff that looked after me."
1/8/18,5,"Bought my new BMW from the Norwich dealership.
Great service from first visit all the way through to collection.
Could not be more pleased."
1/8/18,3,"The problem with my car was carried out under warranty and was a repeated problem. The technician diagnosed the fault and replaced the part with no hassle or fuss and took the extra time to explain what may have happened to cause a repeat failure which I thought was a good added touch. My experience fell when it came to dealing with the service advisor. When dropping my car off at the dealership I was trying to explain the issue to the service advisor but she came across as though she had no time for me and wasn't paying any attention to me either. I had a loan vehicle which was a newer model than mine and therefore controls were different and it was also different fuel to my car. At no point was I asked if I was ok with the car and settings I was just handed the keys told to put fuel in it (I wasn't told if it was Petrol or Diesel) and then I was left on my own. I got a voicemail the next day asking what the issue was as they couldn't find any paperwork on the previous issue (which is funny as I told her the night before so clearly wasn't listening) and when I called back again it seemed she couldn't wait to get me off the phone. When I collected the vehicle I wasn't taken through the complimentary health check (which I should have been as my car required tyres), I had my £15 taken and a receipt handed to me and told to wait for my keys. I waited 20mins for my keys only to have them almost chucked at me by the service advisor and told the car was out the front and again I was left to my own devices. The overall experience for me is the technician was great 10/10 but the service advisor really let the experience down 2/10!!!"
1/8/18,5,Committed to customer satisfaction
1/8/18,5,"I made a late call to have the front brakes on my VW up sorted. No problem for inchcape Bolton, they had it in the following day and fixed the issue perfetly. Also gave a check on the car plus a full valet. Now thats what i call great service. Informed friendly staff made the whole experience satisfactory. Top recommendation."
1/8/18,5,"I had an unknown issue with my X4 and Mike in the Service team fitted me into their very busy Friday schedule and resolved the issue quickly and effectively.
Thank you."
1/8/18,5,I was well looked after by Lisa.
1/8/18,5,Highly professional and efficient customer service received. Sam was a pleasure to deal with and very helpful. Many thanks!
1/8/18,5,"As expected, the service was efficient, quick, respectful & they always make sure your dealt with as such. Always a pleasure."
1/8/18,5,"As usual, excellent service fro Mercedes Derby, it's lovely to drive a Mercedes Benz but reassuring to know that the car is looked after by a great tem"
1/8/18,5,Great service and only did the work that was needed!
1/8/18,1,"Had my car in for a break fluid service on Saturday - which I was told would be about an hour, so I chose to wait (started at 9:30) but after two hours and a number of attempts for find someone who could tell me if my car was ready - I was told it would be another 20mins. Communication and overall experience not acceptable. Will not be using again."
1/8/18,5,"My appointment was sorted out for a date sooner than I had anticipated and I chose the drop-of-and-collect option, which was prompt and at the time promised both ways. As it was the car's first service the price quoted was all I anticipated I would have to pay and it proved correct. The health-check was thorough and I definitely felt the difference in the car's performance afterwards."
1/8/18,5,The customer experience was very good.
1/8/18,5,Very pleased with the service five stars rating and good customer service
1/8/18,5,Very polite throughout; friendly; went the extra mile quite literally
1/8/18,5,"Amazing Service start to finish......
We took our car in for a diagnostic check and they completed a free healthcheck too. The video which the technician sent to us with all the information on was brilliant. The additional work was carried out with no hassle and we had the car back in no time. From the front of house communication from Gayle and her team along with Paul and the technicians in the workshop, we couldn't have been in better hands. Big thumbs up and 5 stars :)"
1/8/18,5,"Excellent service, keep me fully up to date throughout the whole process."
1/8/18,5,"Brilliant customer service from Tony and co. The video health check is a great idea and I'd happily say the whole experience is the best I've received for a car service in 17 years of driving.

Highly recommended

Mike"
1/8/18,2,"Cooper BMW, Colchester

My 3 Series Touring went in for routine servicing (at about 45000 miles) at the end of 10/17, and this work was duly completed (but not without the inconvenience of an overnight stay). One of the ""problems"" that I had raised (a yellow ""engine symbol"" on the dash board) was not referred to, and it subsequently emerged, had not been addressed.

During the service, necessary work on the suspension and wheel alignment was identified, and the car was subsequently returned in early 1/18 for this to be done, together with the yellow warning light. (The latter was diagnosed as a faulty ""knock detector"", costing £500 to replace -ouch!).

So, having spent well over £1000 I naively thought I would drive away, and have 12 months of trouble free motoring until the MOT was due. This was not to be, however. The dash board was still indicating ""service required"", and my initial assumption that the mechanic had simply failed to reset the indicator was dashed when I was told that it was necessary for a ""health check"", costing £69 to be carried out. Why on earth this wasn't included as part of the previous two visits wasn't made clear, but basically it meant a third visit to the dealers in a four month period. Not bad for a car that boasts a 24 month servicing cycle!

In fairness to the dealers they have offered me a free MOT in compensation, but the whole episode has left a bad taste in my mouth, to the extent where it has seriously detracted from my view of the dealers, and to a lesser extent, BMW as a brand."
1/7/18,5,"We had an engine problem following recent purchase of a Golf TSI from another garage, which seemed to baffling all. Our own mechanic knew there was a fault, but was unable to identify and recommended a diagnostic test by Inchcape in Exeter. It was comforting to be guided through the process by a highly competent technician who identified the fault, which was soon rectified and reassured on other issue raised.
I highly professional and courteous organisation who we would use again and recommend others to do so."
1/7/18,5,"The team are all great, especially Tim and James - very knowledgeable and offer great advice. Very pleased with my purchase and the aftersales experience. Would not hesitate in recommending and purchasing another car from them."
1/6/18,5,Very pleasant and efficient
1/6/18,5,"Great, friendly and thorough service from the mini team. Thank you"
1/6/18,5,"Audi tetbury was brilliant with me , esp Tom Lawson who was my personal salesman . He was so friendly and helpful and made my experience Fab . My car was delivered yest , at the time planned and the driver give me a bunch of flowers which was such a lovely gesture . Thankyou so much ."
1/6/18,5,We had the total cost of the work involved when the car was left at reception.
1/6/18,5,Excellent prompt service. Good polite staff.
1/6/18,5,"I cannot fault the service I received when I took my car in for some minor works on Thursday. I was looked after by Gabby who was great. Thanks to you all there.

1/5/18,5,My experience with Swindon Audi was outstanding! The professional approach from all their staff was superb. They was very welcoming and delievered exactly what I wanted. They didn’t make me feel uncomfortable or on edge. All I want to say is a massive thank you to Jake who took care of me and I will be recommending Swindon Audi!
1/5/18,5,Excellent customer service and high standard of workmanship .
1/5/18,3,"Very professional service. Only downside is the price of an oil service for a 5 series. Then they found a new fault (which was proven via video sent). When I said I would get that fixed at another garage, surprisingly they started to drop the price they quoted for this. I managed to barter it down further."
1/5/18,5,"Excellent service, friendly professional staff"
1/5/18,5,Excellent service from start to finish.
1/5/18,5,V. Good pre-service information and checking. All v. easy and smooth.

1/5/18,5,"Can’t recommend Kayleigh enough, thoroughly professional and knowledgeable, nothing was too much trouble, even was waiting for me as I arrived at the nearby railway station!

Highly recommend Cooper Banstead and love my new Mini too"
1/5/18,5,Very satisfied
1/5/18,5,"My service call was indeed 10/10. Work carried out as planned, courteous service team, video health check reassuring, car handed back showroom clean and an excellent courtesy vehicle.

Nothing too much trouble. Please convey my thanks to your team.

We are delighted with the Evoque and its unbelievable reliability. In almost 3 years of ownership, apart from the cost of fuel, RFL and insurance, we have only had to replace 2 headlight bulbs and today the front wiper blades … amazing!"
1/5/18,4,"Good reasonably priced service, carried out while I waited, in the advertised time. Car seems fine afterwards and was handed back to me spotlessly clean. The service is scarcely more expensive than an independent and it maintains MB full breakdown cover.
About my only reservations are: that the service was booked for 0815 but the technicians don't start work until 0830, so there was a bit of wasted time at the start; and the free coffee provided was supplied in the now dreaded disposable cups, whereas they used to use china cups."
1/5/18,5,Excellent service and hospitality
1/5/18,5,Excellent service
1/5/18,5,"Well organised, very helpful with no waiting and the service completed successfully within the agreed time."
1/5/18,3,"C-Class Estate
I took it in for correction to malfunction of its auxiliary battery. When they had fixed it the navigation system had been disrupted. I had to wait another 40 minutes for work to the software. Work done under warranty.
This is the second failure in six months."
1/5/18,5,Arrived for a timed appt on time and one hour later drove away. Job done
1/5/18,5,Couldn't fault the experience!
1/5/18,5,Excellent Service
1/5/18,5,Everything was perfect from phone call to remind me of service required to completion of service
1/5/18,1,"Booked a test drive, turned up with no customer parking despite there being only 6 customers in the show room. No receptionist to start with then waited 20 mins for someone to turn up. When Sam did bother to turn up he said one of his other customers had unexpectedly arrived and he was going to see to them not us but would try and find someone else to deal with us. At which point we left only to find some genius had blocked us in which took another 10 mins to sort. For people selling expensive hunks of metal this is abominable customer service."
1/5/18,5,Fast efficient booking and completion / collection of serviced car. Would use again.
1/5/18,5,Excellent service
1/4/18,4,Satisfactory apart from a long wait after booking in before the car was attended to due to volume of work.
1/4/18,5,Perfect - and thank you for the lift into town!
1/4/18,5,"Very pleased with service from coopers Norwich , helpful staff ,nice comfortable seating/waiting area ,lovely coffee !
Dealt with this dealership a few times now and can honestly say I have not been disappointed once with the service we have received. First class !"
1/4/18,5,"Meet and greet.......makes you feel welcome and comfortable
Excellent service by Dean ........keeping me up to date continually whilst my vehicle was getting its winter check up."
1/4/18,5,I recently bought an E Class Plug-in Hybrid saloon from Mercedes-Benz Cheshire Oaks. I found the staff there very helpful and attentive. The process involved a grant from OLEV and so it was not particularly straight forward. John Muldoon kept me informed of progress on the order and I was impressed with his patience and sense of humour. Dale helped with the handover and I was pleased to note that he knew his stuff when showing me over the vehicle. It may be expected that the staff would know about the cars they were selling but his depth of knowledge was particularly impressive. All in all an enjoyable experience!
1/4/18,5,Great service. All staff were very polite and gave me a nice loan car for the day. Thank you so much.
1/4/18,5,"All went well on the day.
The staff were all very helpful and courteous.
Thank you.

1/4/18,5,"BMW Reading

Oliver Webster at BMW Cooper Reading organised the handover of my new BMW X1 in an excellent manner. He was intelligent and knowledgable about the product, happy to take as long as we needed explaining things and very friendly. I would have no qualms in recommending Oliver or BMW Reading."
1/4/18,5,"The issue we had with the car was resolved and the cost covered under warranty. Friendly, polite and professional service. No issues."
1/4/18,5,"I purchased our third Audi as a family and collected a shiny new TT last week, as usual I chose inchape in Maidstone and specifically Andrew Wheeler to handle my sale.

The service and deal were exemplary as per norm, fantastic car, excellent dealership and customer service which sets the bar!

Thanks again Audi, one happy driver!"
1/4/18,5,Superb Customer Service. I am a repeat customer and always appreciate the care and personal attention I get at Cooper Sunderland Mini.
1/4/18,1,"The last couple of times I used VW Chiswick I was hugely disappointed with the service provided. The first time the servicing guys missed out completely a puncture I had in the rear tyre and ended up having a flat tyre. The second time I had the poorest experience where the garage returned my car with 2 damaged centre caps and 1 missing. I chased them incessantly and it took them 4 days for them to 'text' me to come by a convenient time. No apologies, no call, no sorry. Given this experience their prices are really not justified and wished someone took my queries and feedback seriously (if at all). Happy to give more details about the people I dealt with."
1/4/18,5,"Efficient, friendly & honest service"
1/4/18,5,Carried out repair to door lock. Supplied loan car and kept in touch as to when car was ready. Car had been cleaned when returned and cost was less than expected.
1/4/18,5,Excellent Service - I would recommend this garage
1/4/18,5,Efficient and honest service. Easy to book with good summary of work undertaken with explanations and even cleaned my car!
1/4/18,5,Excellent service
1/4/18,5,"I arrived at 10.15am to have my Countryman serviced on TLC and decide to wait ,from the time I handed my key over to the time it was returned I was kept informed of all parts of the service and was able to talk to the technician. The service was very friendly and professional and would recommend to all."
1/4/18,5,"The staff were welcoming, polite, helpful & professional. My vehicle was booked in for a service, I was kept informed throughout the process & when I collected it they'd done a marvellous job of making it look considerably cleaner than it was when I took it in. I felt the price paid was very fair."
1/4/18,5,"Great service, good people to deal with, a very useful video outlining the problem with the car. Making me feel a can trust the company to do what is required honestly."
1/4/18,5,Service team - awesome as always
1/4/18,4,"Very efficient ,with a friendly and warm welcome all things explained and very clear."
1/4/18,1,This firm do not listen to anything you say. Keep sending these emails and I haven't even got a car from them despite contacting them to stop they still send them. Rubbish
1/4/18,4,"Service from front line staff exceptional as always. .. Only negative to let down the experience was on returning to the car to find a half hearted attempt at the vacuum inside! The machine could have ventured into the centre console (would have been nice) and obviously was too afraid to go into the boot space! ...If it did it didn't visit for long!
Disappointing to have to re-do these areas properly when returning home :("
1/4/18,2,Second visit for same fault with pick-up in low revs to be told that Mercedes-Benz produces a system that tells you to change gear but really you should ignore that and change gear when I feel it is the right time. Ah well you plugged it in a computer and it said no fault found so it must be all my fault..
1/4/18,5,Could not have improved on any aspect of my service delivery and drop off excellent communication from your goodselves excellent service to my car excellent I am very pleased with everything

1/4/18,5,"very helpful team, car in for service, check on fan issue & MOT. They called to inform me of what was going on prior to anything being done, video'd and sent link for me to view the checks they made on the car that I asked. Called when work was complete and car ready to pick up, excellent service."
1/4/18,5,Excellent service have recommended to other Mini users.
1/3/18,5,"Erald Kulolli, Sales Executive at Audi Swindon dealer was very helpful in purchasing my new car Audi A3. He found the exact car specifications I required. Furthermore, Erald was very understanding towards my needs and very polite. I highly recommend him as you can trust him with your needs and queries.

I test drove the Audi A1 (metallic blue) the week before, but it wasn't my preferred car nor colour as I wanted black! Within a few days, Erald searched high and low for the new car I wanted, it was an Audi A3, black and very stunning with extras on top - heated seats and parking sensors.

I would highly recommend Erald Kulolli at Audi Swindon dealer. A++++++++"
1/3/18,1,"Took a morning off work to deliver my new BMW for a service at Cooper Thames Ditton. After half an hours wait they told me that whilst I had made an appointment they were too busy to service the car for the next 3 or so hours, maybe longer. I expect much better than this! Will reconsider buyingy next new car from them."
1/3/18,5,"I have had two MOT's done at Lexus Battersea and have been very impressed with the outstanding level of customer service provided by the team.

I would highly recommend any Lexus hybrid car as they are excellent and would also recommend this place for MOT's, servicing and aftercare."
1/3/18,5,A very efficient and courteous service from a reliable dealership. Inchcape has excellent customer service from sales through to servicing. All staff are friendly and knowledgeable and willing to help. A highly recommended dealership others would do well to aspire to.
1/3/18,5,The level of service and and courtesy shown to me was excellent. Well done Heather and your colleagues.
1/3/18,5,"The whole experience was excellent- Jemma the service representative was professional, courteous and friendly throughout."
1/3/18,3,"Experience from Inchcape Exeter was as expected from a high quality dealership - highly courteous staff, was kept informed etc. The disappointment is in that the fault developed in my 4 yr old VW with full service history - a corroded wiring loom in the tailgate caused by an invisible leak of screen wash pipe that serves the rear window - was not covered by a ""comprehensive"" warranty sold by VW UK which i bought to cover the car once >3yrs old but less than £100k miles. i thought it covered everything that was not ""regular"" wear and tear.....but in the small print wiring looms are excluded. Double disappointment - #1 that the car was not sufficiently well manufactured that it developed this hidden leak and #2 that it was not covered by the warranty. Have owned more than 15 cars over the last 30 years and none have ever had any issued with a taligate wiring loom (or any wiring loom for that matter)."
1/3/18,4,My car had winter check done 2/1/2018. Services provided was excellent and the Service Advisor put all your concerns at rest . Great job
1/3/18,2,poor customer parking at the Leicester branch and I only wanted a key ring and it was out of stock! pretty poor to be out of stock of a flipping key ring and sort the parking out wont be using this one I am afraid and my first Mercedes so expected a lot more

1/3/18,5,"First class service from Jodi from start to finish.

Enquired on a used car late evening and had a video of the vehicle before 9am the following morning.
Communicated well throughout, listened to my requirements and accommodated well.
Since collecting the car has stayed in touch re arranging a minor repair.

Thanks Jodi!"
1/3/18,5,I had my Audi A1 in for an upgrade to fit a satnav to the system. The job was carried out while I waited in the showroom. I was also given a complimentary mechanical health check and the car was washed and vacuumed. The whole job was carried out to my entire satisfaction.
1/3/18,2,"The good - we received a courtesy car for the day and the problem with the car was diagnosed within the day.

The bad - It took well over an hour to get booked in. The delay was caused by the operative wanting to see proof of a collision damage waiver as we had rejected the expensive BMW offer at £15. IMO this is simply not necessary, we refused there cover and that should have been the end of it. My partner had our 1 year old daughter with her and this was an unwelcome and difficult delay.

The ugly - Constantly quoting prices ""plus VAT"", just give me what it is going to cost not a maths sum to complete once you finished listing your costs. £144 to diagnose an issue... really!?! Finally my partner and baby were made to wait for a further 30 minutes before our car was ready even though the checks had been complete 1 hr 30 minutes beforehand.

Not the worst experience if i'd gone to a back alley garage but from BMW I expected more."
1/3/18,4,"Routine service, done on time and efficiently. Nice clean car on collection!
Only reservation is the price compared to other national providers."
1/3/18,5,Fitted me in at short notice and went out of their way to accommodate sleeping grandchildren in the car. Much appreciated.
1/3/18,5,As usual everything done exactly as promised. They keep you informed as work progresses and car clean and ready for collection as promised.
1/3/18,5,Adrian was incredibly helpful and the service was exactly as expected - top notch!
1/3/18,5,"They look after you and your vehicle very well...always first class, I must have been in 5 or 6 times so consistent too with different staff.

Easy to book, have had a courtesy car on occasions of major service. for smaller items I have worked remotely using their facilities and wifi."
1/3/18,5,"Although it was just an MOT I felt the service given was excellent. Only thing missing may have been a doughnut or something to go with the coffee, I'm told they are working on that. Met in the lobby and everything explained and that it would take 1-2 hours as the car gets a wash and vacuum before handing it back. I had some other questions for parts department which were noted out for me. All in all no complaints"
1/3/18,5,"Polite, good communication, reasonably priced. Big focus on customer service. Excellent!"
1/3/18,5,Great and quick service. Have been using them for over 2 years for my XF.

1/3/18,5,"My service appointment went as planned with friendly, polite staff. All items were attended to within the timing promised and a last minute request for a lift into town due to bad weather was easily accommodated."
1/3/18,5,"Car Serviced, advised on tire treads, car valeted inside and out - great service"
1/3/18,5,Excellent service
1/2/18,2,"A BMW centre so the service the car receives is good. However, the people working there need to learn some customer service. I booked a deal online which no one recognised and only worked on what they thought I should get from the money I paid. The receptionists did not want to hear my thoughts when I was collecting the car. Later, I filed a complaint and they realised their fault and offered me a premium wash and the work that was missed. They still tried to blame the issue on me for not asking what I booked... what???"
1/2/18,2,"When I rang in to make a booking for my BMW to get its service and MOT( its last service due in the service pack paid for on purchasing the car, I was advised my car didnt need a service as it had only done 23,500. the following day I went to book my MOT only to be told that in fact I needed a service regardless of the mileage on my car. However they were fully booked and the only day they could arrange for this to be carried out was Saturday 23rd December. They also could not confirm what time the garage was going to shut on that particular saturday, as there would be only one salesman at the garage ""so somewhere about 3-4 oclock ""Andy"" may be locking up""... I was not going to be back in Teesside by that time to collect my car so when I asked if it could be done on the wednesday after the Christmas break ie 27th December, I was told in no uncertain terms by BMW Teesside there was no flexibility on the date for the service because my service pack expires on 26th December (the anniversairy day of manufacture not the date of purchase!). I told them that in fact I had not purchased the car and the service pack until the following April 12th and in the four years and a half years of owning the car only had three services on the car at the Teesside garage as ""the vehicle had low mileage"" not the five that I had paid for. I was then told that if my car was not serviced on the 23rd December, I would lose that service. After considering what the value of the service was I phoned the garage service department to book the car in for 23rd December only to be told on giving the registration details once again due to the low mileage, my car did not need a service. This was the fourth conflicting piece of information I had been given by BMW. I decided the following day to go to the Teesside garage on my way back from a meeting nearby, to ask the garage to check the computer key to ensure that in fact my car did not require a service (it was also due its MOT in January 2018). On arrival at the garage the sales man said my car did require a service!!!! a brake service and what I had been told was in fact incorrect!! On trying to explain the situation and the various conflicting bits of information I had been given up to Thursday 21st December, by various BMW departments, the salesman became quite nonchelant and said he would check with his administration manager. He wasnt interested he said in what I had been told the fact was it needs a service and it could only be done on 23rd December or not at all under the service pack. He returned moments later saying they would not extend the date for my service to be done on the Wednesday 27th december as my car was five years old on 26th December,(the garage was close on 26th December) the date was not flexible in any way once the car was five years old!! despite the fact I had paid for the service pack four and a half years earlier!! he restated it did indeed need a service which would be lost if I didnt bring it in on the saturday. He continued by saying I must have seen my service light on my car and should have booked the car in earlier rather than leaving it till 19th December to call in and what did I expect him to do about it moving forward. The sales persons attitude was that he wasnt interested,,,,,, that was it take it or leave it. I had honestly intended to buy (as I had for the previous 10 years) another new BMW and I told him this. he was flipant in his response and because of his attitude and the way in which the whole matter had been dealt with from the outset for a straight forward service I told the salesman that I would get the car in for 8.30-9a.m on saturday 23rd December I only wanted the service doing and not the MOT and they would need to keep my car safely until wednesday 27th December as I was unable to collect on 23rd December before they closed (whatever time they decided to close their garage!!) I also added I would not be returning to the garage again for anything to do with my car or even to consider buying another BMW because of the attitude of this particular sales person and the manner in which the whole booking of the service was dealt with by the garage. If i had decided to accept what the service department told me that I did not require a service and not taken my car in on that saturday 23rd December I would have lost out on another service!!! I have purchased minis and BMWs and spent a considerable amount of money at that garage but I am certainly going elsewhere in the future. Very disappointed as I love my BMW, my family have purchased cars from this garage but certainly will not in the future..."
1/2/18,5,Very helpful and speedy service .
1/2/18,5,for a very long time have always wanted a merc which i now have and along with the car your service centre is one of the best Thankyou
1/2/18,3,"Timelines not managed well, everything else broadly as expected certainly nothing above and beyond."
1/2/18,4,"We were messed about with appointment time, so had to call someone to pick me up. Live 35 minutes away so BIG problem had to arrange return trip as well. Car was ready 4 hours later clean as promised so no issues with the actual service."
1/2/18,5,"Great service as always guys, keep up the good work!"
1/2/18,4,I had to wait little longer than I hoped but they were very busy. The car came back the repair complete(under warranty) and cleaned in side and out. Overall very happy and will use again when needed.
1/2/18,4,As always very prompt service; recall was carried out efficiently.
1/2/18,3,Okay experience. Was only buying a Jaguar travel mug which although a bit longer than expected was concluded with our any mishaps. Only complaint is that it doesn't fit in the Jaguar holder despite it being a Jaguar travel mug but sits okay in the Honda. Bit bizarre but hey ho.
1/2/18,5,"My experience was one of a helpful, courteous team dedicated to the product"
1/2/18,5,"Coopers Mini at West Boldon have an extraordinarily good staff.The reception and sales staff are a credit to the company.They are friendly, helpful,and show knowledge of the product they are selling.This includes Ayesha,Graham,Chris ,Grace and Charlotte."
1/2/18,5,"Very impressed with the whole new-car buying process from Neil at Audi Crawley, from the first discussion of our needs, to final trade-in and new-car hand over. Thank You."
1/2/18,5,I got my BMW 640d serviced from the dealership and was happy with service.
1/2/18,2,Very disappointing visit. Explained we had a warning light on dashboard. Person on service desk said they would look at it. At no time did she tell us a diagnostic test would cost approx £100. Feel very strongly that this cost should have been mentioned up front before I handed over my keys. Customer service needs a massive improvement
1/2/18,5,"I recently brought a Mini from Cooper Chelmsford. The customer service was exceptional, I have recommended them to my friend. I love my new car which Martin went and picked up for me from Kent. I was very impressed with my experience."
1/2/18,3,"Having purchased a VW with the so called emissions ""cheat"" I was somewhat entering an area of disappointment, which I have never had before with VW. Although the attention from Inchscape made some recompense to a very poor resolution from VW. In general the solution has provided me with a VW Golf with way below the manufacturers economy (Bluemotion vehicle 1.6 deisel.). Now in the region of 27 to 32mpg urban and if you drive like an angle with the lightest of touch you could possibly increase this by around 3 to 4 extra mpg. So I would advise purchasing a vehicle from a German manufacturer. My next car will take much longer to consider, and probably be a none European manufacturer. Honda are looking favored at the moment."
1/2/18,4,"Really good service when I arrive I was looked after very well, the reason I was there was fro a recall from Mercedes, it took a little longer than I thought, that said I was impressed with the way I was attended to."
1/2/18,5,Great friendly service. No issues.
1/2/18,5,"One of the best places I have experienced when buying a car. Absolutely no pressure and very laid back. Ross was brilliant in the sale of my car, 100% recommend."
1/2/18,4,"After some confusion about whether my car needed Service A or Service B, the job was carried out efficiently and on time. The staff is obviously competent and one is assured of a high level of service. The only glitch was that they cleaned and vacuumed the entire car but, as I discovered on bringing the car back home, they forgot to do the boot!"
1/2/18,5,"Serviced the car in good time, looked after me while I waited. Coffee was good too."
1/2/18,3,"Over all experience good.
I visited Cooper Mini Reading in December for a winter health check though ended up have a routine service done. I stayed at the dealership whilst it as done. it took a few minutes but was eventually offered a drink by a member of the sales team. When my car was done I was approached and given the paper work for the service though did not leave feeling 100% satisfied. On top of this when I got home and looked at the service book I found it had not been filled in or stamped. The member of the service team was friendly and helpful though I felt a bit unsure about everything and left questioning things. Maybe was an 'off' day though would not say I left feeling confident."
1/2/18,5,Once again Matthew Whittaker very kindly booked by car in and took it in to have a service and MOT. Very efficient and professional so very pleased with the overall experience.
1/2/18,4,Prompt service but I did ask to have brake fluid topped up and this was not done
1/2/18,5,"Very good support from initial call to purchase procedure. Thank you to Levi and his managers. A world away from previous terrible/non-existant customer service from Land Rover, Audi, and Approved Used Mercedes of Birmingham."
1/2/18,2,"YA17 VZA

The vehicle was checked and signed off for me ready to take, I drove 50 feet down the road and notice the display screens on the rev counter wasn’t working. I drove back to the garage, hadn’t it been for the “BMWgenius” Phil then my experience would have been even worse. Never the less they had to take my car back into the garage to plug it up to a machine, this took hours and we ended up not leaving till 3pm. With a 5 hour drive in fromt of us I can tell you I wasn’t in the best of moods.
Arrived at the garage at 9:45am.
The worse part was the salesman (Andy) was never seen again, he didn’t come and apologise or even offer me and my wife a drink. That was very shocking to us.

Kevin Ratcliffe"
1/2/18,3,"Car was serviced without an issue, however I was left waiting for 20 mins before I spoke to someone when I came to collect my car, and the car had not been valeted (probably because I cleaned the car myself the day before)"
1/1/18,5,"Very serene atmosphere. Staff are very caring, accommodating and good service for the vehicles. Overall very pleasant experience"
1/1/18,2,"Forgot to do the MOT, so i need to return the car once again. Was not informed of any of the servicing costs before work was done. Left hanging around at an unmanned reception. And the valet was done in a hurry. Not worth the dealer-premium that is paid for this routine work so will go something else next year."
1/1/18,5,"Great customer service, quality cars, enjoyable buying experience"
1/1/18,1,"Showroom & Waiting area was unheated so waiting for one and half hours for a set of tyres to be swapped in December with snow falling was unacceptable. When tyres removed from rear of car, and then replaced back in there was wet tyres and dirty tyres placed against the interior and not on the protective mat prior inserted. If I wanted the car to be cleaned (exterior) I'd have to wait between 3/4 to an hour. Not in a freezing waiting area. All staff were wearing coats and scarfs too."
1/1/18,5,"Brilliant response to an irritating problem with tyres and faulty air pressure pumps at petrol stations! As I had an important journey, given a ""fast track"" appointment for tyre check up; kept informed and car returned within agreed time in immaculate condition.
Many thanks to CooperBMW Reading Service Team"
1/1/18,3,"My car has been fixed and I am pleased. George, the service manager, was extremely helpful in getting the fault identified when I brought my car in and then gave me a 'loan car' over Christmas. The price was high (to me!) but probably the going rate - I didn't check and wouldn't want to go anywhere else. Cooper have looked after my car from new and I trust them to do a good job. I like the video they give to explain the work they do.
The only issue which marred the experience was my poor treatment when I first called in for advice and help - Emma (I think that is correct) was unhelpful, ignoring my call initially and when I called back I had to almost beg to have the car looked at. I was treated with disdain and I didn't like it. Thank goodness for George - he is brilliant."
1/1/18,4,Excellent service
1/1/18,4,"I have given only 4 stars as when I had got home roughly 45mikes, the the pressure on the left back wheel needed some air, also the diesel emission stated there was only 1500miles left! There is also a clip needed for the front bumper"
1/1/18,5,Very easy and professional experience
1/1/18,5,"Excellent sales man Rappal Vadhwana at Maidstone. Could not do enough for me really put himself out,,
Would defiantly recommend him when purchasing a car,, Always offered a tea or coffee too"
1/1/18,5,"A no-rush, honest discussion about car purchase with friendly. professional staff who, while obviously wanting a sale, conduct the discussion with customer satisfaction as the prime driving force."
1/1/18,5,"I know what people say about car showrooms, the best place to buy a car from ! But honestly I have never been to a show room where all the staff are so polite and nothing is to much trouble. It was pleasure to buy my car from them, full credit to sales staff true professional and thank you all. Will fully recommend you."
1/1/18,5,"Great help from Hunter’s Land Rover - Norwich

Would recommend VERY a highly."
1/1/18,5,"I have purchased a number of cars in my time including Audi , BMW and Mercedes.
The service and attention to detail I experienced at Jaguar has surpassed them all.
This is the car to buy."
1/1/18,5,Emma was fantastic gave my mother and myself full attention at all times... Thanks... Just love my New Mini Thanks :-)... Mark
1/1/18,3,The specification of the car we purchased was not what we were told we would be getting. I noticed this when I got the car home and when I called to mention this was told that all I could do was bring the car back. This would have caused a lot of problems so we stuck with what we had. Also the car was not ready on the day agreed and we had to wait another week which also caused problems. And lastly the mileage was significantly higher than what we were told.
1/1/18,5,"Each time I've bought a car with Macclesfield Audi, I've been treated with respect, kindness and like a valued customer."
1/1/18,5,"Excellent main dealer service, Living up to the promise ""Think BMW Service expensive Think Again"" & Price Match Local non dealer service providers.
BMW Cooper Teesside provided a price that no one could match!
I will be making Cooper Teesside my first choice for all repairs and servicing needs.
Thanks Again to all you're Team all first class, from entering to leaving Coopers dealership."
1/1/18,5,"Excellent service, very friendly and professional"
1/1/18,5,Amazing service as always. This is my 5th Audi from these guys.
1/1/18,3,"Everything was fine regarding the service and the delivery and collection, but having to wait 3 weeks for a service does not compare well with other local dealers we use."
1/1/18,5,"Always met with friendly faces. My car went in for its MOT, I was informed of the process and given accurate timings. Shortly after leaving I received the informative video from the garage. Extremely helpful and quick process."
1/1/18,4,Audi Crawley explained iñ great detail how leasing worked very informative about the product would not hesitate to recommend
1/1/18,5,"I would recommend Becky at all times
Very friendly no pressure with lots of help and advice"
1/1/18,5,"Very good Mercedes dealer nothing is to much trouble,service or warranty problems from the booking in to a courtesy car no problem.
Staff are all very friendly and courteous 10/10."
1/1/18,5,Called in with little notice and the team were very accommodating . Nothing was too much trouble and they had me on my way quickly and efficiently. Thanks
1/1/18,5,I found the service excellent. The people I dealt with were friendly and very helpful. I had had trouble adjusting my wing mirrors and even this was sorted for me! The car was returned having had a good clean.
1/1/18,5,"Excellent service - did what they said, no surprises, kept me informed, polite and friendly."
12/31/17,3,Wasn’t over impressed at all.
12/31/17,5,All staff i spoke to were very friendly and Kezandra explained the process very clearly and professionally as this was the first vehicle service and visit to Inchcape at Swindon. David Moore in your Parts Department recommended Inchcape and we are very pleased with the work carried out on our vehicle.
12/31/17,5,"From the initial booking in, collecting a loan car, service and notification that the car was ready I can only give enormous praise. The Service Receptionist at Cooper Teesside (Amy Smith) was very efficient, caring and knowledgeable."
12/30/17,5,"Booked car in to have a new passenger seat cover fitted as old one was starting to crack.
Worked carried out in the agreed time frame keeping me informed of progress as agreed.
Picked car up having been washed and cleaned looking like new.
Would recommend"
12/30/17,5,"I have been a Jaguar and later an Audi driver for many years with this being my first VW.
Initially I was concerned about build quality and customer service as both have been excellent in the past.
Well, what can I say.... VW customer service is fantastic and every bit as good as Jaguar and Audi. My heated steering wheel was a little temperamental so made a call... it was booked in for analysis, fully valated, full health check and a new steering wheel ordered and replaced with no hassel at all.
All the staff at VW Chester are fantastic and I cannot fault a single part of their service.
Pretty happy with the Touareg as well, its really growing on me."
12/30/17,5,Everyone really helpful in the purchase of a great car. Great handover process.
12/30/17,4,"Three weeks ago I went to Jaguar in Guildford and took an XE out for a test drive. Carl Port knew his stuff and was able to give me a really clear understanding of what the car had to offer. I’m unable to take calls at work so asked Carl not to call me during office hours. He respected this and either emailed or called after work. Managed to source a car meeting all of my requirements from Preston. Picked it up last week and after an initial problem with the coolant fluid have had a good weeks driving. I’d like to thank Carl for his relaxed, non pushy sales approach. On the whole a positive experience... and even when things went wrong they were put right!"
12/30/17,5,The place to be.
12/30/17,5,"First class service again.
Made to feel welcome from the minute I walked into the Inchape Garage/Showroom. Staff were courteous and polite.
Kept up to date with what was being done to my vehicle regarding the Service and MOT.
All in all very happy with the service provided."
12/30/17,5,Excellent service all round as always!
12/30/17,4,"This is the third time I’ve used cooper bmw reading for a service. Everything was good apart from the wash they gave the car. It seems the valeting guys may have over indulged on there Christmas turkey as the the bottom of the doors , side skirts and arches were still dirty. You could see where the sponge or wash mit had smeared slightly into these areas. The rest of the car was cleaned properly. Offered a free full valet next time the car is in for service but that won’t be for 19000 miles."
12/30/17,5,Great experience with Maidstone Audi. Michael Taylor was really brilliant and made me feel at ease with the whole process. Thank you!
12/30/17,2,"Score given as from the outset the transaction had a number of 'challenges'.

Firstly as someone living many miles away from Croydon, the dealership failed to provide any real customer service from first enquiry when the phone just rang out, to the weekend reception staff appearing not to give a damm to the apparently sole sales person being to busy to write my details down instead asking me to email him.

Secondly the P/X value for my car was just greed on the part of BMW Cooper Croydon and only after lots of too and froing a better price was agreed. However the Sales Manager could not even be bothered to speak with me on the phone instead passing messages via reception staff.

Thirdly when visiting the site prior to collect, again the reception staff really could not give a damm and instead of trying to accommodate me by finding someone to show me the vehicle I was buying, they thought it acceptable to ask me to wait for an indefinite period whilst again the apparent sole used car sales person was busy. Whilst waiting numerous sales people were seen and on approaching one, he was able to help so not sure why the reception staff could not have done this?

Finally, on collecting my car the handover/instruction was wanting and on getting it home, I noticed numerous scratches to the bodywork with badges missing and also glue on the paintwork. Granted the dealership agreed to pay another Cooper dealership closer to me to complete the repairs, but this was not done right and is another story.

My impression of this dealership and in some ways Cooper BMW, is that turnover volume is more important than customer care and the customer experience. Cooper is part of Inchcape Group and I have never had an issue with their VW dealerships - perhaps BMW ones think they are better."
12/30/17,5,Bought a new RR Velar from Hunters [Guildford]. Mark Parsons made the whole process simple and most of all very enjoyable. Great service by all from the moment we walked through the door. Nice showroom delivers the brand perfectly.
12/29/17,5,"The quality of service I received from H.A Fox Jaguar in Norwich was supremely high. Booking my Jaguar XF in for an all round brake disk & pads renewal was ease itself. My every requirement was discussed and recorded in great detail by the knowledgeable Telephone Service Advisor. The work carried out by the Service Engineer was absolutely faultless and the foyer care I received whilst waiting for the work on my XF to be finished was better than some 5 star hotels I have stayed in! The Service Manager who guided me through the entire process was more than helpful throughout and an absolute delight to do business with. I was then sent a video showing the work which the Engineer had completed on my XF and views of the underside of my vehicle which I would never have seen otherwise. My XF was valeted inside and out before I collected it. It now brakes as smoothly, silently and evenly as those hyper-luxury vehicles costing £50,000 more. Thank you H.A. Fox!"
12/29/17,5,Excellent service from start to finish. Great team.
12/29/17,5,"Car was picked up at the time agreed. Driver was friendly.
dealership kept me updated on progress. Car was returned clean."
12/29/17,5,"Recent purchase is used Mini ... good price, low pressure sale and comprehensive test drive"
12/29/17,5,First time at VW inchcape and its been a very good experience. Staff is very helping and good standard of work.
12/29/17,1,"Went into the Southport showroom today to enquire about a used car and to arrange a test drive. Was ignored by 3 sales staff (2 of which had no customers, one of which had a customer for part of the time) for 10-15 mins as I stood in the middle of the showroom. Eventually I asked the chap cleaning a car beside me to confirm that I wasn't invisible, which he did. I then left. No-one bothered to speak to me at any stage.

Please don't respond and say 'reach out to us'.."
12/29/17,5,"Although they were busy, very efficient and completed task within timescale. Friendly staff and waiting area, with hot drinks available and play area for children, also TV to watch."
12/29/17,5,I was impress with level of customer service. Well done.
12/29/17,5,Any discerning customer will undoubtedly recognise that the team at Southport always provide a truly professional and reliable service. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone in the market for a top performing vehicle at competitive prices.
12/29/17,4,Great customer service at inchcape Manchester went in with a problem with the car but got it sorted out without any problems at all keep up the great service 10 out of 10
12/29/17,5,Fantastic service- super quick and efficient. Also the best clean my car has ever had! Came back showroom shiny! Thank you.
12/29/17,3,"Booked in as a brake pad warning light coming on. Ended up paying for 2 brake discs and pads all round. Very nearly £600. Took 3 hrs to complete.
It wasn’t thought I’d have to replace the discs as car has only done 30,000 miles."
12/29/17,3,"Took my wife's TT in for a major service. Agreed a price on the phone when I booked it in, 350 for an oil, filter, spark plugs. Not exactly bargain basement. When we went in to pick the car up they had not fitted any plugs to a 45k/4 year old car that isn't then due another service for 18k putting it past their book estimate of 57k for plugs. They did get the car back in and fitted the plugs when this was pointed out. What really grinds is that they would have let my wife leave without them to come back long after they were past due. They claimed that there had been some 'confusion', however this was entirely their mistake and they were clearly not following manufacturers servicing guidelines. The car was unevenly wearing its tyres and the only remedial action they were offering was a set of tyres. We had all 4 tyres replaced with Pirellis at Quickfit and had a hunter 4 wheel alignment for 100 pound less than Audi wanted for 4 inferior Bridgestone tyres. It's not a bad service centre it's just distinctly average and you will need to check what you agree on the phone is what they provide on the day."
12/29/17,3,Level of service excellent - have had to mark this down however as somebody in the dealership did not agree with my choice of radio station and had reprogrammed it for their own entertainment. I don’t expect to start having to alter the media settings on my own car - maybe Inchcape could invest in a portable radio for said employee so they don’t have to use the customers car as a juke box in future.
12/29/17,5,Good customer service
12/29/17,5,"Adrian was very helpful - even after his manager failed to reserve the first car for me, so I lost it!"
12/29/17,3,"The service was fine but I asked for the windscreen wipers to be changed and I ended up being charged over £50 inc VAT. This is an extortionate price to charge for a set of windscreen wipers, that is unless they are gold plated."
12/29/17,2,"28/12/17 - so time of year maybe a reason - though no excuse in my mind.
Absolutely hopeless on the telephone.
Took ages to get an answer, then put on hold over 5 minutes to talk to service - gave up when no answer.
Tried again - exactly the same result.
Eventually got through on the 3rd attempt.
Text to say 'car ready for collection', went to the showroom, reception tells me 'someone will be with you in a minute', no-one bothered to tell me the person I wanted to speak to was on the phone, so sat there like a lemon, no information, for at 5 minutes or more before she became free.
No issues with the person herself - very efficient and helpful, but the whole place let down by lack of communication. Doubt I'll be back."
12/29/17,5,Excellent service from service department . My first time at the swindon Audi. I will highly recommend Audi service department ...
12/29/17,5,Excellent service
12/29/17,5,Good service and a quick delivery
12/29/17,1,"This was my first experience at Mercedes Benz Derby. I felt the person from the service team that I had been allocated, clearly lacked customer service skills and I was appaled by his behaviour when challenged. The coffee machine had broken down and there was no offer of a hot drink being made, despite staff having drinks, whilst I waited for my car service. The only positive point was the car was valeted to a good standard."
12/29/17,5,Very pleased with the service from all the staff at H.A.FOX NORWICH
12/29/17,5,"Good, quick service, on time, clear report. Excellent."
12/29/17,5,"I waited on site - tea and coffee on tap. I used the wifi, so i could carry on working.
Total time 1. hours, including a car wash."
12/29/17,5,Always very good service
12/29/17,5,"The service was excellent - despite poor weather, and struggling to locate our property, the response was cheerful, communication good, and MOT completed, with good feedback, both on paper, over the phone, and in a video clip showing the recommended work. Excellent."
12/29/17,5,Very prompt and efficient service under two hours
12/29/17,5,Excellent treatment by H A Fox in servicing my vehicle. Sent me a video of the health check very quickly. Very painless and would use them again
12/29/17,4,"Upon arrival greeted with a friendly receptionist and only waited for a couple of minutes to see someone from the service dept. It was my car’s first service and pointed out a couple of things - concerns. At the end of the service nothing mentioned about my queries. When I arrive at home noted 2 tyre air caps were missing.
Just to clarify I bought the car from WARRINGTON AUDI and I would never go back there or Jardine motors, despite of living 4 miles away from Liverpool Audi I chose to come to Cheshire oaks AUDI.
This is why other companies failing, they don’t treat their customers genuinely and full of lip service as well as corporate talk.
This is why I gave you one less star but I still come to Cheshire oaks and I still recommend you to my friends and colleagues.

12/28/17,5,"We really enjoyed buying a vehicle from Hunters Southampton. Rob who looked after our purchase was patient, very helpful and excellent at processing the paperwork. He took time to explain everything to us and made the purchase an enjoyable and very satisfactory experience.

We would certainly buy another vehicle from Hunters when we are looking again. Thank you so much."

12/28/17,5,"Friendly and attentive service. None of the staff gave the impression they would rather not have been in work on 27th December. Great bonus that we had no quibble at all in asking for repair work to be covered under warranty, that came to £360"

12/28/17,5,"I can only review Mercedes Loughborough:

Bryan Chambers and Matt his direct manager make the whole process of selling/buying nearly a pleasure. If these two were not a Inchcape UK Loughborough, then there would be no deal.
However all others involved in the deal are professional to the last."
12/28/17,5,Very efficient and polite staff. High quality service received....
12/27/17,5,"Stopped by BMW Inchcape Norwich today for a Winter Check Up on my recently purchased used BMW. The service was impeccable all,the way from the staff at check in to the amazing attention to detail with no charge. My car came back sparkling clean both inside and out with a clean bill of health. That’s what I call customer care and service. I will be sure to follow up any necessary annual checks again with Inchcape."
12/27/17,5,I always enjoy my visits to vw Bolton all the staff are friendly and very helpful.there product knowledge is very good and nothing is to much trouble.There service department is also very helpful in fulfilling my service and maintenance needs.I would be only to willing to recommend VW bolton
12/27/17,1,"I first contacted Hunters Land Rover on the 17th December 2017. I was enquiring about a Range Rover Evoque which they had for sale. I spoke with a guy called Cam and he then put me through to a guy called Sean. I was trying to understand the logic behind the fixed price strategy. Sean explained that Head office do the pricing and they have no control and there is no room for movement around the price and I either take a risk and see if the price came down or buy it at that price. I found his attitude and lack of empathy or interest in me, frankly annoying but at the same time, I did like the car. I explained to Sean that I didn't like the black alloys which the car had and he said that was fine. They would be changed back to the silver ones (as per the advertisement) I was travelling from Derbyshire to Southampton so I was pleased that this had been confirmed. I advised Sean that I would want to collect on the 27th due to work commitments. He said that would be fine. I called back and spoke to Cam on the 20th and asked a few questions about the car. He said he would email me the answers that day. I called three further times before I got the email. I confirmed to Cam that I would travel over on the 23rd to view the car. I got to the showroom to be greeted by Cam who introduced me to Jason. Jason was very informative and helpful. Pointing out the cars features. I told Jason that I was disappointed to see that the front drivers side wheel trim wasn't fixed correctly and the car had polish everywhere which made it look cheap. Jason completing agreed and assured me that if I brought the car. The trim would be fixed. I then went to sit with Cam to discuss a purchase. I explained about the alloys being changed for me to collect on the 27th and Cam said they had been sprayed not changed and that he would have to get them resprayed and he couldn't tell me when that would be done. My friend was with me and stated that we wouldn't be able to travel down after the 27th so they would have to deliver. Again Cam said he would have to see but would aim to delivery and it be the 30th. I decided to make a refundable deposit and wait for a call today 27th to confirm delivery on the 30th. Cam tuck 45 minutes to take a £1000 deposit from me, during which time we were just sat waiting. He promised me he would call me today 27th (morning) and advise if the car alloys could be resprayed and delivery could be the 30th. It is now 12.04 I haven't received any calls. I have called and Cam is off today and always would have been. The receptionist is new and doesn't know who can help me. I have given her Sean and Jasons name.... Still sat waiting.
I have brought cars from many garages and never been treated as if I am an inconvenience. I am in customer experience myself and feel I need to highlight to someone that I have been treated this way and still am. I would really appreciate some help and assistance as I feel I am spending thousands potentially and these people are not committed to helping me and I have very little faith of agreeing this purchase."
12/27/17,5,Vehicle taken in as there was a smell of exhaust fumes in the car. Pick appointment offered and technician came to car with me to make sure they understood issue. Quickly diagnosed and resolved - and recall work done at the same time . Excellent service with a smile
12/27/17,3,"I couldn’t go for 5* rating because the car was picked up later than scheduled, I had to take time off to be at home, and returned lot later than time promised, so couldn’t keep an appointment..!
The work I believe is satisfactory though no servicing, I thought was due, was carried out...!!"
12/27/17,5,"From the initial booking experience through to the greeting, care and attention on arrival and during my while you wait service everything was first class. I was kept fully informed and received a video vehicle check which was a nice touch just before my car was ready"
12/27/17,2,"The labour element of the Long life service is very expensive for what it is...oil & filter, fuel filter and pollen filter. So called technicians just have to plug a laptop in to update the car, MMI still doesn’t have the new Mersey bridge on the map?!!!
Complimentary wash and vac...my 7 year old could of done a better job!"
12/26/17,5,Fantastic service and super quick on the turn around of my new vehicle! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a new BMW!
12/26/17,5,"Buying my first Mini from Cooper Norwich was a simple process,
Lee made the experience a pleasure nothing was to much trouble for him.
Each model was explained to me along with test drives this made it easy for me to make correct choice.
I’ve now taken delivery of my Ice blue Mini Cooper S I’m absolutely delighted with it"
12/26/17,4,good welcome at reception with comfortable area to sit and relax kept advised throughout service
12/26/17,4,"Good professional service and particularly after sale agreed. Very pleasant people to deal with. Pre sale company is very focused on bottom line, which is to be expected but a little too evident in the desire to up sell after very clear expectations had been given on maximum budget. Overall very happy with service to date."
12/26/17,5,Great service from a Danny Rhodes and his support team - will happily recommend to others
12/26/17,5,A very pleasurable experience guided by a knowledgeable professional staff.
12/26/17,5,Kept informed efficiently and would certainly recommend.
12/26/17,2,"1- When I arrived in the morning, it took the receptioist about 15 minutes to find the booking for my car.
2- I was not issued with any documentation that I have left my car at the garage.
3- When I asked for colection time... they cut a piece of paper and wrote their telephone number on it, handed the paper to me to call them later in the to enquire about the status of repair.
4- I phoned twice in the afternoon, once they said they have not finished the job yet, and the second time they didnt know anything about the car and said we will call you back to update you.
5- I never eceived any phone call but by chance saw a message on my phone that the car has been fixed and ready for collection. This text was sent to me well before my second call.
6- Due to this avoidable delay I had difficulties to find lift to the garage as i did not hae courtsey car and also hit heavy traffic."
12/26/17,4,"Very pleasant and efficient
Car could have been cleaner on the inside but besides that very satisfied

Clive Allerston"
12/26/17,5,"the car terrific as is the service
only problem is the time it took"
12/26/17,5,"Experience was very good. Although I wasn’t on the list when I arrived, I was booked in and a hire car was available for the day. Graham looked after me and called me very early to say the car was ready. The video was very helpful. I was quoted a price in advance for the service of £308 but this ended up being £337 as Cooper S pads were larger. They should have known this in advance. I also thought this covered all brakes but only related the front so a bit misleading and more expensive. Otherwise car was ready when I needed it and cleaned when I picked up."
12/26/17,5,"I took my Golf in for a winter check on Friday 22nd December. From the moment I arrived I was treated with courtesy and helpfulness. The job was done efficiently and thoroughly. I can't praise Inchcape Volkswagen Altrincham highly enough.
Thank you Everyone.

12/25/17,4,"Service management was good, complementary car wash not very good."
12/25/17,3,"I can't fault the service I received on Saturday from both the service personnel & the salesperson I dealt with both before & after my decision to buy my Fpace from your company but I am not happy with the ""------"" decision to put him solely into the sale of 2nd hand cars so if I choose to purchase a 3rd Jaguar from new & he is still with your company it WILL be with his assistance or not at all & I can't be the only customer with this view."
12/25/17,5,"Honest, straightforward and very professional. It was a pleasure buying my defender through them. Special thanks to Martin."
12/25/17,5,"Great Service, thoroughly professional and cheaper than the local independent. I will definitely use again."
12/25/17,5,I needed an urgent booking at the service dept. I called in the afternoon and was offered a slot first thing the next day. When I arrived the next day I was dealt with in a courteous and efficient way. The job was undertaken and completed very quickly and I was kept informed throughout the process. The bill was significantly lower than I expected and included a courtesy car wash and vacuum. I'm very pleased with the service and wouldn't hesitate to return.
12/25/17,5,"Needed a car quickly, picked up the perfect model within 5 days of setting foot in the dealership. Can’t ask for better than that!"

12/25/17,5,"I have often purchased parts from Coopers in Norwich and also had work carried out. On my car. The car is not new (BMW E46 M3) yet this does not effect the service I receive. Every time I have visited I have been made to feel welcome and the staff are incredibly friendly and professional. I am never bugged or hassled. Cannot recommend enough. I found the service manager (Thomas) was particularly helpful. 5stars from me
😎😎👊👊👌👌"
12/25/17,5,"I went in for free airbag replacement and not only was the car washed as well, a free visual check revealed a few advisory items.

12/24/17,5,"I'm very pleased with my recent service from Inchcape Colchester. It was very easy to organise and staff kept in contact with me via text and email for reminders. I particularly like the video link showing the underneath of my Polo! I appreciated the service report which pointed out 'amber' items that would need seeing to in a few months' time. Advice, explanations and service from Ian O'Sullivan was excellent at all stages - especially removing some exterior scuffing. The car was also valeted to a high standard. Thank you very much!"

12/22/17,4,"The service was courteous and efficient including a prompt response to my request to replace the cabin filter at the last moment when I discovered that it was not included in the service that I had chosen. Good communication and good customer focus, I would definitely consider returning in future."
12/22/17,5,"Booked in for a replacement bumper after a small car park collision. Prompt and professional service as usual from MB North Wales. Reception, service and sales staff always a pleasure to deal with."
12/22/17,5,Always great service.
12/22/17,2,"Issue with my car. Handbreak not working warning light keeps coming on. Booked in car for checks. Found issue as software need updating. Picked up my car and only got 200 yards and the warning ⚠️ came back on.
No first time fix now booked in for next available appointment. Just wasting my time.
Hope this issue can be fixed."
12/22/17,5,I like how inchape treat you. They keep you updated . No pressure. Also very friendly. I am a trustworthy person and I appreciate that they do too.

12/22/17,4,"It has and is always a good experience talking and dealing with the people at BMW, that have a truly great understanding of customer services, and what makes a customer happy. The recent car service was no exception, takes the stress out of the day, and the car is always returned cleaned and ready to go.

Martin"
12/22/17,5,"Can't fault the Service Desk Team.
Always polite, courteous and helpful."
12/22/17,5,Excellent service once again
12/22/17,4,"We were really pleased with the service and MOT, however we were disappointed that we were told the car would be cleaned before being returned to us. This is obviously just an added extra. But I firmly believe if you say you're going to do something it should be done to the same top standard of any other service you provide. The car was cleaned but badly done. The inside of the car wasn't up to a standard which I believe Mini would like their reputation held to.
We were very disappointed.
Plus after speaking to my sister in law she has also experienced the same thing from you. So I do think this is an area which needs looking into."
12/22/17,5,"Polite and friendly service team at Maidstone Audi, especially Ben who ha fled things for me this visit......no problems from booking to service to collection, would happily recommend the team"
12/22/17,5,"I have bought a number of cars from this dealership over the last few years....and there's a very good reason for that; always excellent service, never pushy, willing to do a good deal, and more importantly look after you as a customer. I have no hesitation in recommending Jordan, Chris and Carl to anyone wanting to buy a mini..."
12/22/17,5,"The quality of the staff at Cooper Durham is outstanding. The service staff in particular are so helpful, understanding and courteous without losing any of the professionalism you expect from a company of this size. Well done and thank you."

12/22/17,5,"Excellent attention received from the time of booking to arrival at Stratford. The ladies on reception were smiling and welcoming and Sophie who looked after me was very pleasant, knowledgeable and courteous. She took the time to engage with me and listened to my requests in terms of small issues that I wanted checking over and in collection took time to talk through the work completed and what was required for the two issues that I had discussed. No rushing despite my appointment being 2 days before the Christmas weekend. My courtesy car was wonderful, shame I could only keep it for the day. Mercedes Benz Stratford will be my first choice for the future."
12/22/17,5,Excellent customer service from start to finish. Dealt with both Tom Jury and Tommy Farthing who are both a credit to the company. Always kept me informed of progress throughout the process with professionalism and ease.
12/22/17,5,"Charlie Elliot has delivered a first class customer experience for me , couldn't have asked for any more when buying a new car and has definitely secured future business for his company and Mini.

Highly recommend"
12/22/17,5,"Recently bought a used Avensis tourer from Inchcape Oxford, customer service could not be faulted. Patricia made the whole experience easy and hassle free, and I felt I was a valued customer. I travelled up from Cornwall to purchase the car, and would not hesitate to do the same again next time I'm in the market for a car."
12/22/17,5,"I had to visit Bury VW recently for a warranty repair.
The staff could not have been more helpful. A courtesy car was provided and my own car was ready ahead of time.
The fault was discovered and repaired successfully.
I'm glad this is my local VW dealer."
12/22/17,5,The service team reminded me that I was due a service. They made it easy to book in and arranged a courtesy car. Great service
12/22/17,5,"Difficult to see how they could have been better. Everything was handled just the way you think it should be - courteous, prompt, friendly and helpful. Plus they send you a video of the technician actually working on your car talking you through the condition report.
Brilliant. I wouldn't go anywhere else else."
12/21/17,1,"Waited a week longer than promised & still arrived the following day at a different time
Given wrong reg no a week earlier
Car arrived driven not on trailer
Car was absolutely filthy with chip on paint which was impossible to see due to filth covering car
No introduction to controls etc on hand over
Merc insurance had run out before I had received car
Laura & Bryan we’re both very pleasant to deal with but ???
The car is an E300 which is superb"
12/21/17,5,"Very good service and our new Bmw x3 Xdrive Msport is perfect.
Michael Williams made the hole experience a delight thank you cooper Bmw Tunbridge Wells"
12/21/17,3,"For the member of staff that dealt with me, I am happy to award a star. For the use of a courtesy car, I am happy to award a star. I award a star for the first annual service which is routine, and not difficult to get right. However, little else is deserved.
I am dissatisfied because.....
I have an issue with my panoramic roof making a noise and asked for this to be assessed and hopefully rectified. Upon return of my car is was evident within minutes of driving it that the roof had not been sorted. So it would be reasonable to question whether the mechanic has actually tested it after the so called 'repair', otherwise why return a car purporting to have rectified the problem? I am now going to have to return to the garage which is an inconvenience.
Also, upon collection it was obvious that my car hadn't been cleaned (as would be expected) I received an apology, and the car was whisked off for a clean. They may as well have not bothered! It was a poor job, and it certainly wasn't vacuumed.
Very disappointed."
12/21/17,5,"I have used the services of Cooper BMW Colchester in the past and have never felt that I've been looked after very well at all. I purchased a new vehicle from another dealer in 2016 and decided to book it in at Cooper BMW Colchester for its first service to save me the hassle of travelling. The experience when booking the car in over the phone didn't give me any reason to change my opinion. However on the day, I was met with a polite and sincere welcome at reception and as there was no one immediately free to attend to me, the receptionist made me a cup of coffee and made sure I was comfortable while I waited. Soon after this, Alicia introduced herself, left me to enjoy my coffee while she dealt with booking my vehicle in. She went out of her way to describe what was to be done, how the 'Service Inclusive' package worked and helped me make a very useful decision. As the lift home I had arranged was not immediately available a cab was immediately arranged. I received a video during the afternoon summarising what had been done and telling me my vehicle was in good shape. Later, I received a call to say the service had been completed and a cab back to the dealership was arranged, where I was informed all the work that had been done was covered under the Service Inclusive' package and there was nothing to pay. For the first time ever, I felt that my custom was important to them, long may it continue."
12/21/17,5,I took my car for a brake fluid change. the staff are so helpful. and polite. and plenty of refreshments free

12/21/17,4,"Overall experience was good, Coopers have upped there game recently and customer care seems to have improved. Appointments were not not always on time, but generally, very good."
12/21/17,5,"Helpful service and Lee Craske went as far as he could and then a bit further to help us get the car we wanted at a very good price.
Would recommend him and the car experience to anyone interested in a new Mini."
12/21/17,2,"Inchcape Volkswagen the company that employee convicted criminal and drink drivers in Head of Business positions.

As confirmed In The Argus Times from the in the dock segment.
The quote below is taken directly from the newspaper.

""Bradley John Lawrence, aged 32, of Homewood in Findon, pleaded guilty to driving a Volkswagen goods vehicle near Lyminster Road while over the drink drive limit on April 26. Made subject of community order including curfew for ten weeks, victim surcharge of £60, £85 costs and disqualified from driving for two years""

To cap it off he was even driving a VW vehicle at the time. For me drink driving is absolutely disgraceful so I think its important for others to be aware of the people VW employee in these positions. I personally don't want to deal with someone who has been convicted of this offence."
12/21/17,5,"Excellent service from VW Colchester, Ian from the service department was very helpful."
12/21/17,1,"Disgusting experience!!!

The prices charged are daylight robbery! The only way people would pay the price of a service here is if they had no choice. If you are a Mercedes Agility customer you do not have a choice, or so you are told by the dealership.

£600 for a service that would be £100 in a local garage. Also you are forced into paying high prices for work that is not necessary all because you are told if you do not get this work done ""You will invalidate your warranty"".

Is this practice legal? I would be keen to find out."
12/21/17,4,"O issues, everyone as requested, and without any hitches.

Car Cole tex and returned very professionally

Many thanks

Eddie"
12/21/17,1,"I booked my car in online for a service. I selected a particular time to drop it in and expected it to be done in a couple of hours. I drove 45 minutes to get there and was told that I had selected to leave it all day.
There was no indication on the website that this was the case. I was not prepared to have to wait around all day for it to be done so agreed to bring it another day.
When I took it back in, I asked them to check for a very obvious rattle that happens when it’s being driven. I left the car with them for 6 hours and when I collected it I was informed that the engineer could not find the rattle. Not once was I contacted to say they were struggling to find it and could I go for a drive with them so now, I have to book it in for third time. Not happy.
The lady I dealt with was very nice but my experience has not been a good one"
12/21/17,4,"Excellent customer service by Pam who was most attentive, and who kept me constantly updated on progress re my car service. My error was not to have booked a dedicated slot as I brought the car in earlier than my book in time (as invited so to do) but this didn't make its service any earlier, and I ended up killing time in Cheltenham for 5 hours!"
12/21/17,5,"Excellent courteous staff,I was helped quickly by my service Manger Marc Chadwick,an extremely Professional and helpful Manager,10 out of 10.
I had to wait 1hour and a half,plenty of coffee. Sadly no Daily Papers at all so a bad point,surely there should be at least a choice of Daily Papers for customers to read rather then a Free Local Paper! Hopefully Cooper Tonbridge will address this!
Not Jennifer Oudes but her husband!"
12/21/17,5,"My A5 went in for a second service and i cannot fault Inchcape Uk Maidstone with their professionalism and speed they turned my car around. The collection and drop off service from my house is excellent and my car was returned clean and looking good as new. Highly recommend Inchcape and will use again.
Thankyou"
12/21/17,5,Brilliant service once again. Victoria Binnington was brilliant.
12/21/17,5,I have used Hunters over a number of years and again when just before Christmas they repaired a warranty issue quickly and efficiently without any hassle which was much appreciated.
12/21/17,5,"Was treated really well by Lisa in the service dept , ‘tis a pity that this is her final week with Inchcape , however my previous visits have always been pretty spot on , but this particular visit was friendly , efficient and funny I hope you can get a Lisa replacement !"
12/21/17,5,"Very personable service, car turned round quickly, clear price quoted."
12/21/17,5,Great service
12/21/17,5,"Great experience. We dealt with Phil Graylen who was awesome. Lots of info and help all the way and an overall painless and pleasant experience. If I knew buying new cars was like this, I'd have done it years ago!"
12/21/17,5,Was happy to see my car returned nice and clean. Also the garage telephoned me before and after to make sure I was kept informed. Overall very happy with the service.
12/21/17,5,"great service and very professional ,very happy"
12/21/17,5,Had all work completed exactly as quoted at the price quoted and within the time frame estimated. Staff are very efficient and friendly.
12/20/17,5,"Unfortunately I hit a pothole in my car late Sunday night and by the following afternoon a new tire had arrived and had been fitted. The garage was clearly very busy yet I still received impeccable service from Julie, she provided me with a lovely hot beverage and kept me updated as to how long my car would be, she then showed me to my car and I genuinely felt she went above and beyond to make my
experience as pain free as possible! Looking forward to my service in May, thanks VW."
12/20/17,1,Very poor service received from BMW in Cobham. Makes me regret getting my service done here and has totally destroyed my faith and confidence in the brand.
12/20/17,4,Get customer service right from entering the car park to leaving.Everything explained well and video of underside of car was excellent. Only feedback is that It would have been good if I was taken to my car after all finished as struggled to find it amongst all the cars.
12/20/17,5,"My car was in for a service . Swift handover of keys at the service dept, driven to my place of work and collected when I finished work to collect my car. Great service from service dept, driver and car was immaculately clean on collection"
12/20/17,1,The service i recived in mercedes liverpool was poor. I had left my bank card at home and the cost of the tire was £190 i told them i could tranfer the money from my phone to a account and they said they only take card payments. Ad they couldnt take that as payment they wouldnt let me take my car. i got there at 9 oclock and did leave till 11 oclcock as i had to wait for awork friend to make payment on card for me. I advise people not to use inchape mercedes liverpool for any services.
12/20/17,5,Very helpful friendly staff everything ran really smoothly for the purchase of my lovely new mini 😃
12/20/17,3,"Got Hybrid Passat only a week old, booked it to software update and investigate the battery charging ( it charges to 24 miles instead of 31). The garage asked me to bring the charge cable which I did but at the end of the day they did not investigate but explained it will improve with use which could have been explained over the phone and software update wouldn't take 6 hours"
12/20/17,4,"My experience with my recent service was a huge improvement on last year. Someone was ready to hand over my courtesy car the minute I arrived, staff were welcoming and polite, my car was ready at the expected time and was cleaned beautifully, again with great customer service upon collection. Thank you."
12/20/17,4,Efficient. Generally a good service but lacking in some respects due possibly to a refurbishment of the showrooms. However having experienced another Mercedes garage recently I would have awarded that garage 5 stars.
12/20/17,5,Excellent - Very Helpful
12/20/17,5,"First service for our Q5, excellent service from booking in to picking up. Audi know how to deliver great customer experience, unlike so many companies who talk about it Audi actually deliver it. We bought the vehicle at Audi Basingstoke & they were brilliant & Tetbury Audi have continued the positive experience. Thank you."
12/20/17,3,"Did the express service and supposed to be 1and a half hours max, took nearly 2 and a half hours. Even the one guy said they weren't doing very well with the express service times. If it takes 2 and a half hours just tell your customers the truth so that they can make a better judgement.

Other than that service was good"
12/20/17,5,Great service always keep in contact and car service completed within time agreed. Car valeted to a good standard
12/20/17,5,"Car collected and returned as requested and confirmed.

Small point, the inside of the windows has not been done very well."
12/20/17,1,"I purchased a 2 year Service plan for my new Polo. At the second service, yesterday, the car was presented back to me with unwashed front wheels and poorly washed rear wheels. I pointed this out to the member of staff who was looking after me and he offered to rectify it. The result of the second attempt was still very poor with large areas of the wheels uncleaned. He told me the wash was complimentary and I took that to mean that I had to put up with what was presented.
On checking the wash is part of the plan I paid for and as such was totally unsatisfactory and well below the standard I expected from VW......especially as I am a long term returning customer."
12/20/17,1,"I dropped off my mini the afternoon before it’s service and MOT were due I was not given a rough estimate on when it would be ready the following day. I had not received a call from Coopers by 1:15 to say my car was ready so I tried to call, after hanging on the phone I was eventually told that nobody was there to take the call and that they would call back and hour later this still had not happened so I called again, I was told this time that there was nobody in the service centre so I told them I wanted to know what time my car would be ready so wanted to speak to somebody they put me through to an extension which rang and rang and then cut me off. On the third attempt to call I was put through to BMW who told me they were dealing with my service and it would be ready at 3:30. Communication was appalling and not what I would expect from Coopers I will take my car to Fairfield next time."
12/20/17,5,"Fantastic experience buying my car, staff very professional and knowledgable. Couldn’t be happier with the hand over and loving the car."
12/20/17,5,First class service. Brought car to my home 50 miles away
12/20/17,5,"Great dealership with fantastic customer service
Really look after your bmw with care."
12/20/17,4,"I recently bought a used Audi A4 Allroad from Adam Barleycorn at Audi Tunbridge Wells. Adam was very good and attentive even though he had only been with Audi for a few months. If he didn't know, then he went and found out anything that I needed answering. I was also looked after by the Business Manager, Tony Wallis with final payment etc who was friendly and knowledgeable"
12/20/17,5,Always quick and courteous service.
12/20/17,5,Can recommend this dealership and have returned to them time and again
12/20/17,5,"Excellent service, good communication! My car was collected at my home for the job required and was delivered back within the scheduled time!"
12/20/17,4,Sorted the car out very quickly and better than my last BMW dealer where I bought the car.
12/20/17,5,quick service efficiently delivered and went beyond what I could have reasonably expected when it was discovered my booking was with Inchcape Cheltenham and not Swindon as expected!
12/20/17,5,It was so smooth and easy from initial booking to picking it back up again. My wife and I were very well looked after and had a lovely time on the Christmas markets while our car was served.
12/20/17,5,Ashley was super helpful during the entire process - thanks!
12/20/17,5,"Inchcape slotted my car in for a diagnostic check up at short notice and carried out tests, enabling me to travel over the festive period with confidence. Service was professional and all costs clearly explained.
The car was returned to me after a wash and tidy up - which was appreciated."
12/20/17,5,It is a pleasure visiting the site. Mark Chadwick is an exceptional individual who goes the extra mile ensuring I will always return.
12/20/17,5,Excellent service
12/20/17,5,Great service
12/20/17,5,"There was some confusion when booking my vehicle in for a service regarding the time the vehicle would be delivered back to me. (My vehicle is on a 'collect and return' contract for servicing). However, special arrangements were made to collect the car early to ensure that it was back with me well within my deadline. I was very impressed with this level of flexibility. Excellent customer service!"
12/20/17,5,"I only have good things to say about MB coventry. Right from reception you are greeted with a smile, we had the pleasure of being assisted by Zee to pick out a new car . He was very attentive to our needs and ensured we got exactly what we wanted and even more. Communication was great, he kept us updated on what was going on and what to expect over the coming days. During the prehand over we had people from other departments tell us about possible service plans and certain covers we hadnt thought about such as tyre insurance and gap insurance. On the handover day it was obvious that a lot of thought was put into it and it was very personalised. It was such a good experience overall and we look forward to coming back to MB coventry for future cars. We cant thank Zee enough for all his help."
12/20/17,5,good job done. I would recommend banstead bmw. thanks
12/20/17,4,"I took my Mini in early in the day for service, MOT, etc and was very pleased that all the work was done and it was ready to collect mid afternoon as requested. I was kept up to date with progress including a little video of the tyres and underneath of the car.

My only complaint is that the car park was so full of cars both in the morning and afternoon that it was very difficult to park and virtually impossible to turn round!"
12/20/17,5,Did what they said they would do and on time and at a competitive price.
12/20/17,5,Best customer service I've ever come across for a car company. Much better than Audi.
12/20/17,5,"First class service from James Bowyer, really made me feel welcome and a pleasure to do business with him."
12/20/17,5,Really good service.
12/20/17,5,Excellent flexible service. Undertaken in the time suggested. All round first rate performance.
12/20/17,3,"My car was in for a service the person who felt with me was very helpful,but the valet of the car after the service was poor"
12/20/17,5,"Very good service, feeling of trustworthiness."
12/20/17,5,"Hunters Landrover Kings Lynn
I found Richard & Nick most helpful with the sale and purchase of my new car and would thourouly recomend Both them and Hunters to anyone contemplating exchanging there car."
12/20/17,3,"Started off fine but car wasn’t collected when they said it would be then waited 2 3/4 hours from when car was ready to having it dropped off.
If I’d known it’d taken so long to return I would’ve collected it myself but was blatantly lied to by the guy who was dealing with it - telling me the car was on its way but not arriving till over an hour later (he said traffic was busy but I’m only 7 mins from dealership!!)
Poor customer relations but it’s being lied to that annoys.
If I was told the truth then I could have made arrangements to get the car earlier - will think about using another garage for both my Mercedes in future."
12/20/17,5,"My first bmw from cooper bmw, the whole experience was fantastic, very professional and welcoming knew exactly what they were talking about and all round genuine people. My salesman Kai who dealt with me, did everything he said he would and made the whole experience enjoyable. Highley recommend cooper Colchester"
12/20/17,3,"Got there on time and was given a brew and directed to the waiting room which has its own little office so you can do some work while you wait. Unfortunately I was sat there for 20 minutes before the service manager came in. I sow specifically mentioned to him that the Sim card reader wasn't working. He said the service would take about 2 hours but it was more like 2.5 hours. During this time I asked the receptionist if I could have another brew but despite saying yes, she didn't. When car was ready nd the manager ran through the work done I asked if the Sim reader had been fixed and he said yes as they had updated the MMI. Got home and Sim reader still not working. So overall can't say I'm very impressed, especially at £355."
12/20/17,1,"I love my BMW. I have had them for years, but I recently had an electrical fault with my car. I contacted Coopers to ask for help. I nice guy said that my service is due soon and if I was to book it in, they would take a look and give me some advice. He also said that if the problem worsened “Please bring it in sooner.” Great I thought, somebody who really cared about my car and good customer service. I was then passed to a person who booked me in for a “Large filter service.” I booked it in even though I was shocked at the price.

When I arrived for my service I was given to a rather officious person who told me that “You are here for a Brakes Service.” When I told her that that was not my understanding she seemed quite abrupt and also said that BMW would charge me £95 to look at the electrical fault. The incongruence of the servicing and the hardening of the attitude about my electrical fault left me feeling quite angry and frustrated.

On the show room wall there is a statement about how Coopers want their customers to feel “Completely Satisfied.” Well it worked, I am completely satisfied that I will not use Coopers again."
12/19/17,1,Very bad service
12/19/17,5,"Service and first MOT completed efficiently with the minimum of fuss. Very nice gentleman whose name I unfortunately didn’t get dealt with me and even allowed me to hang on to the loan car overnight. He was one of the older ones!
We’ve been using VW Stockport now for 10 years and will be looking buying the wife’s 4th Golf, or perhaps new model Polo, next year."
12/19/17,1,"1. I was quoted £748.00, over £100 more for a service on my Range Rover with Hunters Norwich, than with 2 other Land Rover main dealers. Once they were told, they matched the lower quote immediately. Why over quote in the first place?
2. I asked the service team to diagnose an engine noise in addition to the service. Hunters gave a very vague diagnosis and the quote was based on changing a number of parts, “just in case” (I could have done that myself, free and saved myself £60 for the guesstimate)
3. Land Rover claimed my rear wash wiper had ceased and that they could free it up for £26.
Funny as it worked on the way to Land Rover, and on the way back despite not having the work done!
4. Land Rover diagnosed a small oil leak on the engine, no further information unless I agreed to pay £150.00 to diagnose.
5. Land Rover diagnosed excessive play in my suspension at 92831 miles!
MOT tested at 92630 only 200 miles before the service and no Advisory’s!!!
6. The finale... drove the car some 20 miles home following the service and checked my documents. Land Rover must have been so busy trying to open my wallet that they have forgotten to stamp my service book... how annoying as after all this is what we pay twice the price of the actual service costs for, isn’t it???
Avoid at all costs!"
12/19/17,5,I booked my service via the call centre and when I arrived was greeted by Harish. He went through everything and I was away in no time. I got a call from Harish with an update and to advise me when my vehicle will be ready. I arrived to pick my car up and met Harish again who went through everything they did on my vehicle and explained everything well. He then walked me to my vehicle and asked if there’s anything else he could do to help. Well done Mercedes for employing someone who really cares and goes that extra mile.
12/19/17,5,"Having purchased my Countryman at the beginning of this year I took the car in this week for its first service by this dealership. I found the booking process easy and helpful. The car was taken in for its service on time and completed within the time stated having also had a full wash and vacuuming. There was a couple of small queries re the car which were quickly and efficiently handled by the admin staff.

I have given this dealership a 5 star rating because of the pleasant and efficient staff that I dealt with and also the standard with which the car was returned to me. I am pleased to be able to ""highly"" recommend Cooper Norwich Mini."
12/19/17,5,"Very satisfied with all aspects of the service from Crawley Audi. The ordering of my new car, part exchanging my previous vehicle and collecting my new Audi were handled very smoothly and professionally."
12/19/17,3,"I had difficulties from the start, three unreturned calls, after which I visited the branch to get an answer to be told no I couldn’t use the voucher I was given 6 months prior on the purchase. I had to contact Durham used sales manager who resolve the issue he was very good. Then on the booking day at Teesside Debbie did not give any clear information on warranty and no cost on a issue, did not explain the loan car and any cost involved, clarity on a cost of a part and fitting. I have again called the branch who said they would call me back and haven’t. Very poor after care service. Needed a price on two tyres, the system wasn’t working but no offer to email me the cost when it was up and working so I will be spending that money else where. This is the first car I have bought from cooper and I would say I have no trust in Teesside. I would rather forfeit the cooper approved than trust in the Teesside service."
12/19/17,5,Comfortable surroundings and quick service.
12/19/17,5,Exccellent service with lovely coffee
12/19/17,5,"Met by efficient and friendly staff
Very professional staff
Would have no hesitation in recommending this dealership"
12/19/17,5,"Excellent service with attention to detail and also friendly and informative.
Callum - thank you.."
12/19/17,5,Excellent staff and service. Would recommend Derby Lexus to anyone.
12/19/17,5,"Professional service completed on time whilst I waited. Car computer updated correctly and fully, good valet. Following bad experience at South Ascot this has restored my faith in BMW. Thanks."
12/19/17,5,"The person who phoned to ask me if I wanted to book my car in was very friendly and helpful. I received an e-mail reminder of my appointment. As usual the staff at the garage (Altrincham) were helpful and Jenny even organised a lift for me to go home after checking my car in. She phoned me promptly to tell me when my car was ready to collect and came out with me to check my car,"
12/19/17,5,Had a puncture on the way to a Christmas lunch with an old friend and called in to see if they would change the wheel or fix it. All done by the most friendly staff on the desk and in the workshop. Puncture repaired and we were on our way in no time. Superb service
12/19/17,5,"The whole buying experience, from our first meeting with
Tom Matten in Tetbury to collecting our new car only yesterday was top quality.
He listened to our requirements and offered good advice and guidance to help us decide on the right specification at a reasonable price, especially with the Audi scrappage scheme deal for our Honda.
With the order placed, we enjoyed tracking the progress of our car build and shipment to the UK and the video he sent us of it on arrival in the dealership was an especially nice touch.
Collection of our car was also handled very smoothly - the paperwork, the explanation of the car’s features and functions...
Overall,it was a very professional and actually quite enjoyable experience.
And most importantly, we are very pleased with our new car."
12/19/17,1,"Terrible service. THis was a waiting service of 90 mins. Reality was 3 hours, just waiting in the show room. Always was going to be another 5 minutes sir"
12/19/17,4,"Positives;
Booking service was quick and easy.
Nice welcome at showroom.
Promptly dealt with at service desk.
Negative;
Nearly £300 for oil and filter change is difficult to accept."
12/19/17,5,"Serviced my car at short notice. Very professional and helpful staff.
No complaints. Keep up the good work."
12/19/17,4,"Great, fast and friendly service. I had a new tyre fitted as got a screw in mine and was in and out straight away as they had my tyre in stock. My only concern was when i came to change the tyre on my driveway i couldn't find the jack. I mentioned this to the service team and although they have done all the services and work over the 2 1/2 years of the cars life they said i would have to pay to get a new one."
12/19/17,5,"Good service but paperwork was not correct but has been sorted immediately.
Staff very polite."
12/19/17,5,"Credit where credit is due, my first experience with VW Inchape Service Department at Shrewsbury was a very pleasant one. I was very impressed with the efficiency, response time and genuinely helpful attitude from start to finish and I was kept updated by email, phone and a video inspection!
I own a 2015 VW Amarok, and the VW Van Centre I purchased it from in Shrewsbury has since closed. It was due it's first major service and Inchape handled it all very well indeed and in a crystal clear manner and a courtesy car and wash & valet as well!. Many thanks indeed to Ellie & Lauren who turned a normally unsatisfying and costly chore into a strangely pleasant experience!

Many Thanks & best wishes for Christmas & the New Year!"
12/19/17,5,Excellent. Needed the car urgently and carried out the service quickly.
12/19/17,5,Very friendly and professional service and the price was more competitive than I expected.
12/19/17,5,"Molly my contact was just amazing from beginning to end. I was kept totally informed with the progress of my mini, and any questions were answered almost immediately. However, this all changed when it came to the free insurance. The website didn’t work, so Molly was unable to organise it. I ended up on the phone twice trying, initially they wouldn’t allow me to organise it either. They were a nightmare to deal with and would not protect my nine years plus no claims bonus. It spoilt my whole experience. Inchcape, you need to change insurance providers, they’re letting you down!"
12/19/17,5,You always know both you and your car are being well looked after. I have no hesitation in recommending this company
12/19/17,4,"Great garage, all work was done on time. Great customer service. I appreciated the part department that did not push for a sale but instead gave me an honest answer. Nice waiting area and free coffee! Only put 4 stars as it was my first visit , hopefully will have a great experience next time and will award 5 stars 🌟"
12/19/17,5,Put BMW Z4 for its MOT at 8am and went for breakfast nearby - came back at 9.30am and car ready to drive away - fast and efficient service as usual !!
12/19/17,5,"My sales agent Simon was attentive and courteous. Handled everything professionally.

Very impressed with the facilities."
12/19/17,5,"Friendly, helpful reception and handover. Excellent service."
12/19/17,5,Good experience. Car was accepted at the time booked and was ready for collection mid way through afternoon. Courteous staff kept me informed of progress with a useful email with a video of the inspection. Would recommend.
12/19/17,4,A Very good service ! Advisor Jenna was very informative and obliging kind regards lee
12/19/17,5,"excellent attention to detail, quick and efficient staff, with genuine interest in me as a person not just another customer."
12/19/17,5,"Booked in for annual service. Slight delay in pickup (house is a little hard to get to) but they kept me in the loop, did a good job and a free wash in/out. Recommended."
12/19/17,4,Just an MOT this time round. Acceptable wait in pleasant showroom. Car returned washed & hoovered as always. Also had a 'health check'. Pleasantly surprised to find when I got home my oil & washer fluid had been topped up with no charge. I like that attention to detail.
12/19/17,5,"Customer Satisfaction
Once again I can't fault the service that I recieve from Inscape Mercedes Derby. These guys really know how to treat a customer. Felt like an individual and a valid customer and not just a number.

Special thanks must go to Robyn."
12/19/17,3,"Overall my experience was satisfactory, but no better than I would've had if i'd gone to an independent garage. The experience dealing with the service advisor was good, he was very friendly. I was less than impressed with the loan car I was given. I drive a 1 Series BMW and was given a 2 series as a loan car, it was big and absolutely horrible to drive! I returned to the garage in the evening to collect my car, upon starting the engine there was a loud knocking noise coming from underneath. I was advised that I could either take the loan car again and leave mine or return again the next morning to have a technician look at it. I explained there was no chance i'd be taking the loan car again as it was horrible to drive, but was offered no alternative and opted to drive away with my rattling car. As someone who drives a nearly new premium brand car and chooses to have this serviced by the main dealer, I'd really hoped paying the premium for dealer servicing would leave me with a stress and worry free experience... Instead, I had to drive a loan car which didn't fit my needs very well and I've got to take more time out of my busy day to go back and have something checked that shouldn't need re checking!

My advice..... Find a decent local garage and save your money!"
12/19/17,5,great service and have always been spot on with me. Good coffee whilst I waited too!
12/19/17,5,"Great service for a tyre replacement from the call at 8am, to the appointment at 11am and all fixed by 1pm. This included the tyre insurance process and getting the car cleaned and vacuumed just in time for Christmas."
12/19/17,5,"Consistent good, polite service from every member of staff we have ever dealt with over a number of years. Always refreshing to receive such consideration when standards appear to be sadly reducing generally."
12/19/17,5,"I went to Audi Macclesfield on the recommendation of my son-in-law. I could not be happier with the experience I enjoyed there. Neil Cameron looked after me so well, keeping me informed of the car’s progress from ordering to delivery. It arrived on the day stated. The service I got was 5*. I would recommend Audi Macclesfield to anyone. I am thrilled with my new car and would like to thank Neil and his team for looking after me so well."
12/19/17,5,The car recall fault was dealt with quickly and efficiently within the time frame given. I was treated exactly the same as if my car was being serviced or repaired. Polite friendly staff for whom nothing is too much trouble.
12/19/17,4,Work was completed on time and the car returned washed and cleaned. Excellent service!
12/18/17,5,Absolutely brilliant service my car was ready when I asked for it to be ready! Really really helpful can not fault any of the service you receive from bmw! Nothing is too much effort and very thorough we are very impressed
12/18/17,5,always a pleasure to visit the staff are very attentive and always have your needs at hand. the showroom is always spotless and i just cant fault them. i would highly recommend them to anyone.
12/18/17,5,"Booked in next day for an ad-blue top up. £19 for the Ad-blue and a free visual check and report and full valet. And all very polite and professional.
Excellent!"
12/18/17,5,"Service carried out in agreed time frame, comprehensive written report of findings provided and main points discussed at collection"
12/18/17,5,"Although I was late taking my car for its service, I was treated extremely well from the moment I arrived to the moment I collected my car later in the day. Minor issues with the car were explained and the evidence shown to me. Car cleaned and looked like new even though it is 4 years old.
BRILLIANT SERVICE"
12/18/17,5,The best service I have ever had and I would recommend Audi Swindon and Marcus Imrie every time.
12/18/17,5,"Great, friendly & professional service from Ellie & Chris @ Cooper Mini Durham.
We just called in for a look & ended up buying a fabulous countryman.
I’ve gone from BMW to MINI & I’m loving it."
12/18/17,5,"Booked for MOT, took no longer than 1 hour 30 mins which allowed me to work undisturbed upstairs. Great coffee too! Work was completed on my car with a full wash and valet included. No hassle - will definitely use Macc again."
12/18/17,5,"Fantastic.
Sophie came in on her day off to do the hand over,we were made to feel very important,the hand over in that glass room is just something else."
12/18/17,2,Had asked for rear wiper to be replaced and when I arrived to collect my car was in the report advised that the rear wiper needed replacing. I complained that I had specifically asked for it to be replaced and was then advised that they had none in stock and would have to order. After a 60 mile round trip I felt disappointed by my visit.
12/18/17,5,We were very happy with the service which led up to the purchase of our Mini. Cooper's representative was thorough and professional. No hesitation in recommending them.
12/18/17,2,"My BMW 2 Series Active Sport was recalled for a software update. When the car was returned the dashcam was not working. It worked fine before. On closer inspection the dashcam power lead had been plugged into the wrong dashcam apperature and luckily no damage was done. It cost over £300. It took me considerable time to establish the root cause, in the dark and in artic conditions. I then had to reboot and re set the settings as well as recalibration of the dash-cam ADAS system. Lesson learnt, remove the dashcam before any engineering work takes place by Cooper BMW."
12/18/17,5,We bought a used BMW 1 series from Cooper Reading. As part of the transaction we part exchanged our 2006 Audi. Mark Jeffery dealt with us and was excellent. From knowledge on the cars to general professionalism we couldn't fault him. The actual dealership was very impressive as well with 200+ used cars. We can 100% recommend using Mark and BMW Cooper Reading.
12/18/17,5,Highly recommended superb customer service A****** from me 👍
12/18/17,2,"Reasonable reception and a pretty visual check video , could not compensate for the £110 bill for a replacement valve . Equal tyre pressures at 1.3 bar and a missing dust cap when checking later further reduced the perceived quality of the service."
12/18/17,5,"Friendly, helpful staff and the coffee is great!"
12/18/17,5,Excellent. Very good welcome and efficient service.
12/18/17,3,"No complaint about the service you performed on my car, first class as I would expect.
Very disappointed at your attitude to me performing diagnostics on MY car.
I like to be aware of how the car is performing from the logs and that it is being appropriately maintained by Inchcape. It would not be in my interest to reset DTCs and I would not do that."
12/18/17,5,"I'm a regular customer at Cheshire oaks Audi, and i always find the staff helpful,polite and their attention to detail impeccable.
Keep up the good work."
12/18/17,5,"Great Customer experience, from walking in for a browse to driving away in my new car took 10 days! Excellent services, no hard sell, Daniel Perkis listened and delivered. Nothing else to add, first class all round."
12/18/17,5,An excellent service which was particularly helpful to me as I currently have a broken leg. The pick up and deliver to home service solved my problems and allowed the MOT to be undertaken in a timely and trouble free way. Thank you Audi.
12/18/17,5,Quick response to enquiry and good customer service.
12/18/17,3,"Dropped the car off at 08:50am. Asked how long the service/mot would take. Was told 2.5 hrs as we were ‘first in’. Got to 13:30hrs and thought I would call. Lady on the phone tried to call the garage (they are in the same building, on the same floor), no reply. Said she would call back. She called back two further times and eventually advised a 15:30pm collection. We lost the whole day to be honest. Very poor communication. They really should have called to advise how long it was going to be.

Furthermore, we have owned the car from new 5 yrs ago. I purchased a cherished number plate which was fitted within 6 months yet still, the VW garage have failed to update their system after being given this information every year the car is serviced. It really is a ‘carry on’ to book the car in for a service.

We have always used VW for our servicing but I really do wonder whether I will use them in future."
12/18/17,5,"Well planned and all tasks undertaken, whilst looked after at the same time."
12/18/17,5,"I am a returning customer to Cooper Norwich, having bought 4 cars from them previously. The service was excellent and not pushy, as some car manufacturers can be. The premises is easy to find and has everything one could wish for. I took delivery of my new M140i and have yet to find anything to criticise."
12/18/17,5,Good service all round
12/18/17,5,All staff very helpful and mostly knowledgeable
12/18/17,5,"A brilliant service, courteous and efficient"
12/18/17,5,Service was great! They told me 12:30 but they were able to finish 1 hour earlier! Easy fast and efficient!
12/18/17,5,"Looking for my next car, spoke with Danny, he took us round the cars on the forecourt, he explained some of the special offers on the run up to Christmas we decided on a pre reg Q5 with only 17 miles on the clock good deal, good price, no pressure a very easy person to do business with, so much so we decided to change my wife's car also to a A4 avant again another fair deal.
The handover made you feel special , looking for an Audi give these guys a go, Speak with Danny he will look after you, the other members of the team also very friendly."
12/18/17,5,"quick and efficient, excellent service"
12/18/17,4,"Very efficient,waited longer than expected but a good outcome"
12/18/17,5,Hunters have proved to be an excellent dealership. From the moment I walked in I was made to feel welcome. The sales staff asked good questions to understand my requirements and it was also nice to be left to do the test drive by myself so I could form my own views. The subsequent sales process was seamless and as a new customer to Land Rover I was impressed by the welcome letters and brochures. Nice touches such as the video of the car prior to collection were appreciated and the thorough handover was comprehensive. At every stage everything I asked for was provided and I couldn’t have asked for more from a dealership. Buying a new car can be an intimidating process but the professionalism of the Hunters team meant it has been a pleasure dealing with them - they are very highly recommended.
12/18/17,3,"Service was fine but car war collected by someone who couldn't speak English, so it was a bit disconcerting to hand the keys over. Car should have been back by 4pm but didn't come back until 6pm."
12/18/17,5,INCECAPE HAVE A GREAT CUSTOMER RELATIONS ADVISOR IN JAMES WHO WAS VERY HELPFUL WITH ALL MY CONCERNS AND NEEDS TO MAKE MY CAR SERVICE RUN SMOOTHLY FROM TIME OF BOOKING THE CAR IN FOR IT'S SERVICE TO COLLECTION ON COMPLETION .
12/18/17,2,Lovely staff however car went in for an inspection they offered to hoover car as washers were frozen so this couldn’t be washed and only half the car was hoovered not the best service if your offering
12/18/17,3,"The work was completed on time and i like the fact that I get a video update.

I was kept waiting in the morning for around 30 minutes to book it in which is maybe understandable given that lots of people arrive at 8am.

I was also kept waiting for at least 20 minutes at collection time which is less understandable.

My car was not washed as advertised."
12/18/17,2,"I booked vehicle in for coolant check as light on dash after a recent service, i was told the winter health check would take 45 mins and bring in at 8.15. I arrived at 8.10 and also mentioned an indicator fault too as it puts my full beam when indicating. Att 10.30 i had to ask for my car back as i was already late for a meeting and no one came to discuss why it was taking so long until after 10 am. I hadn't been advised of any pricing this had to be sent later due to staffing issues in parts. When i received the quote which was in excess of £1,000 there was no offer of goodwill, it has a FSH with this dealer and purchased from the dealer. Whats the point of loyalty?? I'm due to change my car mid next year, let me think do i go for Mercedes and do i go back to the dealer!!"
12/18/17,5,"Great customer service, I felt special. Thank you to the Lexus team at Derby for their professional approach and fast problem solving."
12/18/17,4,"I took my vehicle into Macclesfield Inchcape to have a small repair done to my nearside wing mirror which I had caught on a concrete post on my drive whilst reversing.They ordered 2 parts which were an indicator light and a plastic cap piece,both of which were minimally damaged. When I went to pick my car up after the repair I was told that there was some cosmetic damage to the casing which I was most surprised about considering that my car had gone there to be repaired. Upon inspection, it appeared that there was a small piece of plastic which had broken away between the metal mirror cap and the plastic cap piece as noted above. Now,whilst I realise that this had been caused by my reversing on my drive, and was not done within the garage, it would have been nice if this had been identified at the time of quotation or at least someone could have phoned and let me know at the time of the repair because I would have had the other damaged piece replaced. However, it is not a major issue but it does mean that I have had to purchase a tube of black sealant to fill in the small gap between the plastic cap piece and the metal cap, something which,cosmetically,I would have thought could have been done by the garage at the time of repair."
12/18/17,5,"Excellent service, friendly and easy to deal with.
Would recommend to anyone"
12/18/17,1,"Repair/diagnostics
I took my car to be repaired (hopefully) as the rear window was not de-misting. I dropped it off at 8.45, and was not rung until 4.05 that day to be told it was going to cost £398 to repair. I did not agree to spend that kind of money - had to pay £144 for the honour of being told what I already knew, and I was without my car ALL day, just to be told that. It has cost me £144 for what I believe is nothing - apparently the rear door was stripped don so that they could diagnose the problem, I can see no evidence of this at all (all my rubbish is still in the same place!) absolutely appalled that you think you are justified in asking for that kind of money, and £144 for the car's problem to be diagnosed - at that rate, and you told me it took the engineer 2 hours to strip down, he is earning £72 an hour - who earns that? I shall not be returning my custom to you."
12/18/17,5,Very good service
12/18/17,5,First class service - friendly energetic staff keen to help. Lovely overall experience & would thoroughly recommend them - looking forward to meeting them again in a couple of years when I plan upgrading 👍👍👍
12/18/17,3,Even though I was assured that the car would be ready well in time for me to pick up my grand daughter I had to telephone twice. There was no reply and no phone back so I went there anyway and was told they were just going to phone me. I did pick up my granddaughter but would have been late if I had waited for the phone call. The BMW operator who answered the call was both helpful and sympathetic
12/18/17,5,Lisa was fab offering advise and help on servicing packages - the system went down which was moe difficult and I needed 2 new tyres - we had to rebook the car in they didn’t stock Tiguan tyres which seems odd given it’s a popular car and a little annoying as I flagged it when I booked in - Lisa was really helpful and rang me with tyre prices
12/18/17,5,"The sales lady and manager were very helpful indeed!
The service provide was excellent!"
12/18/17,5,"Great service at Inchape in Altrincham. Everyone knew what they were doing, slick service from arrival through to getting my keys back. I stayed and waited, making use of their wifi and free coffee, allowing me to work while my car was all taken care of - first class"
12/18/17,5,"Mercedes Benz, Juniper Lane, Warrington, Cheshire: Sales team are not pushy at all and will do their best to accommodate your wishes. Finance team also great - worked hard on my behalf to get the best deal for me. Very pleased."
12/18/17,4,"Front of house service team, excellent service."
12/17/17,5,Neil Cameron provided an excellent service. He was very helpful and friendly and kept me up to date at every stage of the sale. Cannot recommend him enough.
12/17/17,5,Excellent service from Adrian and then Ryan. No question too hard to answer and always on hand to help no matter what my question was. Cheers guys!
12/17/17,5,Inchcape Twickenham were helpful and straightforward from the start and gave us a great deal trading in for new car. None of the old sales push and pointless add-ons. Their aftersales service was friendly and helpful too.
12/17/17,5,"We were very pleased with our experience at VW Inchape. Ryan P handled our enquiry, and assisted us in both explaining how to return our old VW and guided us on which new model to go for. We ordered a Tiguan 1.4 (which arrived 4 months early!) and Ryan kept in touch and updated us regularly on its progress. All the paperwork was easily sorted by email and by phone and after we purchased the car, the VW Team were available for any after car enquiries. Really impressed!!"
12/17/17,5,"Great communication with text/e-mail reminders before the appointment, friendly and professional on arrival, made a particular effort to help me with advice on public transport to local town centre while my car was with them, and made sure it was ready to collect at the time I requested. Special thanks to Andy Jenkinson."
12/16/17,1,"The worst garage experience ever. The person assigned to me (Terry) was unhelpful and when the car came back to me it was still filthy. When queried I was told it was 90 pounds for a car wash and it was only goodwill that they do anything to clean it he outside. As far as I am concerned any decent garage would do this as a matter of pride, rather than having the arrogance of a BMW dealer. Need to up you let game, particularly given the promises in your telephone holding message!"
12/16/17,4,"Car collection and delivery, unfortunately their checklist failed and the garage did not update my service book, therefore had to go back to the garage, so convenience was not so convenient"
12/16/17,5,"Great service, whilst waiting for airbag change in the spacious customer lounge, I received a health check video which was a welcomed surprise and.. My car had a wash and valet. Superb!!!.."
12/16/17,3,"Excellent service from the salesman.
However the new car developed a fault after 1 day, and required a new turbo. We were supplied with a hire car after a day and it then took 5 days (including a weekend) to get the new turbo fitted.
Not what you expect with a brand new Audi!
Glad to say the car now fine."
12/16/17,2,"Your excellent salesman (Jack Norton) had arranged for the service dept to do some work on the car I had just bought. He did this verbally and when a date was agreed he confirmed this to me and service dept by email.

When I drove the 30 miles to bring the car in I found I was not expected, no replacement car was available and I was told I would have to make a new appointment and come back another time. An embarrassed receptionist got Jack Norton out of a meeting. He came and spoke with service who reluctantly accepted my car and Jack loaned me his company smart car. Service then took two days to complete a mornings work and still did not manage the job satisfactorily.

I have nothing but praise for your sales dept. It is a great pity that your service department let you down in both administration and attitude."
12/16/17,5,"Took my Mercedes in for regular service, Tim was excellent in booking the car initially, and when I went to drop the car and collect he was very helpful. Also showed how to import my phone directory on the media display of the car. Explained, what has been done to the car, including the brake pipe retrofit recall item.
Finally, whilst waiting to collect the car, prior to handing the keys over he had inspected the car and realised the car had not been washed properly, so he came to apologise and explained needed to re-wash the car."
12/16/17,4,Efficient and polite service thank you
12/16/17,5,Good price given for trade in. Quick to be seen. Always given another name in the absence of dealevand they knew your case.
12/15/17,5,"Not only am I over the moon with my new Mini Cooper S, but the service from sitting down and discussing my order, through to the swift 4 week delivery and collection with super car like unveil was superb!"
12/15/17,5,My experience with Inchcape VW in Swindon is that you will struggle to find better customer service. My car was booked in for a job they were running on time and I even got a free car wash as well. The waiting area was comfortable with as many free drinks as you wanted and all the staff were very polite. I would definitely recommend them.
12/15/17,5,Very good. Professionalism from start to finish.
12/15/17,5,"Request for details of the type of service and the cost was made very clear and handled in a professional and courteous manner by Daniel, Frank and another gentleman whose name I did not get. The car was sent into the workshop on time and completed as agreed.
Would use this dealership again.
RB"
12/15/17,5,Very attentive and courteous. Service carried out well and I was kept informed throughout regarding necessary work.
12/15/17,1,"Could not believe it would take so long. My last visit took 3 hours to change the back brake shoes and two tyres! .
I wanted Jaguar to complete the MOT as this my first Jag. and I thought I would have a quality MOT by trained mechanics.. I was prepared to drive 1 hour each way. The time it took to have an MOT completed and return home was 09:10- 14:45.
My MOT was book in and it took from a 10:30 - 13.45 to complete.
All that was needed was a new bulb, the OS headlight adj. and new wiper blades.

I arrived early as the receptionist suggested. 10:10. I was then left waiting. I asked how it was going at 11:30. There was a delay and it had not been started. It was finished at 13:45! They had cleaned it ""Great""!!!

I was emailed and called at 19:00 hours the previous night to confirm I was attending. Why bother! My experience with The Jaguar Service Team is the worst I have ever had. Car owner for the last 46 years. Would I go there again. No. Just to finish off H.A. Fox called me this morning I was unavailable so they agreed to call back in 30 mins, You've guest it NO Call!!!! Hence the review......."
12/15/17,3,"Altrincham Volkswagen.

Competent at best. Customer service ?

If you enjoy being consistently interrupted spoken over by some customer service representatives deluded by illusion of grandeur - Great."
12/15/17,5,Did everything they said and actually more in the time allocated. Nice clean car too at the end of it.
12/15/17,5,"Friendly staff and prompt, transparent service. Very impressed."
12/15/17,5,"Very impressed with the care taken at all stages of my contact with Inchcape, and the emailed video showing the inspection of my car. Excellent!"
12/15/17,5,Friendly and effecient staff
12/15/17,5,Ben in the service team was fantastic- answered all my questions and concerns. First class experience!
12/15/17,5,From the very first phone call to dilevery was a excellent experience. The salesman ( Andy ) was very knowledgable about his products and only too pleased to share it with me . First class well done guys and thanks
12/15/17,5,"Excellent, attentive staff there!"
12/15/17,5,The experience was excellent. Both representatives we met Darren Williamson and Frances Roberson at Hunters Norwich we’re very professional. 10 out of 10!
12/15/17,4,Very good and friendly service
12/15/17,5,Excellent experience getting my 2 series serviced. Ferried to T Wells and back while work was done and car sparkling on return.

12/15/17,5,Great customer service from Andy and manager Ben. Thanks for making it happen!
12/15/17,5,"Viewed a Discovery sport via internet and contacted company - received detailed information and decided to put on holding deposit.
Traveled to view car and was exactly as described and prepared beautifully - so agreed to purchase.
All paperwork dealt with quickly and professionally and was on my way in less than an hour.
On return home encountered minor issue which was again dealt with quickly and professionally.
Cant praise sales executive (Richard Eyre) highly enough.
Can wholeheartedly fully recommend dealing with this highly professional organisation."
12/15/17,5,Brilliant customer service went through everything in detai! Can’t fault them
12/14/17,5,"Really nice folks
Easy to deal with
Efficient & helpful
Great experience as always
Thanks Inchcape (Shrewsbury)"
12/14/17,5,Very efficient service. Helpful and friendly staff.
12/14/17,3,£227.00 for a light bulb.... not sure what to say!
12/14/17,4,"Collect and return offered free of charge and very much appreciated as we were not in a position to bring the car ourselves. Helpful video to inform as to service findings . Car washed - great!
But car was not returned on time because of need to cover payment first and this quite understood. But I was not contacted until exactly 17.30 by a member of staff on the Service desk and when I tried to ring back seven minutes later to return the call the switchboard was closed and I could not reach him. Meantime a strange BMW was left on our drive overnight without explanation!"
12/14/17,5,"Always very professional and courteous. Shame they do not offer any
discount to RAC members."
12/14/17,5,"Great service staff, very helpful. See it now was good, tech was very thorough over my vehicle. car was collected and dropped back to me within a few hours even though the collection address was wrong on the systems. highly recommend and will use banstead mini again."
12/14/17,2,Not impressed.told car needed emissions update with mot booked car in. Turned up on day then told car doesn't need update l was misled could have got mot cheaper and nearer where I live...
12/14/17,5,"I bought a car in April 17, very pleased with the experience. Just had it serviced, lovely people and good hot coffee while you wait. See you next year for second service."
12/14/17,5,"Thought my car required an oil change, Matthew checked informed me it was not, but a number of other points, namely MOT were and this was dealt with quickly and with the minimum of fuss. Very happy."
12/14/17,5,"Very good service and advice from initial visit and sighting of Velar !
Never heard or seen one, beautiful vehicle and great service from Gary from order to delivery."
12/14/17,5,Very good service. Max is a star
12/14/17,1,"Very unprofessional. Despite there was no fault in the health check and no warnings on the car, recommended and advocated full service which was essentially a bad advise.
Our car was delivered back to us on 13thDec2017 evening and we found that dashboard lights were not working. A car that was sent in a perfect order just for MOT came back with dashboard light problem.
Called Thames Ditton BMW today and still waiting for a call back to resolve the issue."
12/14/17,5,"The staff were very friendly and don’t try to pressure me into buying anything I didn’t need, free coffee and WiFi whilst I waited and they even gave the car a wash. Happy to return when required"
12/14/17,4,Good service although a little pricey but that's what you get for buying a good car. Liked the fact the car was washed and vacuumed prior to me picking it up
12/14/17,5,This was my second visit to Inchcape Mercedes Warrington. This time for a recall. Again friendly warm welcome by receptionist and then by Sandra who took my keys booked me in and provided coffee and biscuits. Lee the technician had the two recall matters dealt with professionally and I was on my way again same afternoon. Many thanks for an excellent service. Regards Colin.
12/14/17,5,"Sales Engineer, Marco Lim, was very helpful, good service, very responsible, good attitude!"
12/14/17,4,"I thought having to deal with two Salespeople was confusing as neither had the whole picture and we were passed from one to the other all the time. It took the pleasure out of buying our fabulouse new car. I did email the Business manager, Stuart Sim, with my observation/complaint but he has clearly not thought us important enough to either acknowledge my email or answer it?

Alan Lee"
12/14/17,1,I am not satisfied with the outcome of my visit to BMW Thames Ditton recently. I have been a customer of theirs for over 20 years and expected better..... I am so upset at the moment I cannot say any more
12/14/17,5,"Had the problem sorted within an hour, including a car wash."
12/14/17,5,"Excellent. Service done on time, and given advise additional work for the future for save money. Thanks"
12/14/17,3,"boot of car looked like a complete mess had to spend my time taking everything out an putting it all back where it should have been .The adjustable shelf was at an angle of 45 degrees so lots of stuff went under it.
It should have been given back to me how was given to them."
12/14/17,5,Excellent prompt service.
12/13/17,5,Excellent service and we were well looked after whilst waiting for the work to be carried out. Work completed quickly and efficiently and vehicle washed and vaccumed. Well recommended dealership.
12/13/17,3,The engineer quickly found the problem with our car and texted us a video. The service then went downhill as the service department took hours to respond to the phone call we made in response to the text. There are not enough staff to cope with the customers waiting and it makes for a very unpleasant experience.
12/13/17,5,Excellent service thank you
12/13/17,5,"Went to Mercedes Benz in Oxford looking at a second hand A180 on the forecourt, and ended up buying a new one. The service from one of the representatives, Tom, was a huge factor in this. He was informative, relaxed, and very honest when i gave him what i was looking for, helping me pick out the car best suited to me. He took the time to give me a variety of options, and was continuously very friendly. The car itself ended up being ready for me to collect early, and the overall experience was excellent. Tom is definitely a credit to the dealership."
12/13/17,5,"I was kept informed on the progress with my car, throughout the day. I was sent a video link to show what had been looked at and advice for future.
Very good service"
12/13/17,5,"Always receive top service. at Llandudno showroom. Staff extremely helpful,and ready with the offer of a cup of coffee."

12/13/17,5,Great efficient service
12/13/17,5,Car was booked in for service at 8am. On arrival i was offered coffee and biscuits while I waited for the service to be done. The car was washed and hoovered with in 1 1/2 hours with very polite service from all staff.
12/13/17,5,Perfectly happy with whole experience.
12/13/17,5,Good service delivered on time in full
12/13/17,5,Excellent service thank you.
12/13/17,5,"Friendly, efficient, competent service is what i have come to expect from this dealer and today was no exception. From the front desk greeting to service reception and the transfer car driver everyone was friendly, efficient and competent. I have used this dealer for many years. What more can I say?."
12/13/17,5,Excellent service as usual. Booked in for 2 new tyres as recommended on latest service as a job to be done in the near future but when they checked them again they were fine so didn't do the job and saved me a fortune.
12/13/17,5,"Excellent, pleasant and knowledgeable as always !"
12/13/17,5,Very helpful staff
12/13/17,5,"Always friendly and helpful staff, excellent service on my car and good follow up."
12/13/17,5,Very good service from start to finish by far the best VW garage I have been to in the 20 years I have owned VW vehicles.
12/13/17,5,"Excellent customer service. Staff understood the importance of the car being ready within the agreed timescales.

Kate Edwards looked after us, and to top it all the car was handed back after what looked like a valet clean"
12/13/17,5,Had my VW serviced for the first time with Inchscape Colchester as they are my nearest main dealer. Had no issues with them and the bill was less than quoted which is always a good thing.
12/13/17,4,"Always a good experience, booking is easy and the service team are very helpful and courteous, makes for a good overall experience. The paperwork received afterwards could be clearer as to what has been done and any recommendations. Overall satisfied with the service."
12/13/17,3,A good response to our request for a quick turnaround
12/13/17,4,"Everything went smoothly.

Service was dealt with quickly and I was able to collect the car a few hours after dropping it off."
12/13/17,5,Fast and efficient service. VW kept me updated throughout.
12/13/17,5,Usual excellent customer service and work.
12/13/17,5,"Great garage very nice staff, made to feel welcome.
p"
12/13/17,5,It’s always easy to book my car in and they always keep me updated on the progress of any work being carried out. Their price on tyres was far cheaper than any of my local tyre dealers.
12/12/17,5,World class service👍
12/12/17,4,"Had an MOT booked in for the morning which had to be postponed twice on the day which was a little inconvenient but Joanne at BMW Chelmsford was so friendly and professional and very helpful. Will definitely use BMW again, very pleased with service received."
12/12/17,1,"Booked E Class in for its first service with express servicing, done in an hour. Upon arrival I was told there was additional work needed to be done so will take a bit longer, when asked how much longer the assistant said half an hour should be enough so I gave them 1hr 40mins to be safe. Went into town for a walk rather than sitting and waiting. When I came back I carried on waiting until after about 2hours I chased up what was happening to be told it’s just being cleaned. 30 more minutes passed for the assistant to come out and say “let’s get the paperwork done”, and while doing said paperwork he dropped in “it’s not been cleaned, would you like it to?”. The answer was as you’d expect “No!” But as a sweetener he said we’ve topped up you Ad Blue for free. I’d have liked to seen them charge me for it as I never asked for it to be done. So in conclusion they lied about the times, never asked if I was happy for chargeable work to be done and I never got the express service I wanted. Not happy, will try another Merc garage next time even if I have to travel."
12/12/17,5,"Excellent service! Very prompt and professional, the Cooper BMW team at Durham kept me posted on the progress of the job and had also arranged for breakfast whilst waiting for the car to be serviced in the morning! Special thanks to Wendy and would highly recommend Cooper BMW at Durham. Many thanks"
12/12/17,3,"Parking is always a problem on site so had to abandon my car just parking it in front of others blocking them in. The girl at reception was chatting on the phone to a mate making me wait. The waiting area was freezing cold, not sure if the heating had failed. I was asked if i wanted a coffee and I said yes, sat down and waited, and waited. After 10 minutes I got my own. Not the sort of service you would expect from Mercedes. I expect if I had been buying a car things would have been different."
12/12/17,5,FROM THE START OF MY ENQUIRY TO THE CONCLUSION OF BUYING MY AUDI Q 2 AT SWINDON AUDI I WAS TREATED WITH THE UTMOST COURTESY AND RESPECT BY ALL PERSONNEL FROM TELEPHONISTS THROUGH TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. I WOULD HAVE NO HESITATION IN RECOMMENDING THIS DEALERSHIP TO ANYONE WISHING TO BUY AN AUDI . A SPECIAL WORD OF THANKS TO THE SALES EXECUTIVE WHO DEALT SO COMPETENTLY WITH MY PURCHASE.
12/12/17,5,Great service experience and special thanks to Louise who organised transport both ways and kept me in the loop throughout the day.
12/12/17,5,"Excellent service from Nathan! From the first telephone conversation to driving away I could not have asked for more.
We ended up with a great car and a great deal.
Thank you very much."
12/12/17,5,Did what was needed and on time.
12/12/17,5,"On arrival at the Jaguar dealership we were welcomed as a valued customer and given a warm welcome on such a cold and wintery day. The first service was completed in a professional way and without any problem. We were given a detailed report of the work that had been carried out and even a video showing the condition of the tyres and the braking system.
We were also advised about an option for us to purchase a three service contract that we could sign up to that would save us money on this service and the next two services. If prices increase ours doesn’t, win win situation."
12/12/17,5,Comfortable waiting area. Pleasant & helpful staff.
12/12/17,5,"Excellent service, friendly helpful reception, the work was done speedily and efficiently. Would certainly recommend MB at Derby"
12/12/17,5,"Service done on time
Professional staff and clean , bright showroom
Very satisfied"
12/12/17,5,"Had my Mini MOT’d and brake fluid changed this week. Great service from initial greeting to booking in and completion of the work.
Once the work was done I got a videoclip from the technician which was a nice touch.
Would recommend this dealer based on my experience."
12/12/17,5,The service here is always excellent.
12/12/17,5,"Apart from not being able to easily identify the way in, my experience was seamlessly good, from the initial greeting to the precise time taken which was as promised."
12/12/17,5,"The process of owning a Mini is made better by the service you get when the car needs attention.
First rate booking system and a very friendly and hands on customer approach.
It adds to the joy of owning a 'Cooper'"
12/12/17,5,"We always have our Passat serviced by Volkswagen Inchcape. Very good personal service and we entirely trust the advice given by Andy or Stewart, who are most helpful. We had a service yesterday and bought 4 new winter tyres as advised. The only concern I have is that you address any sent mail or this email to Robert Hall. My name is Rosemarie Hall. Thank you, until our next service. By the way this is our 7th Passat and the best we have ever had."
12/12/17,2,"Hello
After my car showed an error message DriveTrain I was instructed by BMW Assist to take the car to Coopers BMW my now local garage where a replacement car will be waiting through Enterprise and that BMW Coopers should be expecting me.
When I arrived at 12:10, I was greeted with not much, when I said I've come to drop my car, are you expecting me, I was told ""No, we close in 10 minutes"", when I then said I am through BMW Assist the gentlemans response was ""leave your car we will look at it on Monday now"".

At no point was there any welcome or concern. I had to promt for some paperwork and was told to write my name and number on a blank envelop. I questioned why the error message came for which I was told, its a malfunction and just happens. Its only when I said I need the car serviced the gentlemans service level was better and showed a bit more interest.

I bought 2 brand new X3's from Stephen James Bromley, and to be honest whether its service or when i come to renew the vehicles in a couple of years I shall make sure I go to Bromley instead.

Thank you"
12/12/17,5,"Very, very good, efficient service"
12/12/17,5,"I could not fault any aspect of the service provided. Arrived on time, met, was expected. Sorted within 5 mins and off for my day. I was kept informed along the way, no surprises or worries and picked up a sparkling, serviced and ready to go car in just a few minutes. Given the weather was foul it is tremendous testament to the staff at VW Twickenham."
12/12/17,1,"Very Poor service, car left in a state, contents of my boot turned upside down, screwed up paper left in the back, wont be returning for the next service, service was on par with what I would expect from Halfords or Kwick Fit"
12/12/17,5,"Just had MOT at Cooper Banstead.
Very pleased with service, staff very friendly and helpful.
Car was cleaned as well, which is great this time of year."
12/12/17,5,"As usual, I received prompt and courteous attention when delivering my vehicle. The agreed work was checked through and I was supplied with an almost new and very clean courtesy car. During the day I was updated by email and a video on the progress of the inspection service, agreed further work to be done. The car was ready for collection at the agreed time and my car had received an excellent clean and vacuum. Thank you."
12/12/17,5,I have been using Inchcape Southport for the last 6 years and have always been impressed by their excellent customer and technical service. The service and MOT just completed matched their usual highly professional standards. As long as I own a Mercedes I’ll continue using Inchape Southport.
12/12/17,5,"The service I’ve received from this dealership in my whole driving career has been the best by far. very friendly and helpful staff, would strongly recommend this dealership to anyone and everyone."
12/12/17,5,Easy to drop off and they performed the MOT very quickly (it passed!) and the free clean was very much appreciated. Very polite and efficient service from all those I had contact with.
12/12/17,5,"Recently purchased a m sport 2 series from Cooper Thames Ditton, a massive thank you to Sam Moth and Ashley from servicing for going above and beyond to find me the perfect car, great communication and amazing customer service"
12/12/17,5,"We bought our new Golf R from Inchcape Romford Volkswagen a year ago and it was due for its first free oil change, which I took back to Romford. I chose to stay in the VW centre whilst the service took place, where there was free tea/coffee to help myself to. The service was completed in under 2 hours and included a free health check inspection as well as a courtesy car wash and hoover. My service advisor, Wayne Franklin, was attentive from first arrival to when I left, advising me when the oil change had been completed as well as when the car was being washed. Wayne was also happy to answer any questions I asked. As part of the service, the service engineer, Kevin Franklin, sent a video of the health check to me once completed there and then. I cannot fault Inchcape Romford Volkswagen for their attention to detail and the service level was outstanding. I would highly recommend them."
12/12/17,5,"fantastic service as always.

Michael Clement was great to deal with and a credit to the business, ill be back in another 20k miles.

thank you"
12/12/17,5,Extremely efficient and helpful staff and service.
12/12/17,4,"As always the servicing here is very good.
Records of past services and work all in order and generally the car is ready at the time agreed.
Staff are professional and well informed.
I can always rely on a good result."
12/12/17,4,"Car service handled very professionally and courteously from collection through to delivery of a serviced, clean car."
12/12/17,5,"Booked my A4 in for service and MOT. Audi rang back to say service wasn’t due for another 9,000 miles due to flexi service ( get in)! But that wasn’t all. Car passed MOT. Couple of advisories, and NO CHARGE as I had recently had cam belt fitted. They also gave it a good valet and gave me a courtesy car. So didn’t cost me a penny (deffo is a Father Christmas and his name is Phil). Audi were Totally honest about service and I know car is good to go to go as Audi main agent did MOT. How’s that for a Christmas present. (Phil was brill )."
12/11/17,5,"I seldom relished dealing with some of Car salespeople I have met in the past but dealing with Carl Port has been a pleasure. He listened and understood what I wanted, made me aware of additional ‘extras’ I could buy but did over-push these (which would have hacked me off!!)
I have only had the car for a few days but it seems to be in great condition.
So far this has been an excellent experience."
12/11/17,5,"Emma was brilliant. Professional and friendly team, excellent customer service would highly recommend. Love my new mini!!!"
12/11/17,5,"Very good service once again, loan car supplied as requested, my Mini washed and cleaned awaiting my collection. GREAT SERVICE."
12/11/17,5,Great service by Jake
12/11/17,5,Lee Evans is a very good and helpful salesman!
12/11/17,5,You will never be disappointed. Professionalism and the personal touch always.
12/11/17,4,The Service Manager looked after me well and so did the receptionists
12/11/17,5,The service was great.
12/11/17,5,"So happy with my new Mini. Carl was perfect, he certainly knows the Mini so could answer any question but was also not too pushy.
Dont think I will be purchasing a car from anywhere else from now on"
12/11/17,5,I would not hesitate to recommend Cooper Durham Mini to any one. I received excellent customer service from Ellie and her colleagues when purchasing a new mini. A*.
12/11/17,5,"Amazing service as always, Stockport Audi went adove and beyond to ensure that I had the best deal and car on the market to match my needs, just couldn't fault them."
12/11/17,1,"So far, not good!
My driver side wiper got out of sync while driving in snow yesterday. I stopped, and proceeded to reset the arms, when I discovered that the probable cause for this was because of a loose nut on the wiper arm (required about 3 turns, by hand, to remove it completely from the bolt). I removed the arm completely, allowed the wipers to run then placed the arm back on and tightened the nut. (I noticed that the inside of the arm where it connects to the wiper motor appeared stripped, likely as a result of the nut having been loose and the extra loading of snow and ice causing it to work against additional load). The wipers now appeared to be working fine, and I continued driving back home. I drove for about another 3 miles when the passenger wiper went awry and then both wipers stopped working.
I have now been told that this will not be repaired under warranty. The implication being that I had caused this fault which I completely disagree with. Had the nut been tightened properly this would not have happened. Given that the car was serviced less than two months ago, and unless it is the expectation that I should do my own inspecting to ensure all bolts are properly fastened, in which case i wonder why I'm paying for a service contract, i would expect this to be repaired under warranty.
After voicing my disagreement, I was invited to see Paul, the service manager, who tried to suggest that I hadn't cleared the snow away and that would have caused the damage, despite my telling him very clearly that I had been driving for possibly about 15 miles by the time this wiper went out of sync. After a debate with Paul, in which I made it clear that I do not accept responsibility for the breakdown, he has offered to do the repair under warranty, with the caveat that if the warranty department rejects it I pay for the repairs.
In order to move forward I'll accept that as an interim solution. However I need to make it clear that I do not accept responsibility for this defect, and I would like this resolved asap without me having to pay for repairs on something that should not have happened in the first place.
I expect, having chosen Mercedes, after 13 years of driving a Lexus without any problems, that I would have even less problems. For the past month+ since my car has been serviced I've had more problems with the car than I had in 13 years of using my Lexus. This is not what I expect from a car that's supposed to be one of the best engineered in the world.
So I ask that you make this problem go away asap without further waste of my time and without further inconvenience to me.
Kindest regards
Harry"
12/11/17,5,"I had a great experience dealing with your Cooper Teesside branch.
I would like to highlight the great attitude of the sales representative, Suffyane, who was very supportive, patient and professional in providing all the information I was after.
I had to get the deal done through the phone as I was travelling from Scotland.
Suffyane managed to get all the paper work sorted and the car was in magnificent shape, ready for collection when I arrived.
BMW Teesside have exceed my expectations and managed to make the whole sale a pleasant experience.
Thanks for all that.
Regards
Alaa"
12/11/17,5,"Always an easy transaction at Cooper York, wether it's buying a new car or booking in for a service.
Pleasant and professional service everytime, thank you Garry Turgoose. Hand over for new vehicle was straight forward..just loads of paperwork to sign!"
12/11/17,5,While you wait service of brake fluid change completed on time along with a clean of the car - what’s not to like!!
12/11/17,5,"1st Class service, all members of staff very polite and friendly, with special thanks to Robyn in service who looked after me from start to finish. This was my first visit, and I would highly recommend and will be returning.
.Thanks again"
12/11/17,5,"Excellent service and with a smile, no request is too much hassle for them."
12/11/17,5,"Every member of staff I interacted with during my visit were polite, friendly and professional. Amy, from the parts department was particularly helpful."
12/11/17,5,"Very good, very efficient"
12/11/17,5,Excellent service all round by Lexus Guildford service department. I do not want to mention names as I need to take into account data protection. Staff are friendly and always helpful. Honest and never cut corners. Best Lexus dealership ever.
12/11/17,4,Had a long wait to be seen both at the start - when I took my car in and when I returned. Also a water mark on my seat on the driver’s side- not sure what happened there
12/11/17,4,"I would have awarded 5 stars except despite arriving on time and booking in with showroom reception staff (as advised), the waiting time to be assisted by service staff was longer than expected, particularly when I arrived to collect my vehicle. I was waited for 20 minutes without contact. I returned to reception to enquire how much longer I would have to wait and discovered that the service staff had not been informed by reception staff of my arrival. Disappointing!

However the service itself and the information provided, plus the use of the loan car, were all very good."
12/11/17,5,Very good service as always.
12/11/17,5,"Experience was excellent from start to finish! Car went in for a recall, courtesy car provided, customer service was amazing! Even to the point where my son was hovering around an i8 and one of the members of staff came over and unlocked it to let him have a sit in it, and was more than happy to talk to me about cars even though I wasn’t there to buy a car! Another salesman was really nice and was speaking to me about cars, I think his name was Tom, he was 21. Thank you BMW"
12/11/17,5,Very good value and helpful staff
12/11/17,4,"Really very helpful and I would use them again. The only reason for not 5 stars is that I think it is very expensive. But I suppose it is Audi.
Shame though. Makes me think about whether I would buy another Audi."
12/11/17,5,Professional and friendly
12/11/17,3,"Definitely felt like a second class customer taking my wifes car for its MOT and winter check. It was only a Smart car !! Staff wander around looking lost and although look at you, they don't approach. Think they need some training in customer service !! We had pre-arranged to test drive a newer Smart but told when we got there it wasn't available. The sales person who was supposed to have arranged it, wouldn't be there as it was his day off ???? Surprise surprise when we saw him there dealing with someone else ! Not good customer service. Bought my Smart car from Blackpool which was an excellent Mercedes garage !"
12/11/17,1,"Shocking experience, I took my car for a service last week I ended up getting a phone call telling me someone had driven into the back of my car, no apology was given! To make matters worse, I have to do all the chasing around to get my car book my car back in to get it fixed! I am shocked at the lack of customer service I hav recieved, I would have thought Mercedes would have atleast offered an apology to me as a minimal level or respect. I am not happy at all!!"
12/10/17,5,Service at the reception was excellent. Person who came to collect the keys was very polite and explained in detail what work he going to carry out. I was informed by telephone as soon as car was ready for collection.
12/10/17,5,We experienced a fantastic customer service experience courtesy of Jason Young. Jason was extremely helpful throughout the whole process and really understood our requirements.
12/10/17,4,GOOD SERVICE BUT A LITTLE PRICEY DUE TO LABOUR CHARGE
12/9/17,4,very pleased with the service provided
12/9/17,5,Efficient Service
12/9/17,5,Service was excellent.
12/8/17,5,Efficient service. Polite and attentive staff
12/8/17,5,"H A Fox really pushed the boat out. Service booking was confirmed by text, voice mail and email. On the day I was welcomed, offered tea or coffee and staff went through what was to be done. Later in day phone call to say car would be ready. Car came back cleaned inside and out - it was just like picking the car up for the first time. If this is the standard of service
that Jaguar and its dealers provide then I know I bought the right car through the right dealership."
12/8/17,5,"Mercedes Warrington ,
Staff always very helpful , very informative about work to be carried out on car .
This is our 6 or 7 Mercedes we have had from this garage

12/8/17,5,Excellent friendly service with complimentary collection / delivery and valet service. 😊
12/8/17,5,Excellent service. Friendly staff. Can’t fault them in any way. Looked after from start to finish
12/8/17,4,"Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because it was really hard for me to reach the service advisor, I've had to call multiple times.
Other than that, brilliant service. In my case, they gave me a free lift home and back to the dealer, and they've video the vehicle health check, really useful feature."
12/8/17,5,Took my BMW one series to Coopers Chelmsford for oil and filter change. Booked to wait. When I booked it in the girl on the service desk was really helpful. Left my car. Then went into Chelmsford for lunch. It took a couple of hours. When I went to pick it up it was all done. The car had been cleaned into and out looked like new again. Collecting the car was good went to the service desk the paperwork was don't just had to pay. Although it was a little bit dearer than I would have paid in a local garage. I had more confidence using a main dealer. The staff at Coopers Chelmsford are always polite and very helpful. My car was parked by the door so paid then off I went. A totally seamless service. I'm a very happy customer.
12/8/17,5,"I have nothing but praise for this company.
Excellent service and very enjoyable experience."

12/8/17,5,Great service support
12/8/17,5,"g
Given a time slot for my visit so that I could wait for completion. Comfy seating in waiting area with a tv tuned to sky sports news and a complementary coffee. I will go again."
12/8/17,5,"Booking arrangements, courtesy car, service attention and timings were all very good,"
12/8/17,5,"Pleasant visit as usual at this BMW main dealership. Never disappointed, all the staff friendly and efficient showing that as a customer you are important to them. Work completed in timely fashion and courtesy wash and vacuum always welcome, even if it does start raining as you leave !! You get what you pay for at Cooper BMW in Chelmsford, efficient, friendly and professional service."
12/8/17,2,"Pleasant people trying to provide good customer service but let down by a lack of organisation.
- Phone calls not returned (phoned at 1pm left a message, called again at 2.30pm to call me back, again at 3pm and again at 3.30pm to be told my service agent has left for the afternoon - someone else did call be back 20 mins later).
- waiting around 20 mins while me vehicle is found(!) and brought round
- no feedback on two issues I'd asked them to look into"
12/8/17,5,"Excellent service from a great team, myself & my husband have been customers for a long time and the service from all the staff is always friendly and professional."
12/8/17,4,Very quick response to my enquiry. Had to wait little while for tyre to be changed. Think considering I bought vehicle from Cooper BMW with tyres on they would have replaced with the same make. Would have preferred all my tyres to have been the same.
12/8/17,5,As always the best in the business
12/8/17,5,Brilliant customer service from the beginning to the end. Well done Steve and billy for your professionalism. Always satisfied with the work carried out. 👏👏👍
12/8/17,1,"I was disappointed to find that some of the areas I had asked Mercedes to look in to whilst they serviced the car was not dealt with. This resulted in my key not working in the morning and unable to lock or open my car. I can understand some things could get missed but the fact I highlighted this as a key point when booking the car in, also when the person came to collect the vehicle and also emailing the service manager whilst the car was in the workshop demonstrates a lack of professional service. This is the first time I have used Loughborough and frankly I don't think I will use them again after this poor experience."
12/8/17,5,Excellent customer service from start to finish
12/8/17,1,"Very good experience as usual from the ladies on the desk to Pail Wilkes who looked after me at the garage
Kept up to date on the service at all times

12/8/17,5,Wonderful service and customer care and kept me informed of when my car was ready to be picked back up again love the video they send you showing the underneath of the car and the work that was carried out
12/8/17,5,"I found the Chester Inchcape staff, including Naomi Wynn, very helpful and professional"
12/8/17,4,"Had an appointment at Mercedes-Benz of Nottingham for 'Recall' work regarding fitting of additional fuse to protect the Starter Motor. My appointment was for 15:00hrs, however I arrived at around 14:45hrs and only had to wait 5 minutes to be attended to. By 15:25hrs I was driving away - it would have been 10 minutes earlier had I not been blocked in by a 'Service' owned car completely indiscriminately parked with not a thought for their customers. I had to go back to reception and it took them a while to get it removed - hence 4 stars for this visit, otherwise it's fair to say that this was a very reasonable experience."
12/8/17,2,Service & MOT meant to take c2hrs. After 2hrs 10mins was told due to a ramp not working(at a large relatively new VW branch!) the MOT hadn’t been done so I had to wait another hour. But a very good service desk manager did an excellent job at ameliorating the situation!
12/8/17,5,"I had one or two issues with this dealership when they were located in Chester but in full credit to them they have bent over backwards to make things right. They have since moved to a fantastic new showroom, employ staff that are a pleasure to deal with and where nothing is too much trouble. Well done to all the team."
12/8/17,5,"Brilliant service. All staff are helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Showroom is clean and welcoming, full of cars we would like to own!!"
12/8/17,3,"Booked a service, told the adviser I needed new tyres and some other non standard work doing and could I schedule it all in at the same time. Was told no problem, we’ll book the service and sort out extra stuff when you come in. Came in for my appointment - 7 mins late because of traffic and I seemed to have missed my slot as I waited 40 mins to be seen. 4 other people came after me and were seen first. Then I was told the extra work I spoke about wasn’t booked or scheduled and they had meant they’d take a look and quote for it but not do it. The parts desk guy thiiygh was brilliant, did the tyres anyway, matched prices and even gave me a little money off because of so much work at once, but I did have to make an extra appointment and come back for more work. Parts guy was excellent, and very good work and prices, but basic customer interaction not what I expected from Audi."
12/7/17,5,Great service once again from Cooper Teesside. Thanks to Oliver in Sales for a great job
12/7/17,5,We were very happy with the service provided.
12/7/17,1,"You would think what with Volkswagen's reputation in general being in the gutter over the last couple of years that they would be doing all they could to restore customer confidence and a bit of trust. Well you thought wrong, I have been going to the VW dealer in Southend for service and repair work every year for 14 years but that as I found out counts for absolutely nothing. After a failed attempt to get the car serviced by them three days before (I dropped the car off and was called an hour later to say they didn't have the right oil filter) Inchape agreed to come and pick the car up from my home address to have a second go at it.

The minor service was done and they dropped it back, I was at work but the advisor Emily called and said that whilst a few things needed doing it was nothing urgent and I could book the car in again in a few months. Next morning I start the car for the first time after the service and its running like a tank and the engine management light is on. To be clear when they took the car there was no sign of the management light. I called the dealer for an explanation and was told I would be called by the service manager. I waited four hours for the call but he obviously could not be bothered so I called again. This time the receptionist was making more excuses so I asked to speak to the dealer principal (DP).

I was put through to him and proceeded to go through the problems. The DP said leave it with him and he would investigate and call me back. He called back within 15 minutes and immediately tried to say that the car was brought into the dealership with the engine management light on. He also said I was told about this by Emily but had declined the work.

I explained that at no time during our discussion did Emily inform me the engine management light was on. I reiterated what was discussed and that nothing with the car was highlighted as urgent by Emily. The DP refused to accept this. I asked if calls were recorded and he said yes, I then asked him to listen to my call with Emily and I also asked for a copy of the recording myself. After 30 minutes the DP comes back and his story regarding the call recording being available had changed. He said that whilst calls are normally recorded for some reason mine wasn't. How convenient, so basically on the back of this he refused to accept my sequence of events.

I said again that I couldn't quite believe they dropped the car back running like it was and I was also worried them driving it back this way may have damaged the engine. As silly as it may sound I have a lot of sentimental attachment to the car and I would never not agree to the work being carried out if they had explained it was running so badly. The most annoying thing was the car was running fine before Inchape picked it up and dropped it off.

The only offer on the table from the DP was for me now to drop the car off at some point but not at weekend because this was not convenient for him. There was no offer to pick the car up or any other assistance despite the way it was returned and my concerns about the engine being potentially damaged if I drove it with the engine management light on. Unbelievable.

So there you go a customer for over fourteen years and treated with utter contempt by this dealer. Literally the only place where you get the car back from a service with it running 100 times worse than before.

To say I am disgusted is an understatement and I will never go back. I have lost complete faith in VW as a brand and this dishonest dealer. They have a management team who try and lie there way out of a situation in an attempt to cover staff errors. Their way of dealing with complaints is to attempt to shift all blame back on the consumer. So there you have it, VW and Inchape Southend basically a brand with no moral compass whatsoever."
12/7/17,5,"Staff were pleasant, courteous and explained the service. Car valeted on return
Booking system allowed me to arrange the service around work commitments.
Drive took me to work as requested again pleasant and helpful."
12/7/17,5,Excellent service today. Love the update videos the service engineer sends.
12/7/17,1,Why do you replace tyres on my car and not properly reset the running flat indicator - especially when my wife brought the car to you and she is not technically profient to deal with all of the warning lights that appeared on the dash within the first 30 minutes of her trip! Another unfavourable experience for me with your garage!! You must do better!!
12/7/17,3,"My wife drives this car more than I It had a bad noise on full lock in reverse and a noisy front drivers seat. Both faults could not be found by Nottingham technicians but they found four new tyres were needed this after only 13,500 miles from new.This is totally unacceptable mileage we have had 9 new Mercedes over the years and mostly had 22000 miles from the front tyres and 30000 miles out of the rear. The make of tyres fitted was continental and I can only conclude they did the best deal on new cars for Mercedes but the worst deal for customers. The new tyres took 3 days to locate and fit. Adam who looked after us did a great job we had a car for this time. The faults we reported when we took the car in were suddenly able to be found by the Nottingham technicians and fixed but I worry we were not believed to start with."
12/7/17,5,"Excellent service from booking through to dropping car off and collection at the end. I would definitely recommend Crawley Audi.

12/7/17,5,"Quoted the incorrect cheaper price for my service but was quite happy to honour it.
Thank you"
12/7/17,5,"Helpful and friendly salesperson Darryl, who made me feel relaxed test driving my Mini and made the whole experience of buying a Mini fun."
12/7/17,5,"In simple terms, the reasons I choose Inchcape, Manchester :
Ease of booking my car in for service/repairs.
Polite and welcoming receptionist (apologises as I can't remember her name)
Sarah Lawford (Service Dept) provides excellent customer service. She was prompt, polite and kept me fully informed of the status of my vehicle.

As my review title states, the service provided is one of the factors I've ordered another VW.
Keep up the good work Inchcape"
12/7/17,5,"Excellent service, sales rep listened to what I was looking for and delivered a car tailored to my needs. Would use again."
12/7/17,5,"All aspects of this service were carried out impeccably, from the initial booking to the delivery of my beautifully valeted car after being collected for service. I cannot fault Inchcape of Swindon."
12/7/17,5,Excellent service from the team.
12/7/17,5,"Great service from professional efficient staff, especially Gary Steeles, the salesman. Clean comfortable waiting area for customers with excellent coffee."
12/7/17,5,"Excellent customer service, would recommend to anyone"
12/7/17,5,Amy handled my MOT & winter check very well was kept well informed car was ready when agreed
12/7/17,5,"I bought my new discovery sport just over a year ago. This was with some trepidation after a disaster of a Freelander in the early 2000's,although an earlier one was excellent.
The service at that time was very poor and it took me 14 years to reconsider the brand. The dealership from sales to service via reception has been excellent,and a transformed experience I must say. The car is fine ,perform's well with only some suspicion over Land Rover electronics. I am not a car lover at all,but I enjoy driving this still,after over 14 months of use."
12/7/17,5,"Great customer service and care and provided call backs when requested, went above and beyond in regards to looking into other questions about the car raised by myself that would not ordinarily be covered in the service"
12/7/17,5,Excellent service all round.
12/7/17,5,"Great service - from the booking, right through to the collection of the vehicle. A courtesy vehicle was reserved at the time of booking and such was the attention to detail, it was an automatic to match my own vehicle.
The service and minor warranty jobs were carried out efficiently and to my complete satisfaction. The car was ready for collection at the requested time and looked immaculate after a thorough valet.
The service adviser kept me fully informed about the progress of the work in the workshop and even sent a small video clip containing comments by the technician working on my vehicle. When returning home, I had one or two queries about the service record and these were very efficiently dealt with by the adviser by email. An excellent dealership and one I have been pleased to use for over fifteen years."
12/7/17,5,Excellent customer service.
12/7/17,5,Helpful friendly staff and my car was serviced within the time specified including a valet and full report.
12/7/17,5,Great individual service. Tracy was brill
12/7/17,5,"I cannot praise the BMW Durham highly enough following my visit yesterday. After a pretty stressful start to the day, (all my fault incidentally!),
the staff were very considerate, professional and helpful. The best 'garage'
experience i've had to date!"
12/7/17,5,"Excellent service and helpful friendly staff. Arrived from Devon to purchase Is 250 F SPORT. Peter and Danny talked us through the purchase and finance process over the phone ,Danny picked us up from train station, lent us his car and recommended a suitable hostelry for a relaxed lunch whilst the paperwork was processed. Patiently ran through all the controls and set up the Bluetooth and phone links.
Smooth transaction with our chosen car presented fully valeted with a complementary full tank of fuel and three days insurance to boot.
Highly recommended.
Special thanks to Danny and we hope you recover from your hip surgery soon.
