3/18/17,5,"We approached Inchcape by phone contact, everyone was most helpful and we were kept up to date at all times regarding the purchase and collection of our new car. Our sales person was helpful, answering any queries and questions that we asked. When we collected our car, everything was in place and we were treated and made to feel most welcome."
3/18/17,5,"This is my third new vehicle purchased from Inchcape Colchester. On every purchase we have been more than pleased with the service from start to finish. The sales staff have never pushed us into deals we do not want or are not sure about. The sales team are professional, friendly , knowledgeable and extremely helpful at all times. Nothing is too much trouble and they always provide me with an answer to a question I may have without chasing them. The other thing worth a mention is they always are available to take a call. If not they call back very shortly afterwards.
The reception team, either by personal visit or by telephone are polite and extremely helpful whenever I contact them. A good honest team always on hand to help you make a purchase and remain helpful throughout and provide excellent after care as well.
To sum up this review;
I will have no hesitation in going back to Inchcape Colchester to purchase my next car."
3/18/17,5,"The salesman was very helpful and honest. Showed me all over my choice of car and answered all my questions. Had a very good test drive too.
Sorted the paperwork effeciently and we arranged a mutual day and time for pick up. All paperwork in place just the bill to pay!!
Loved the car being wrapped up and the video, brilliant.
Car is great and I love doing it."
3/18/17,1,"I found a 2 year old Audi A3 on the Tetbury website which I was interested in. I contacted the salesman on the 12th & he said the car had just arrived at the garage; so he would take a video & send it to me & the car would be put through the workshop. The salesman contacted me on the 14th & sent me a copy of the ""approved used check"" sheet. I said I was very interested in the vehicle. He said he had 2 days holiday & we could finalise things when he came back on the 17th. I called him on the morning of the 17th to fine tune the deal i.e. Would the price include alloy wheel & tyre protection, dents/scratches insurance etc. He said he would call me back before lunch. He didn't; so I called him again, late afternoon, & was told he was busy but would call me back. He called me back at 1840 to tell me that the car had been sold. It had been sold a week earlier & should not have come to their garage & should not have appeared on their web site.
What a shambles. Are they really an Audi approved garage ? My experience was a complete disaster"
3/18/17,5,"Bought my new Tiguan at this dealership. Had been offered a great discount through carwow , so now haggling , also had some extras thrown in too.
Really great handover of our new car , which made it a special day!"
3/18/17,5,Very helpful service by the sales person who made a big effort to ensure we knew everything we needed and that we got what we wanted
3/18/17,5,"I have just bought a car from Inchcape VW Shrewsbury. All Staff were friendly and helpful. Our Salesman was patient, knowledgable and definitely 'not pushy'. He listened to our requirements and then found a car which met all those requirements. He followed this up with a phone call after our purchase to ensure we were happy with the car and enquire if we had any further questions regarding the car. I would certainly recommend this company and their staff. Well done VW Inchcape."
3/18/17,5,"After being treated with disdain by my local Glasgow Audi, I was put in touch with Cheshire Oaks Audi through an online broker. The difference was night and day. I was treated as I expected to be treated by a brand like Audi. Amy Bagley was fantastic from start to finish. I got a good deal for a great car, she helped to get the finance sorted so that when I travelled down from Glasgow to pick up the car, there were only a few things left to do before I could drive away in my new car. I received a superb level of service and will happily recommend Cheshire Oaks Audi to my friends, even though it would mean travelling down from Glasgow. It would be worth it. Thanks again to Amy"
3/18/17,5,"I would definitely recommend Audi Macclesfield, everyone was very helpful in my making a decision for my new car. The whole process of changing my car was made very easy and hassle free. Thank you to Jonathan for helping me."
3/18/17,5,Great service. Knew exactly what I wanted and didn't try to sell me anything else other than that. Friendly people. Efficient service.
3/17/17,5,"We went with no appointment, but a salesman still sore us even though they were all booked up as there was a special event on. We found a car in the showroom that I loved only to find that it had been sold and the colour had been discontinued, the salesman gave us a car to take out on a test drive and said while we were gone he would get on the phone and see what he could do. When we got back we were told that they had found one. We picked up our new car today and would like to say thanks to Alex T. for going the extra mile for us. Would recommend them to any one"
3/17/17,5,"After a poor experience at durham bmw i was told to try the Teeside showroom by family and friends,the difference was like night and day.
Me and my wife were greeted warmly on arrival and all the staff smiled and spoke,after listening to our needs and questions a deal was soon in place which beat the other dealership hands down,how two showrooms for the same company can be so different is amazing.
Cooper bmw Teeside is first class from start to finish and Nathan who we dealt with was an absolute star and a real credit to you,when we are due to change vehicles there is only one place we will be going."
3/17/17,5,"Replacement rear light fitted while I waited. Booking a slot was easy. Staff were helpful, courteous and professional."
3/17/17,5,"Five star service from Audi Canterbury and a big thanks to Ben hodges for his first class service
And the way he conducted the purchase of my new car thanks a lot Audi Canterbury,and the coffee
Was great to regards g Clarke"
3/17/17,5,"Excellent customer service, all of the staff were polite and professional. Thank you to Mr Stuart Wolfendale for your help during the selection and purchase of my new vehicle."
3/17/17,5,"Inchcape Volkswagen Bromborough Wirral have yet again delivered excellent after sales service. My Golf required had an intermittent fault about twice a week the alarm would start after driving approx 200yds. The fault was diagnosed as the key needed replacing. New keys were ordered and programmed. I was kept informed throughout the process.
I have been using this dealership for 9 years and have never been let down or disappointed with service I have received."
3/17/17,5,"I was initially impressed by the honest and no-nonsense approach of the sales executive, Carl. The VW garage was 125 miles away so I had to be very sure about the car. Carl's communication system was excellent: phone calls, emails and short videos; all very clear and no sales pressure.
When I eventually went to pick up the car and complete the deal I was very impressed with the organisation, the smoothness and the efficient manner in which it happened. I was more than happy with the experience when I drove away in my brand new Golf. Cheers Carl and Inchscape. J."
3/17/17,5,"Very happy with the approach, service and deal!"
3/17/17,5,"There is opinion that main agents charge well over the odds and don't give much of a service. NOT TRUE for VW Inchcape at Eastwood.
They have had problems in the past but are now excellent! It is the people who are there that make the firm and currently they work very well as a team from the intial 'phone call going through to the correct person, if there is a delay then they offer to 'phone back - and actually do so. The technicians come to reception if needed and they are very well VW trained. Yes the main agent is going to cost more than a small workshop as training and updating has to be cost included.
End result has been very good so far - just hope it carries on at the excellent level. Very 'team' orinated."
3/17/17,4,"Good experience re the purchase - no problem, e.g., no friction, no hassle.
One criticism is that we found the customers' waiting area is too cramped - at least for our liking, i.e., we found ourselves rubbing shoulders and elbows with other Inchcape VW Southend-on-Sea-ers (that is, when some weren't busy stashing the complimentary cans of fizzy drinks in their handbags!)"
3/17/17,5,"I found that having my Discovery serviced at Hunters Land Rover was so easy, and courteous, and good value and service."
3/17/17,5,"Everything was done very quickly and very efficiently. Extremely happy with the service I've received up until now and a big thank you to Tom at Stockport for everything. Top man despite the football team!

Ryan Towers"
3/17/17,5,The transaction could not have been smoother. Excellent knowledgeable staff.
3/17/17,5,All very professional
3/17/17,5,"We were very satisfied with our visit to Inchape Shrewsbury, as usual it was 100% successful."
3/17/17,5,"Ricky Forrest dealt with my purchase from start to finish he was very professional , courteous and helpful nothing was a problem for him . Was made to feel welcome on arrival by the girls on reception as well . Really appreciated the video message when my car arrived and the personal unveiling of it on collection . Great experience will be seeing you all again when I purchase my next Audi"
3/17/17,5,"Felt very welcome, wasn't smothered and put under any unnecessary pressure. The service I recieved from Tom Matten was first class and nothing was too much trouble, he went above and beyond and I was impressed with his in depth and technical knowledge of Audi. I drove away in the perfect car for me and my family."
3/17/17,5,"From the first call to collection the service was second to none.
It's the first time a company has updated me with progress before I had a chance to chase them. I hope that the service team are as efficient as the sales team."
3/17/17,5,Very Professional service !!!
3/17/17,4,"The service I received was great, and communication was also brill.

Obviously it could have been cheaper, but then that will always be an issue!"
3/17/17,5,"FROM THE ORIGINAL SALES PERSON, THROUGH HANDOVER (DUE TO MATERNITY LEAVE) AND FROM MY PART-EX COLLECTION TO DELIVERY OF MY NEW VEHICLE EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE THROUGHOUT. ALL PERSONS ARE AN ASSEST TO THE BRAND EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS."
3/17/17,5,Great customer service and friendly attitude. Keep up the good work.
3/17/17,5,The staff were very good indeed. The showroom staff were extremely welcoming and the sales staff were extremely helpful. Our test drives were arranged with no fuss and the discount offered was very competitive. Hand over of the car was slick and very professional with all aspects of the car and after care serviced explained clearly. The team at Lexus Guildford are a credit to the brand - all the old horror stories about car sales establishments were banished. A great service and enjoyable experience. Well done to everyone involved.
3/17/17,5,Needed the fuel tank replaced urgently and they stepped up to the mark and did it the time needed. Thanks Inchscape Chelmesford.
3/16/17,5,"excellent customer service
as with all these sites I cannot comment on the car service as I was neither watching over the mechanic nor have I a clue about car engines however the service I got as a customer was super excellent!!!!"
3/16/17,5,Transaction went smoothly they did everything they said they would.
3/16/17,5,"I saw the car we were after on the Audi approved website and contacted Macclesfield Audi , I was put through to the salesman Adrian ball and he dealt with our test drive and purchase of our approved Audi A4 Allroad from start to Finish .. He couldn't have been more helpful or knowledgeable with our questions we put to him and things we wanted doing to the car before we arrived to purchase the car. We drove away in our approved Audi with the confidence and peace of mind that we were buying a car and service we could trust and we very happy with Macclesfield Audi and Adrians help and service through out ...."
3/16/17,5,"The service I received was excellent, I was kept informed, dealt with very politely and could discuss any issues. Items were covered within the annual service package."
3/16/17,5,The staffed gave me a quote fetched the car retuned it clean ...Perfect
3/16/17,5,"I have just bought an Audi A1 from Inchcape Audi in Ellesmere Port and can honestly say the experience was excellent from start to finish I was made to feel very welcome, all my questions were answered quickly and fully giving me great confidence that the salesman (Ian Earle) knew what he was talking about. I would highly recommend this dealership if you are in the market for an Audi. And if you are not, why not, they are excellent cars :o)"
3/16/17,5,"As always at Gilbert Lawton, the work on my car was carried out to a high standard, and within a specified time frame."
3/16/17,5,"Derby staff could not have been more accommodating in helping me choose and purchase my 'new' car within my price rage. Very satisfied -
and thank you."
3/16/17,5,Good service with prompt delivery
3/16/17,5,Had a minor issue with my new Prius. The alarm would go off for no reason. Inchcape got the sensor in quickly and replaced it under warranty. The service was very efficient and the staff extremely pleasant.
3/16/17,4,"Because my car's info is held electronically with this dealership they were not only able to do the Toyota recalls but also note the car was overdue on its service record.

It was an unexpected extra to be emailed a film explaining the work undertaken"
3/15/17,5,rang made appointment for service and recall. quoted price for service all done and recall work.Some additional work required under warranty (oil leaks). Car rebooked for 1 week later all sorted and courtesy car. Price quoted was correct kept informed by email/ text and video of service/ repairs required . I WOULDNT HESITATE TO TAKE MY CAR HERE!
3/15/17,1,"Having had some recall work done, my 2 front tyres show feathering on both the inner/outer rim which put them into the amber colour, and would I like to have them changed when I question the fact that I had only had the vehicle since December, another person came out and said the tyres are in the green and it's down to chip and chunk, vehicle being driven on rough gravel or aggressive road surfaces the vehicle has only been used on motorways and A class roads we have only done 2500 miles.the document I have on this states version has been issued for a change to the affected vehicle range and the Markets this would suggest that Land rover know they have a problem with tyres on these vehicles and are using it as an excuse because they will say the tyres are fine. Having received a video pointing out the feathering and advising the tyres are checked I booked in at STS pro tyres to be told the tyres at 12000 miles are I need of changing but they couldn't understand why the rear tyres where as good as the day they went on. I was told someone would phone me on the 14th no call, I rang on the 15th to be told the person was with a customer and would phone me when free still no call. For a company with a core strategy to put customers first it certainly doesn't. I have a Discovery sport HSE. I sent a mail to Hunters Kings Lynn last night had a reply telling me they would contact me within 2 hours of business hours opening guess what still no phone call at 10:55 this has to be the poorest customer service I have ever received seems they are quite happy to take thousands of pounds from you and them ignore you when issues arise. Should have probably brought a merc instead would have been treated a lot better than this. Would now rate with no stars if available"
3/15/17,5,Excellent customer Service
3/15/17,1,"I went to Inchcape Cheshire Oaks Audi to view a used car. I was enticed by their website that said that offers can be made on used cars. I made an appointment with a sales rep and went to view the car I saw on their website.
The car still needed preparation work as it had dents, scratches and was dirty. I looked past this as the sales rep said the car would be in showroom condition after it had been valeted and prepped.
So I decided to make an offer for the car, the sales rep then went to talk to his manager. The sales manager who was the most arrogant and egotist sales man I’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting said that offers aren’t accepted on used cars. Thus no discounts are ever given. I pointed out that it clearly says on the Inchcape Cheshire Oaks Audi website that offers can be made on used cars. At which point he said that the website was wrong and needed changing. - False advertising by the Cheshire Oaks dealership to get customers through the door.
In total I spent 2 hours driving to the dealership and another 1.5 hours with the sales rep. The only reason I went to the dealership was because it clearly states on their website that offers can be made on used cars.
A complaint was made to the Head of Business of the Cheshire Oaks dealership – I received no response from him. Instead, I got a phone call from one of his minions.
No apology was given, just some feeble excuses as to why they couldn’t honour their internet offer. After going round and round for 10 minutes I decided it was futile talking to him, so ended the call.
I shall contact Audi UK and tell them how Inchcape Cheshire Oaks have muddied their good name and reputation."
3/15/17,5,"I love the new showroom, the people are friendly and helpful. My salesman, Tim, was really helpful and I ended up with a Volkswagen CC that I'm looking forward to receiving as soon as possible. There were a few bumps along the way but with every bump I was kept informed. It was a great experience."
3/14/17,4,"Major service for a 8 year old Golf and fixing starting problem. Very well looked after by Aaron at Exeter who rang with updates during the day. Initial booking contact is with Inchcape call centre in Essex. Rang on the Monday and was able to get booked in on the Thursday. Prices were clearly advised. Also was booked in for a cam belt change at the same time, however Exeter rang the day before and said this was not necessary as the car does not have a cam belt! Starting problem was diagnosed and fixed. Additional work on disc brakes and wiper blades was recommended and accepted. Car was washed afterwards but not polished. Paperwork showed incorrect registration number though despite telling them several times that it was wrong. Exeter VW has a large modern facility with plenty of room for customer parking."
3/14/17,5,Excellent service from start to finish
3/14/17,5,"From start to finish our experience was very good, all aspects of our purchase and part exchange where dealt with very well, Big Thanks to Darren for all his help and clear information"
3/14/17,5,"my car was booked in for its mot, my service advisor was Paul Wyke he went through the procedure with such a professional and helpful attitude that I would certainly look forward to seeking his assistance when I bring my car for its major service later this year, 5star service from a 10 star Paul."
3/13/17,2,After today's experience (that unfortuantely still hasn't rectified my vehicle) I can easily state that this is the second terrible escapade that I have encountered at this servicing dealership. Never again will I take my vehicle here. I would rather struggle to the Warrington dealership than have to struggle with the unorganised chaos that I have been part of today.
3/13/17,5,Helpful staff and efficient service. I would recommend them.
3/13/17,5,"acknowledged,informed and advised of all that i needed to know"
3/13/17,5,"I can only say that our experience at Inchcape Macclesfield has been most excellent, as usual. Many thanks to Gareth in the Service Dept."
3/13/17,5,"Staff very helpful
Kept up to date and informed of any changes ect .
Good personnel service"
3/13/17,5,"Went with our daughter with a view to test drive and buy an A3. Came away having both bought a Q3! Usually find buying a new car quite stressful but I have to say Neil Cameron made the experience a delight from beginning to end. All the staff we came into contact with at Audi Macclesfield were friendly, helpful and welcoming. I would certainly recommend this Audi dealership as one to go to for excellent customer service."
3/13/17,5,"The staff are very helpful and kind, their welcome is so warm and polite.
I was very pleased with the prompt service and the expert engineers who did a thorough checkup on the vehicle. Many thanks again."
3/13/17,3,"Average dealer standards. Silver wheel weights added to a predominantly black wheel just shows lack of finishing standards and care. Not a deal breaker but with expensive alloys you want them to look there best like the other wheels on the car which all have black weights to blend in. Also, not sure why front and rear wheels haven't been switch to give even tyre where (or at least recommend a switch as stated in the hand book). Fronts are obviously wearing quicker than rears but are all well within the legal limits with a few thousand miles left on each. Very quick to offer a cost for replacing tyres instead. Finding somewhere to park is always a problem at Harold Wood, puncture repair was expensive, service was a little pricey for a visual check with oil change and the car wash was appalling (but that's complimentary so can't really complain about that). No complaints with staff, all were polite.
Like most main dealers, it always feels like is about how many cars they can get in and out as quickly as possible."
3/13/17,1,We had to take our car to have it's emissions fixed due to Audi's fraudulent actions. For this privilege we had to pay Audi £15 to cover the insurance on a courtesy car. The courtesy car was full of dog hairs and smelt of wet dog. When we got our car back the battery box cover had not been replaced properly and rattled in the engine bay. The car was running very rough and now misses when accelerating. As with all dealerships you are a King when buying a new car but as soon as you sign on the dotted line you return to being a peasant!!
3/13/17,5,Ricky was top of his game and knowledgable and helpful throughout the process and got me exactly what I wanted with the budget I had
3/13/17,1,"Has been in for 5 days for upgrade to emissions and sat nav,still don't no when it's coming back,was brought back with a fault light on and they thought I would expept it back like that,they did have payment though"
3/13/17,5,Great service
3/13/17,5,"Would expect nothing less from a premium brand dealer and Cooper Durham BMW have always delivered just that.
Cracking car [new M3], cracking dealer. Perfect!"
3/12/17,5,"All staff very friendly and helpful, but not ott"
3/12/17,5,"Inchcape showed themselves to be a company that cares that their customers are happy with their experience of buying a new car. We were treated well and in a friendly way by Richard and Mo.
We would recommend Inchcape for their excellent company values which gave us confidence that they could provide a good deal on a new car and that we would be treated properly."
3/12/17,5,"after looking locally on the Wirral for a VW ,and being shocked at the level
or lack of service and product knowledge from the local VW dealer, , myself and partner Mrs Atkinson went to Inchcape Chester, when we arrived we were greeted by a lovely charming lady, whose name escapes me.
but anyway she then directed us to a sales person Brian Sutton , who was very professional and his approach to the sales process was very informative and professional ,Mr Sutton could not do enough for us so very helpful
Being an ex car sales Executive of many yrs in main dealers, I was very impressed with Mr Sutton and Inchcape VW Chester.
thanks Mrs Atkinson is very pleased with the car
thanks again
Jeff Kitchen"
3/11/17,5,"Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Our salesman, Tony, was very knowledgeable and actually answered any questions we had instead of just telling us what he wanted us to know and tried his utmost to pair us with the car we wanted not the car he wanted us to have, which so many garages try to do.I would have no hesitation in returning and would certainly trust the person we dealt with."
3/11/17,5,"From beginning to final delivery, excellent honest down to earth service from Neil Cameron the Sales Executive. A good experience. Thank you."
3/10/17,5,"Cannot fault in anyway. Staff were very friendly.
Thank you"
3/10/17,5,Easy to book and at a competitive pre agreed price. A friendly and reliable service I would recommend
3/10/17,5,"I dealt with Graham at H. A. Fox in Chester for a Jaguar purchase. I found him a gentlemen, with a no nonsense and honest attitude. It was a pleasure to deal with him.
Thanks
Brendan"
3/10/17,5,The people that handled the booking-in and drop-off were courteous and both procedures were straight forward. My customer liaison representative was friendly and efficient and my car was returned in good time the same day.
3/9/17,5,"Great staff, excellent cutomer service would recommend this Audi garage to anyone"
3/9/17,5,Fantastic garage
3/9/17,5,"Many thanks to Lee in the parts department,fantastic help and service with exceptional parts des patch and delivery times.
Would highly recommend using their service, for any car parts required."
3/9/17,5,The car we wished to test drive was available. Clare was very well informed and helpful. She arranged delivery of our car when we were not able to collect it ourselves. The delivery driver was also very helpful and friendly. An excellent experience.
3/9/17,5,"Brilliant service , Jonathan at Stockport Audi was fantastic and made the process smooth and easy , love our new A6 , the flowers the wife received on collection was a lovely touch
Thanks"
3/9/17,5,Always great service very helpful and a dealer I trust
3/9/17,5,"I have once again no complaints about staff or repairs to my vechicle. I am however extremely disappointed to be informed that the sat nav in my Freelander is unable to have its mapping updated, it was one of my requirements when purchasing my vechicle and I have been forced to purchase an independent device."
3/9/17,5,"trustworthy, and explained everything thoroughly"
3/9/17,5,"Very professional sales executive handled the purchase of my Audi A3 which arrived ahead of schedule, and exceeded my expectations in every way. I was disappointed that the accessories which I have requested were not installed on the car before delivery, but was assured that these will be installed in the next two weeks. I was delighted with the overall experience and would definitely use in the future."
3/9/17,4,Took my car back after discovered a leak in the bottom of the boot it was eventually found that the main rubber seal around the boot lid was faulty and was replaced also had its first mot there also had the brake fluid changed as recommended by them.The service staff ( Loren ) was very helpful and obliging and kept me informed throughout.When I eventually change my Volkswagen Passat I will definitely use this main dealer again.
3/9/17,5,"From my first contact with Maidstone Audi I received excellent service from this dealership. Throughout the entire process of purchasing my new car Dan kept me very well informed at every stage of the process through email, telephone calls and face to face meetings. He was extremely welcoming, friendly, always helpful and patient with me and was never 'pushy'. I felt extremely comfortable throughout my purchasing experience and would have no hesitation in highly recommending Maidstone Audi. And, of course I'm absolutely delighted with my new car !"
3/9/17,1,"Hunters picked up my Landrover for servicing. Told it would be dropped back next day. No car showed late in the afternoon the following day. Tried to call as needed car the next day. Couldn't get through. Eventually left a message to call me with update. Still no one returned my call that day. Called twice in the morning to find out as really desperate for a car. Still at 10:30am no call !!!
Another awful experience with Hunters again. Every time I have used this company has been an absolute disaster. From initially purchasing the vehicle. To two services has been an absolute disaster. Use any other approved Landrover dealer for sales and servicing."
3/8/17,5,"I honestly could not have asked for more. Maybe I'm quite undemanding but all my expectations were very well met. Car dropped off - met with lovely service in good time, really good updates throughout the process, ready when I asked, clean car with all services undertaken.
I had a Ford before an Audi - enough said I think 🙂"
3/8/17,5,Very good service and we were well looked after whilst we waited
3/8/17,4,Good deal. Easy to talk to . Poor parework
3/8/17,5,first class service from HA Fox
3/8/17,5,"My reason for visiting Hunters was for my Freelander's annual service which I have been doing for the past few years.
The booking process is easy and this time I opted to wait whilst they did the service, although I went for a nice walk, I was offered a hot drink and a comfortable waiting area if I chose.
The service was done to my complete satisfaction plus I received a video to my mobile phone showing me around the underside of my car.
I was notified when my car was ready and the paperwork and handover of the car was seamless.
I am totally satisfied with Hunters, enough to buy my third new vehicle from them shortly."
3/8/17,5,"Very good, as always"
3/8/17,5,"Every time I have booked a service or repair to my Jaguar I have had
very good service and always on time.
And at the price they have quoted and if you have a service plan you get
discount on parts and fitting and on a MOT cant be bad.
Yours Alan Graham
A very happy customer."
3/8/17,4,I recently purchased a new BMW 1.8i series car. The experience from start to finish was unbelievable. The service I received was first class. Everything was explained explicitly and covered everything before I left the showroom. Would not hesitate to recommend these dealers. Being a women purchasing a car I was treat with great respect and was treated amicabley. Thank you.
3/8/17,5,"Very good service and very helpful, would recommend."
3/8/17,4,"I decided we were going to buy a new petrol Golf if we got the price I mentally accepted. This was achieved via Kerry Hodder whom we found pleasant, personable and professional throughout. I'm not sure I entirely enjoyed being iPad filmed driving out of the showroom but Kerry did very well.
My reservations concern VAG diesel 'liars emissions' and, whilst our affected vehicles have received relevant upgrades, there remains a concern regarding trust. No one from VAG has, to date, offered any goodwill. This is not acceptable thus the issue remains."
3/8/17,4,"Could not fault the quality of workmanship, the efficiency,or the ability to discuss with the service manager what had been done in the service."
3/8/17,5,"I initially went to Mercedes Benz of Warrington to have a test drive of the latest model B-Class, automatic. This was to upgrade from my existing B-Class, manual 09-plate. Very helpful staff and a decent test drive. In the showroom was a new B-200d AMG Line Premium, Auto. As I was intending to upgrade and this met my requirements, I decided to purchase. The salesman agreed a decent discount as it was pre-17 plate and gave me a good trade-in value for my existing car. We talked through all aspects of the personal lease plan and hey presto.......I bought it. I'm really pleased with the car and very satisfied with the sales team and after sales service. Good result."
3/8/17,5,"Easy to book and wait while MOT, service and tyre change carried out. Free wash'n'vac as well.

Comfortable waiting area with TV, refreshments and wi-fi. I took my laptop and did some work"
3/8/17,5,"You drive a premium type of car, so you expect a premium service from where you buy or have your pride & joy. And that's what you get from Cooper TW, simple as. Premium car, premium service does come at a premium funnily enough!"
3/8/17,4,TO CALL CENTRE TO MAKE BOOKING BUT AFTER THAT EVERYTHING WAS WXCELLENT
3/7/17,5,"Started looking to buy an Audi S3 at Macclesfield Audi in October 2016. The salesman was keen to make the buying process as enjoyable as possible. All conversations where engaging and there was a commitment to answer all questions concisely and any that could not be answered on the day would be answered at a later date and not forgotten about. There where regular video / email updates to plot my cars progress. Projected arrival date for the car was February, and it was, so the car could be prepared in plenty of time. I was happy to receive my car almost a week in to March as I did not want to have a rushed Hand Over. The Hand Over was straight forward and relatively quick with option to take out various insurance options, that where explained to me without pressure to sign up and always with a really good cup of coffee. The car reveal was in a well lit room and the car was immaculate. There was ample time for the salesman to explain and demonstrate the cars options and discus cars in general.
Throughout the whole process all the staff I spoke to, both showroom and technician's where very knowledgeable of the Audi product and would make every effort to make purchasing of my Audi S3 Black edition as enjoyable as possible."
3/7/17,3,"Following research and reviews etc,I decided that I wanted an Audi Q2 without paying new car taxes and went for a three month old ex demonstration model and saw one advertised advertised by Inchcapeaudi in Stockport.

Basically, the sales executive was very friendly and helpful in arranging purchase which was over the telephone and via e-mail etc as I was 300 miles from Stockport. He arranged for the vehicle to be fitted with a towbar prior to collection, at my request and purchase. He also ensured there was a tank of fuel to get me home.

There was no discount because they can sell these vehicles easily but I still went ahead with the purchase. Upon arrival, the vehicle was standing on the forecourt in the rain. Now admittedly to Stockport Audi, this is just a second hand car - 12 weeks old. However to me, at £24400, it was MY NEW CAR. Had I paid less for a new but lesser variant I wonder if the treatment would have been the same. I felt that the corporate attitude was lacking towards someone spending a not inconsiderable amount of money (to me) to the extent that there were not even key fobs attached to the keys.

Would I deal with Inchcape Audii again - NO. Would I recommend them - NO"
3/7/17,5,"Having travelled from Plymouth to Essex I needed to have an alloy gator replaced. These guys were great, managed to get the car sorted really quickly for me. Thanks to all involved, special thanks to Natasha at Service reception. Really professional and efficient team my car was in very good hands."
3/7/17,5,"Bought a lovely A3 Cabriolet from Tetbury Audi. Probably one of the most stress free car purchases thanks to the attention of Kieren in Sales. Car to exact specification, delivered on time, at a competitive price; they even have an 'unveiling' ceremony which added a bit of fun when collecting the car. The slightest query is met with 'come in and have a coffee and we'll sort it' (hasn't been necessary so far) and nothing seems too much trouble. On my experience so far I have no hesitation in recommending this organisation."
3/7/17,5,"I received excellent customer service at Inchcape, no complaints"
3/7/17,5,"I had a 60k service on my diesel Tiguan and the whole experience was excellent, from the booking in to the customer care and return of the car. I particularly liked the healthcheck video which was sent to me prior to getting the car back - very informative. Overall very professional and a pleasant experience all round - well done everyone! :-)"
3/7/17,5,"As always, excellent customer service and absolute professionalism from everyone, and in particular Kieren Bromham and Mike Hewitt."
3/7/17,5,"No pressure, straight forward process for a new car, thanks Nik!"
3/7/17,5,"I found Inchcapeaudi very easy and pleasant to deal with.Both Les Peters and Phil Sidderley looked after me very well( plus all the reception staff). They found me the exact vehicle I was looking for and offered me a good price for old vehicle.
I love my new Audi Q3 !"
3/7/17,5,Spot on in every aspect. Treated with the upmost care and attention from the first visit. Will continue to use this dealership for many years
3/7/17,5,"Picked up, serviced, returned, fuss free, super service."
3/7/17,2,"My Car broke down at work, something to do with a software upgrade. It happen a lunch time, you came out about 3:30 ish finished work about 5:00. But let me know the car had to go in to be looked at and the car was picked up about 8. A car could not be supplied because it was past 5:30 even when I placed the first request for a replacement car before 5:30 so I was left at work until I made my own arrangements. I was told 2 days later it was a software upgrade that was needed and got charged £114, frustratingly the week before it had been serviced (I have a service plan) why was it not picked up. After phoning Mercedes direct I was refunded but even then it took 4/5 weeks and many phone calls between the Leicester branch and the Loughborough branch. All together not a very slick operation."
3/6/17,3,"My car was serviced but having left it at 10.30 to collect at 5pm I was on my way to collect my car when I received a phone call at 4.50 saying that they had finished my service and couldn't find the intermittent fault with my dashboard computer, I was asked if I wanted my car valetted still and I said yes as it is part of my service, I arrived was shown to the waiting area within 5 mins I was told my car was ready , the seats were wet the cleaning of my car was awful , round wing mirrors etc poor vacuuming and it wasn't until next day I saw the result of a rushed valet , areas had been missed totally a mess.The guy on handover knew I wasn't happy at having to wait so a softener of a key ring was given to me but to hand over a wet inside which I stood and dried myself before I left was wrong.i never said anything else I was angry and would have said too much so left dissatisfied"
3/6/17,5,"Thank you George for looking after me and my cabriolet, efficient and personal service ."
3/6/17,5,"Excellent service throughout from taking the car in early to the service desk remaining open late so that I could collect the car. No hidden ""extras"" found re: the MOT Test even though it was close to the expiry date."
3/6/17,5,would highly recommend.
3/6/17,5,"Throughout the whole process of purchasing our new Audi, the staff at Cheshire Oaks were very polite and courteous, in particular Nick our sales person, he was very professional, helpful and knowledgeable, keeping us fully informed of all updates.

Very Impressed, down to earth approach."
3/6/17,3,"Golf booked for 1st service and requested return at 12.00. Text and voicemail received just after 12.00 saying car ready for collection. On arrival told not ready and being cleaned. Eventually given keys and told car outside main reception. It was not and took a while to find the car parked away in the middle of other cars. When found driver side had dirty polythene seat cover still there, dirty paper floor cover and dirt on Driver seat. Service Manager inspected, apologised and rectified the issues. However car eventually ready at 12.55, nearly an hour later. To be fair this is the first problem I have had in about 10 years at Inchcape Chelmsford."
3/6/17,5,Pick up very prompt and pleasant and kept in touch with progress. Efficient
3/6/17,2,"A sale condition for the car was that the first service was free of charge. However, Inchcapeaudi not only charged for the service but have repeatedly failed to respond to telephone requests for them to investigate and explain why a charge was taken. Repeated promises that they would phone back, but nothing from them. A very disappointing customer experience."
3/6/17,4,Inchcape Sandhurst have time for customers after they have bought any type of vehicle. Well done ! Toyota
3/6/17,5,"It has been a pleasure buying my new Audi Q2 at Macclesfield Audi.
Neil Cameron was the sale person that I dealt. From start to finish I have never felt pressured, pushed or stressed.

Great experience! Thank you!"

Collection of the car was easily as smooth"
3/6/17,5,Service was excellent.
3/6/17,4,"Quick routine service while I waited in pleasant surroundings. Failed to fix a minor bodywork issue where a panel had come slightly away. So, good at routine stuff but questionable when it comes to fettling minor problems."
3/6/17,5,Cannot find any fault
3/6/17,5,"I cannot fault both of the sales men that assisted in selling me my new Q2, Andrew and Darren.

The car is amazing, I love it.

My only gripe is with Audi itself. I didn't get any breakdown cover or any little extras. Basically if you wanted it then you have to pay for it.

I felt that a little harsh as I had spent a lot of money purchasing the car."
3/6/17,5,"Extremely happy with the manner and professional attitude I was treated with.
Was completely satisfied with all my requirements from the company's staff all have a very welcoming attitude and very helpful in all ways
Thank you against n"

Haggled for the deal I needed at the right price point and despite that, the service continued to be excellent. Email and telephone comms was superb and in each visit to the showroom I was impressed with the professionalism of all the staff present. I'd recommend Jonathan and all at Audi Macc to anyone looking to purchase a new or used car in the future. I look forward to doing business with them again in years to come."

Highly recommended VW centre"
3/3/17,5,MOT was carried out swiftly and any work needed doing was discussed beforehand - any questions we had were answered professionally
3/3/17,5,"Everyone that I came into contact with at Swindon, seemed very personable and efficient. I was kept fully informed of delivery schedules by Chris Kilworth and always felt welcome.

The only thing missing was a small token/gift that I normally expect when buying quite an expensive car, but this is a minor detail."
3/3/17,5,"Very impressed by this dealership! It was friendly and welcoming originally and I was given a great deal and professionally well looked after by a very good salesman! I would recommend this Audi dealership to everyone!
KS."
3/3/17,5,Not too pushy!

My sister,who was with me when I chose the car couldn't believe the high standard of care I was getting.
Thank you Twickenham Volkswagen."
3/3/17,4,"Inchcape Volkswagen in Twickenham provided good, efficient and friendly service from the time I dropped off my vehicle through to the moment I picked it up following it's service and MOT. This included the use of a courtesy car minimising disruption to my working day.

I was also kept informed of the work being completed and that it was available for pick-up ."
3/3/17,1,"The customer service manager tried to sell us thousands of pounds of work we didn't need, allowed us to carry out work he knew wasn't the problem and was rude when I collected the car. Car is still not fixed and has additional faults that it didn't have before being taken to VW."
3/3/17,1,"I Purchased a 64 plate Toyota Yaris in February 2017 from this dealership. Customer service was excellent and paper work was prepared promptly once I made payment. The car only had one owner. Unfortunately , last week I found out that it was an ex- driving school car. Due to poor installation/removal of dual controls the carpet on the front passenger side is wet/damp. I think if this information was disclosed beforehand , I would have bought a different car considering what learner drivers do to the clutch /gear etc.."
3/3/17,5,I have just bought another car from Audi Crawley. They are very welcoming and helpful
3/3/17,5,"Having bought from Audi Stockport before and being very pleased with my Audi Q3 I decided that after 4 years it was time to change to a new car. I decided to wait until the launch of the new Q2 as we wanted a slightly smaller car and from entering the showroom and seeing the model on show I knew that was the car I wanted. The person who saw me was Rebecca and if I could award her 6 stars instead of 5 then I would do so. As soon as we agreed a trade in price for my Q3 and me agreeing to buy the Q2 , Rebecca kept me informed every step of the way. I even added a few optional extras shortly after my initial order and these were added without any problems. Collection of my new car was an enjoyable experience and I would definitely recommend Rebecca and Audi Stockport."
3/3/17,5,"They have sales staff that will try and jump hoops for you, Elaine Marsden in particular."
3/3/17,5,Prompt attention and a new service - a video of you car's inspection.
3/3/17,4,"Good service, excellent customer care. Was greated with warmth by the customer care guy.

Only to mention car was not cleaned properly from inside. There were chocolate marks near the sd card slot and around the gear box. Also it was not very clean overall. Dust particles were all around the car."
3/3/17,5,Audi Tunbridge Wells have always given me excellent service from the day I bought my car 7 years ago. They keep you informed at all times. They are consistent in their quotation and billing process and will always advise if additional items need to be undertaken. The pricing is competitive and the car is always returned clean and tidy. No complaints at all.
3/3/17,5,"Just purchased new car through Crawley Audi. Excellent service throughout with particular thanks to Stewart Bannister. Whole process was an absolute pleasure and some of the little touches were great, such as the video updates and myaudi portal. Highly recommended"
3/3/17,2,"My 2016 health check stated rear brakes 80% worn (2015 stated 50%) so I went to the garage to get them changed. I was told my brakes didn't need changing as they were only 25%. I was very confused to say the least! We also asked for the battery to be checked, 1 minute we thought we needed one the next minute we didn't another communication error between the garage and the desk. Whilst I can accept human error as we all make mistakes I am left wondering and will seek a 2nd opinion. Customer liaison was professional, courteous and helpful and I couldn't fault her customer service, it's the back of house where I have the problem."
3/3/17,5,Excellent service staff brilliant 5star👍
3/3/17,5,What more can I say? Efficient and competent all round
3/3/17,2,"Contacted dealer by telephone enquiring about a new Golf GTD.Was told ""we will ring you back"" No body rang back. Telephoned first thing next day,different salesperson ""will ring you back"" No ringback by 5.00pm.Attended dealer next day initial meet with salesperson,figures and vehicles discussed.Returned with partner next day ,unfortunately ""figures"" did not add up so no sale.Replied to e mail from Inchcape requesting feedback and requested a ""callback"" from a manager, Guess what ? No body called back !!! Deaership did not appear ""Hungry""for a sale. Not prepared to go the extra mile to clinch the deal .Trade in price appeared non negotiable .A Poor Experience."
3/2/17,5,"I made a great choice of my car with Toyota Derby. I'm really pleased with professional advice, welcoming atmosphere and great customer service. Very good financial scheme offer for my first car. All the service I received was just excellent. This is the company to stay for many years with. Definitely worth recommending!"
3/2/17,5,"Booked my car in for mot, they kept me informed sent me a video before returning car washed and hoovered."
3/2/17,5,"It was exhilarating to find a supplier who still has pride in ""delighting"" their customers. Excellent experience could not be faulted. To be recommended. To anyone."
3/2/17,1,Slow. Waited over a day and a half for a phone call the gave up and went to the dealership waited over a hour to be seen. Don't return phone calls. Quoted £200 over standard BMW price. Lied about warranty. AVOID AT ALL COSTS
3/2/17,5,"Great service done at a competitive price,very detailed description of the service that was carried out and any issue that occurred.thanks would recommend Stockport Audi ."
3/2/17,1,"Bought an ex-management car in November which arrived on delivery day with a rather large scratch, repaired by the body shop and looks as it should, still a very poor service to try and hand over scratched.

Developed a fault same week, took it back, fault rectified but car had been impacted on the front end, resprayed entire front end, very poor job. Told to take my car home for Christmas on December 23rd and still waiting for them to be bothered to fix it, its now March 2nd.

I would avoid H A Fox Preston as their service facility have twice scratched my car and rather than put their hands up they have hoped i didn't notice...

Shocking Service.

Thanks for your reply, i have been working with him for months, no point in letting him know, stall waiting for him to call me back."
3/2/17,5,"Started looking to replace my car at Xmas, initial enquiry with David King at Macclesfield Audi to discuss my requirements was both professional and courteous. David offered a number of fine options, kept in touch without being overbearing and after returning from a trip to Spain/Portugal helped galvanise my thoughts and I decided to purchase the RS7.
Took delivery earlier this week, what a car! More a work of art than a vehicle!
I could not be happier with the purchase and can highly recommend both David and Audi Macclesfield.
After buying many cars over the years from different Main dealers the reason my last 4 have been Audis is, apart from how good the cars are themselves, the way you are treated and dealt with makes all the difference.
Thanks again and see you when I'm looking to change, might be a while!"
3/2/17,5,We recently experienced excellent service from Tom Matten at Tetbury Audi when purchasing our Audi TTRS. The handover was thorough & professional and the car was very well presented. Tom's aftercare service was also excellent. We would have no hesitation in recommending.
3/2/17,5,"My experience of Inchscape Volkswagen Oldham is Great. This is the second time that i have used them for repair or for service. As soon as you walk in , the customer service is there, They ask you what help you require etc, They are very friendly and helpful. Even offer you free coffee. The work that they do to your vehicle, is of a very high standard. They also wash and clean the interior of the car before they return the car to you. I would highly recommend them."
3/1/17,5,"Very well trained staff,attention to detail,who are very keen to please,nothing is too much trouble.Poor and indifferent customer service is annoyingly endemic in our society,but this is outstanding."
3/1/17,5,"We experienced a totally different attitude to buying a car from Inchcape Volkswagon Bury than a previous VW dealer we visited. At Oldham we found the staff extremely helpful. We dealt with Isaac who was friendly, helpful & straight to the point (just how we like it) and made it easy to make a decision. We also found the Sales Manager Paul Hudson to be friendly and approachable and very much appreciated his kind gesture, We have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Inchcape Volkswagon Bury."
3/1/17,5,"I have been a customer of Macclesfield Audi for over ten years and my experience has always been very positive.
The service team are excellent, never had a problem with any aspect, booking the car in, quality of work, courtesy cars etc. and returning a washed car on time.
The sales team are knowledgeable and professional, the process of buying my current vehicle from them was trouble free and the car was delivered ahead of time.
Would recommend this Centre without reservation."

I would recommend Swindon Audi to anyone, the experience was a very pleasant one."
2/28/17,5,"My BMW 530D M-Sport Touring came in here after its glow-plugs failed-me - on a very cold night in Feb 2017. Despite the fact that mine was an unplanned breakdown, when they managed to find a loan-car for me, I also opted for a full service.
I'd never used Cooper BMW Banstead before now. It's not my nearest branch of Cooper BMW, but this Banstead branch has totally refreshed my confidence in Cooper BMW as a dependable service centre. Great service. Thank you so much."
2/28/17,5,"Great service, especially from David Mort - always a pleasure to see & be looked after by him"

Went in at short notice, turned it around quickly, no hidden charges, car cleaned inside and out.
Enjoyable and professional service and more than enough to retain my future custom."
2/27/17,4,"Booking in the car for the work to be done was a problem.
I rang the Manchester number for the work to be carried out at Gilbert Lawton, Manchester.
I explained that my MOT was due to expire on 5th Mar but notwithstanding this I was told the earliest date the work could be car attended to was in mid March so I didn't book my car in.
In the letter I received about recalling my car for the NOx emissions remedial work two other telephone nos. were given one a Bolton no. What a contrast, the gentleman I spoke to couldn't have been more helpful, He gave me a date for all the work to be carried out well before 5th March and guess where the work was to be carried out, Gilbert Lawton, Manchester. On the day of the work everything went well and all staff I interacted with were superb."
2/27/17,5,"From entering Macclesfield Audi on a very busy day. I was well looked after, promptly introduced to Adrian from sales personnel. Well looked after from the test drive to collecting the vehicle.
Swift smooth transaction. I will be recommending Macclesfield Audi to my friends and family."

I use Inchcape Bolton VW for my repairs and servicing and always find the service & reception staff extremely satisfactory."
2/23/17,2,"Have bought my cars from Audi and serviced by Audi East Kent for many years. Booked car in for major service which was completed. Distance sensor light was lit prior to service. Audi East Kent did not diagnose what was the problem simply tried code reader reset. Dealership carried out health safety check as part of service on the vehicle, which was signed off as healthy, then proceeded to return the car with safety systems that are not working. Turns out the ACC unit has failed which is unusual. Discussed with Audi but due to car just out of warranty offer was for me to pay £650 toward repair. This is not a consumable part plus Audi have Technical Service Bulletins for this particular failure."
2/23/17,4,"While the service was being carried out I was sent an email recommending two additional items. In the event, the brake fluid change was carried out as part of my service plan, but I had to point out that the Haldex fluid was not due until 40000 miles"
2/23/17,4,"Good service but , still a bit pricey"
2/23/17,5,"We received a brilliant service from Matt, from our telephone call enquiring about the car to picking it up. Would have no reservations about recommending Audi Macclesfield. We came from Merseyside to collect the car we wanted and it was definitely worth the journey."
2/22/17,5,Just purchased a new BMW X3 from Cooper Teesside. Would like to make a special mention of our sales assistant- Michael Sweeney- he was outstanding throughout the entire process. Entirely professional and courteous throughout even with a delayed delivery date (beyond his control). This is my 2nd purchase of a new vehicle from them and will definitely be back for a 3rd in the future.
2/20/17,5,"Bought a new TT ( 1.8 Sport) from Macclesfield Audi. Jonathan Meigh looked after us. Found the car we wanted, applied good discount and fair p/x on our old car. Deal done quickly. Estimated delivery was 2/3 weeks, and that's what happened. Collection process was enjoyable. Love the car."
2/20/17,5,"As soon as I walked into Audi, Tunbridge Wells I felt looked after. The staff were very friendly and made me feel comfortable. They kept me updated with my car. I had originally rung another Audi garage in Eastbourne to book my car in for a service however due to their service I called Tunbridge Wells and they couldn't have been more helpful. I will definitely be bringing my car back to Audi Tunbridge Wells. I would highly recommend them."
2/20/17,2,"We purchased a used car from Inchcape Toyota Sandhurst.

During the test drive we noticed the car was full of dog hairs and smelt strongly of Dog.

We were assured the car would be treated with an ""Air Con Bomb"" to remove the scent and fully valeted to clean it. Neither of these occurred the car was poorly hoovered and had some kind of scent sprayed on a few small areas of upholstery which soon faded to reveal the stench of wet dog.

While collecting the car we noticed there was only one key. When we asked where the other was we were promised it would be sent to us. We are still waiting on this other key and the dealership has been evasive when we phoned, promising to get the correct person to call us back which often doesn't happen and when it does the key issue is not resolved.

Based on this experience I would never purchase another vehicle from any Inchcape group dealer ever again and would urge others to avoid them."
2/19/17,4,the staffs are very friendly and welcoming.
2/19/17,5,My car needed work to complete a recall. I was told how long it would take and it was completed in the time quoted. My car was also washed in the time. The service advisor was very friendly and showed me a video of the mechanic working on my car which I found very interesting. I would highly recommend this garage to anyone who needs work to be done on their VW.
2/19/17,5,"The service levels were second to none, very professional, friendly and efficient. They kept me updated on the arrival of my new vehicle throughout and as for the vehicle, its ace.
Dave Mull"
2/18/17,1,"Before you hand over the cash they'll promise the world, afterwards complete and utter rubbish. Never before have I had such poor customer service. Rude on the phone and takes more than one phone call to answer. They put the Mercedes brand to shame. Should've never given them my money, absolute cowboys. Wouldn't recommend this dealer to anyone."
2/17/17,4,Great service and friendly staff but the standard of the valeting could have been better.
2/17/17,5,As always the service was great from Bolton Audi
2/16/17,5,Could not be better service
2/16/17,4,Great service as usual
2/16/17,5,Excellent customer service. I was able to use an office to work in whilst my car was in for a major service which was very helpful.
2/16/17,5,"I have used this garage for 3 years now and the service given is always of the highest order, the staff are pleasant, very human in the way they deal with you and I have nothing but praise for the set up.

Once I even brought the car in on the wrong day (a day early) and they still fitted me in to their busy schedule, excellent.

My MOT and brake fluid change was very quick."
2/15/17,5,"Dropped my car off as instructed and checked in at the help desk. They had a courtesy car ( New A1 ) as promised waiting and after a couple of signatures I was off.
A few hours later they called me to say come collect all OK...

A description was put to me of work done and Brake wear status.

After a nice little gift being handed to me a winter and clean kit in a bag.. I was off, no fuss.

Cant be better then that surely......."
2/15/17,5,"After having an incredibly bad experience at a rival Land Rover franchise, I went to Hunters Land Rover Derby's website, and found a car that I was interested in.

Trevor Bailey dealt with my purchase, and gave me a reassuring professional service from start to finish. He went above and beyond expectations, which I really appreciated. The car was genuinely described and I am extremely happy with my purchase. Trevor, is really nice to deal with, and follows up in every way.

I would have no hesitation in using Trevor in the future, and would recommend him to anyone looking for a smooth purchase if a Land Rover."
2/15/17,1,Crap is all I can say
2/15/17,5,This was a hassle free service. The reception staff were most helpful in arranging a lift into town since on booking I had said this would be unnecessary. I was kept well informed on progress and the car was ready at the time promised.
2/14/17,5,Dean provided excellent support and paid attention to every detail. Followed up at every stage to make sure I was fully informed and satisfied. Love the car (Audi A1). Exactly what I needed.
2/14/17,5,"We were looking for a second car and the salesman we met, Sean, was really helpful. No pressure and very informative. A week later we returned for a test ride and purchased. Excellent experience throughout and a range of well priced really nice used cars with known history. Would recommend ti"
2/14/17,5,Very pleased with my service. Easy to book and was able to collect earlier than planned. Even got short a video of the underside inspection and tyre condition.
2/14/17,5,"Another satisfactory visit to Macclesfield Audi and the friendly faces that greet you, makes a pleasant change. Very impressed with their web cam. message you receive after your cars visit to their workshop.
Extremely satisfied once again."
2/13/17,5,"I must thank Audi Tunbridge Wells for conducting a thorough diagnosis of my problem I had with my vehicle - four new injectors later and thankfully no further engine problems, my vehicle was delivered to my place of work. It had also been given a thorough cleaning and a new rear brake light at no extra cost. Thank you to Adam and his team who were most patient with my earlier rantings. Apologies and thank you sincerely for a job very well done!"
2/13/17,5,"Since I purchased my new SQ5 plus, I have had nothing but amazing customer service from Sam in Sales, Sian, Matt and Ben in servicing.

I will always buy my Audi's from Tunbridge Wells Audi.

One happy customer!"
2/13/17,5,"Naomi was very efficient, professional, courteous and friendly in dealing with the pre-service formalities and the return of the car to us, duly serviced and valeted. Thank you"
2/13/17,5,Audi are the best car company I have worked with. The Stockport team were brilliant.
2/13/17,5,"Ben in the Service department was courteous, honest and helpful.Thank you"
2/11/17,5,Heather was very knowledgeable and went out of her way to make sure I got the car I wanted.
2/11/17,5,Friendly and efficient service. All works explained clearly. Complimentary car wash was a lovely touch - even though I only had brake fluid change.
2/11/17,5,"Great Service as always. Nice friendly staff, I had a slight issue after picking my car up! But i turned round and went back and they sorted right away."
2/10/17,4,Good friendly people. I was kept waiting for a longer time than expected as they were very busy.
2/10/17,5,"Great place to buy a car, we eventually negotiated down to the price I could afford. Holly was great from start to finish. I absolutely love my new car, can't see me getting anything else now!"
2/9/17,1,"Bought a nearly new Discovery Landmark. Car has several issues but Hunters York don't want to know. Tried to use the 30 day 1000 miles return policy and was told sorry you can't do that it's a second hand car what do you expect. A used car should have a 166 point check. What did you do, nothing it's scandalous. When you spend nearly £50k on a car you expect it to be right. Don't buy from these people, they chase you for your business but once they have your money they don't care. Chris Salmon told myself and my wife all sorts to get the deal but when it came to it it was all rubbish."
2/9/17,5,Very helpful and professional team. Sales Executive Jo Clarke in particular was one of the reasons we bought from Cobham; she looked after us extremely well and addressed all our questions. Would highly recommend Cooper Cobham to anyone!
2/9/17,5,"I was very happy with every aspect of the work carried out on my visit last week, however I really hate being badgered for reviews and star ratings afterwards. Had I had any issues I would have said so at the time.
It was however a vast improvement over any of my previous services at Power Road so thank you for that."
2/9/17,5,"Having not purchased a car for some time we can only say how refreshing it was to receive excellent customer service from all the staff in all the various departments, especially Alex who made us feel comfortable, welcome and provided excellent customer care and attention to detail.

Great coffee too!"
2/9/17,4,"Why do organisations persist in asking for reviews, if there had been an issue I would have addressed it at the times and service was good, but pestering me for review is a nuisance don't you understand that!

Further more why do I have to be a Trust pilot member, you asked me for the review, god forgive!!"
2/9/17,5,"Friendly efficient and punctual.
Car always ready on time."
2/9/17,5,"When I arrived at the retailer, check in was both swift and friendly. My car was due to be completed by 1.0pm and it was actually ready before then. My Service Adviser was both friendly and knowledgeable and he explained everything thoroughly."
2/9/17,5,"Very happy with the entire process, professional from start to finish and delivered on everthing they said they would. Good price, fair part exchange and informed representative (Simon Waterman).

Will come back to them first next time I need a car."
2/8/17,5,"just brought my mini from Colchester, superb service from beginning to end
Emma was absolutely fabulous, no pushy sales, she went out of her way on a really cold day to get three different mini's for me to try before I made up my mind. kept in touch by phone during and after the sale to make sure everything was ok.
Colchester Mini keep hold of this lovely lady she is an asset to your company."
2/8/17,5,I had my first car servicing done at Twickenham Inchcape VW. Received v good service from the branch. (I bought my car a year back from the same place).
2/7/17,5,"Jo from Audi Crawley sorted my new car for me the process was painless he arranged the car to be delivered from Crawley to Tetbury to save us the drive to collect it

Russell who delivered the car was very helpful and polite showing us all aspects of the controls and features of the car. The car is immaculate and came with a full tank of fuel/ 12 months road tax and 12 months part and labour warranty, couldn't ask for more.

Well done Audi in a world where you are so used to receiving and
accepting poor service it was very refreshing that you have shown how it can be delivered effortlessly.

Would definitely recommend Jo and Crawley Audi"
2/7/17,5,"I have purchased 4 cars from Hunters Derby now and it just gets better and better.
I deal with Trevor Bailey who has gone above an beyond to ensure I get the best deals so if you are after a used car ask for him!
I have had a couple of issues over the years but it is the way that everyone helps, from Deborah on reception and Bob in service to Chris in finance.
Cant fault them and will be back again.

Thanks guys"
2/6/17,5,Cannot fault Swindon Audi. Very happy with my new car
2/6/17,4,Very pleasant and personable salesman Chris Newman helpful and polite.lots of coffee. Parking a nightmare for customers no spaces.
2/6/17,5,I am very impressed with the service that I received from Ian Earle at Cheshire Oaks Audi. Went out of his was to assist me with my purchase and I would 100% recommend using Cheshire Oaks Audi.
2/6/17,5,"Fantastic customer service, all staff are polite and friendly. From booking my appointment to collecting my car I was kept updated all the way, this was done by phone calls and email. Thank you for your great service, would totally recommend Swindon Audi."
2/6/17,5,Just had car serviced today and it's never felt so good Paul philbert looked after me he was helpful friendly and knowledgeable and kept me updated throughout the process I've been using cooper Croydon for nearly ten years now they always give 1st class service
2/6/17,5,Servicing very efficient as usual.
2/5/17,5,"Had not intended to buy here, just dropped in to look at colours and ask a few questions - but Tom Smith gave excellent attention, plenty of time, and very good and thorough advice regarding my purchase of a new 3 series touring. The price was also good. So I have now taken delivery, and am very pleased with the outcome."
2/5/17,5,Excellent service throughout. Adrian was very professional and of great help. Definitely recommended.
2/5/17,4,Very good service as always
2/4/17,5,"We were very satisfied with the buying and the part exchange deal the was put to us, and especially Matt who we dealt with he was very polite and gave us his full attention in dealing with buying our car, very pleased."
2/4/17,5,"Inchcape Derby deserves it's reputation for great customer service. Our 11-r old Yaris broke down beyond repair. Chris Vickers, the manager there listened and did everything right by us. He kept us informed, kept us mobile, & worked with us till a great solution was found. They treated us like new-car-buyers when we were two mature students who couldn't possibly spend lots. Definitely recommend them. You can guess where we will go for our next car when we are fully qualified!"
2/4/17,4,"The process to buy a newer Mini Cooper, than what I had ,was fine. There was moisture in the front headlamps but this would be dealt with and the car was booked in. I was told that I would get the second set of keys the following week. As I was going away for the next week my husbands phone number was taken and he was to be contacted when to collect the keys. I purchased the mini on the 16th January and went away on the 17th January. On my return my husband had not been contacted so I rang and asked where the keys were. Still were not available so I waited and rang again. I was told that the salesman was on holiday but it would be handed to his manager. Again no feedback about the keys. Very disappointed. A little bit of feedback would have been appreciated . It feels like once the monies and older mini were exchanged the customer care was not so important as the sale was done."
2/3/17,5,"This review is following a visit to Cooper York for the winter safety check and valet offer, but I will add that the service I received when I bought my car a year ago was excellent.
Anyway, booked in for a winter check and as expected staff on site were superb, and made sure I got the Mini brolly included with the offer.
My one and only criticism would be that the standard of the full wash and vacuum was a little disappointing, not terrible, but not what I was expecting either.
I still wouldn't hesitate to recommend Cooper York to anybody though. Thanks."
2/3/17,5,"Very professional, easy and straightforward to deal with. Don't try and flog you anything extra so a pleasant experience. Good, constructive advice given when asked for."
2/3/17,5,"Spotted car on their website, I travelled 150 miles for this car as it had every extra on it I wanted. Ross in sales was polite, professional and very helpful it was a pleasure dealing with him. When I left messages he always returned my calls.
Unfortunately Ross wasn't there the day I collected my car but left me in the capable hands of Gareth. Very impressed with the service 10 out of 10 guys."
2/3/17,5,Well looked after and very helpful
2/3/17,5,Great customer engagement throughout the buying process. Very responsive to my changes. Graham Hall and James Jordan went out ofvtheir way to make the experience simple and hassle free. I love my new car!
2/3/17,5,I've just bought my 6th BMW from Cooper in Norwich. I dealt with James Hurn who had a good knowledge of the cars and at no time was pushy. I picked up my car last Friday and have nothing but good things to say about Cooper BMW.
2/3/17,5,"I had only gone to bmw to get our mot and service done, but while there we wandered around the used car section. I feel im love with one particular car. Our sales lady wasn't pushy, she showed us the car, i took it for a drive then we returned to await the mot. At no point did i feel pushed or pressure but also at no point did i feel that i would be treated any differently if i decided walk away. Overall i would definitely recommend and will use again"
2/3/17,5,"Having just purchased my second (used) Lexus from Derby branch, I cannot praise the team there enough.
Salesman Stuart was very helpful with the selection of vehicle, allowing a thorough test drive and tailoring a finance package to suit me best.
Always look forward to seeing Jo and Holly on the service desk who are so friendly and helpful beyond the call.
Visits are always a pleasure!"
2/3/17,5,"The staff are wonderful and so helpful
The two staff that I had dealings with were
Michael Potts and Brenda weren't out of their way to offer all the products
Buying a X5 was so easy and the swiftness and delivery were breath taking
Absolutely no problems
Would recommend BMW BOLDON any time to all my friends"
2/3/17,5,Booked my car in for its 1st service after a polite reminder by phone that it was due. The whole experience was efficiently handled from the courteous staff to the complimentary car wash. Thank you.
2/3/17,5,I took my car in as the boot would not close . Even though they were very busy and in fact were turning people away whilst I was there Rob arranged for me to have it repaired that afternoon . He even offered me a loan car but luckily I didn't need this .
2/3/17,5,"I bought my new car last week. From start to finish the service from Cooper BMW Ipswich was excellent. The knowledge of the product and efficiency of both Richard, James and colleagues was brilliant. I thoroughly recommend them."
2/3/17,5,Really good customer services. Very attentive and got a great deal. Very happy
2/3/17,1,"A grim experience that just keeps giving.
We purchased a new BMW from them in August 2015 and from the very start is was a painful experience. Due to an error on their part, they hadn't requested a sufficient initial payment. We received a phonecall from them while we were on holiday demanding (yes demanding) that we paid them £1000 immediately or they would take back the car. Since we didn't have on us our preferred account details, we declined their demand and said either we would sort it out upon our return to the country or they were welcome to take back the car. after some whining and threats and escalations first to the sales manager and then to the branch manager, it turned out that they could after all wait until we returned for their payment.
We now find ourselves after 18 months in a different position. When we initial went to the garage, we (I was present at that meeting) we were told that we could purchase the car under their financing agreement over 3 years and that after about 18 months we could look towards the possibility of exchange. I have just enquired into the exchange to be told that they chose to set it up on a 4 year contract instead meaning we are now in a very different position. Rather than being at the break even point in our contract, we now have the scenario of owing £24k on the car but Coopers are offering us £14k for its return.
If I were you and you really do want a BMW, do yourselves a massive favour, DO NOT go anywhere near Coopers BMW.
FYI, despite 3 written requests for their complaints procedure and contact details, I have heard nothing back... If I do not hear from them before the end of the week, I will be forced to approach the financial ombudsman. I am signing off here and will be contacting trading standards...
Requested figures in writing three times now and a week later still nothing. Also was promised copies of finance agreement since mine are missing signatures. Again nothing but silence from them.
Cooper Ipswich consistently set themselves the lowest possible standards and continue to fail to achieve them"
2/2/17,4,"Purchase of a nearly new car went smoothly, agreed a price, car had a couple of modifications done and we picked it up a week later leaving our trade-in. All very well, pleasant and civilised (would have rated 5 stars) with one exception.

We wanted parking sensors installed: although the car has a rear camera you can't see the front of the bonnet at all, and even to the rear it's nice to get an audible warning of something you might not see (especially in the dark). Toyota offers a ""parking pack"" on new cars, and this includes parking sensors, a dashboard display to show which ones are activated, and they switch off when you start driving at normal speed. We asked for them to be installed and were charged about the price of the parking pack. But what we got, as only explained when we complained a while after we got the car, was a ""retrofit"" pack. This has fewer sensors at the front, no dashboard display and they don't switch off at speed. Also, the sound is very irritating. If we'd been told all that we might have either opted out or argued about the price. Now, every time we can't even tell if a beep is from the front or the rear (our previous car used different sound pitch to indicate that), and every time there's a loud beep when we pass near a roadside wall or big obstacle on the kerb, it leaves a slightly sour taste."
2/2/17,5,"Everything was arranged as requested, car was in for service, courtesy car provided, initial handover took a round 15 minutes and car was finished and ready for collection at the agreed time, handover completed in 5 minutes."
2/2/17,5,"Always great service from Gordon Carr at Inchcape Altrincham. The only critic I have is the valet of my car is always mediocre, I could do better myself. Apart from that no grumbles."
2/2/17,5,Great client service from Max Brandish at Cooper MINI Norwich. I wasn't actually intending to buy a car that day but his good customer service and the quality of the car he presented resulted in me putting a deposit down! From start to finish I received great service from him so thank you again.
2/1/17,5,"We recently had the pleasure of purchasing a new Mercedes GLC from Inchcape Mercedes Loughborough.

My sales contact Stuart Conway was the most helpful, courteous and professional car salesman I have met over all the years of buying cars.

Stuart was extremely patient when choosing the right specification for our needs, which is no mean feat considering the large number of options from Mercedes.

Altogether an excellent experience from start to finish and it was well worth the two-hour journey to Loughborough."
2/1/17,5,"Only went in to enquire whether they would cover a car I was thinking of purchasing elsewhere, but saw just what I wanted (apart from it being automatic) on the forecourt. It had only just come in and by the time we were ready to test drive it, the car had disappeared to Brooklands for prep. Went back the next day for a test drive and was so impressed I bought it. Kevin, the Salesman, was very helpful and informative. When I went to collect the car he took the time to go through all the different aspects of the vehicle with me, a lot of which I was not familiar with, so left the garage feeling confident."
2/1/17,5,"I have been lucky enough to buy a new car from Cooper BMW in York. The team there are courteous, helpful and professional. It was a pleasure dealing with them and the process was easy and everything was explained clearly. I also bought my last car from there and have had it serviced there for 4 years, again the service team there are excellent.
However my experience trying to deal with BMW insurance is another matter altogether. They are awful, unhelpful and I ended up not buying my insurance from them. Avoid at all costs! That has marred my experience of BMW to an extent. It's a shame they don't maintain standards and customer care across all arms of the business."
2/1/17,5,Will be back hood service and the cars sell themselves
2/1/17,4,Problems encountered were quickly resolved.
1/31/17,5,"I was served by Jeff who went above and beyond to help me find a car that I wanted that was in my budget. This is the 2nd car I have bought from Jeff, I recommend Cooper Ipswich to everyone!"
1/31/17,5,"From initial visit to view my new car I was impressed with this dealership.
From first arriving I was given courteous & friendly help advice and assistance without any pressure. All the staff are to be commended on their helpfulness particularly Adrian who helped me through the minefield of making this purchase and nothing was too much trouble.
Previously having purchased new MB from other local to myself dealers I can't but help compare the level of service received and as a result decided to travel over 100 miles to North Wales to purchase and will more than likely do so in the future.
On picking up my new car Adrian came in to do the handover even though he was wasn't supposed to be working that day and patiently talked me through every aspect of the car. I was very impressed at this as in my experience handovers on previous purchases elsewhere were basically payment, paperwork and keys.
After sales service excellent too. Follow up phone calls to check all is well and that I had no problems.
Excellent company. Highly recommend them!"
1/31/17,5,"From the straightforward car service to the buying of a new car, I had nothing but helpful and professional attention by your staff.
I would certainly recommend using CooperBMW to my friends and family."
1/31/17,5,"Totally relaxed experience, did not feel pressurised in any way, found our perfect car at the price we expected. The sales executive could not have been more helpful."
1/30/17,3,"During busy times, sales tend to ignore existing customers and don't give equal importance. Otherwise , BMW service is excellent."
1/30/17,5,"My sales executive was Mike, he was amazing with me and helped me pick the car of my dreams! (Happened to be a little Polo!) he has been informative throughout and I couldn't have picked a better sales adviser. Everyone at Inchcape was welcoming and cheerful. They also all made the pick up of my car very special which I was grateful for as I was extremely excited!"
1/30/17,5,Excellent service all round - thank you
1/30/17,5,Tim Green provided support and guidance as we looked at the purchase options available and helped us make a choice that meets our needs.
1/30/17,5,"Having researched the model I wanted to upgrade to, I shortlisted 2cars to test drive at 2 different BMW Dealers. Adam, at Coopers BMW was customer focused from initial contact. Nothing was too much trouble. He answered all my questions thoroughly and talked me through the process. When I went for the test drive, he talked me through all the features and took a route to test the various drive modes and cruise control.
He was friendly, knowledgeable and aware of my specific needs and budget, which he presented to his manager to secure the best package for me. I would highly recommend Coopers BMW, for pre and post sale service and professional staff."
1/30/17,4,"Made the apt, did not have to wait long when I arrived. Job done quickly. Only charged for part. Polite staff."
1/30/17,5,from start to finish professional & friendly
1/30/17,5,First time at HA FOX and one I would recommend. A very professional set up altogether.
1/30/17,5,From start to finish everything went smoothly and everyone were so helpful. Made to feel like an important customer all the way through
1/30/17,1,"Took my car in for Emissions Recall, no problems with car prior to this, car run like a dream, towed caravan long journeys to Scotland and Cornwall in the summer, brilliant. Since Recall drove home from the dealership Car fan came on very loud and intense smell of rubber as if overworking? Thought nothing of it as just come out of dealership. Drove to local shops and fan came on again, drove around 5mile journey again fan came on loud and overworking smell of rubber burning! Steam coming off bonnet, never noticed this before. Contacted dealership could not get through to any one and passed around different departments I was told would call me back. Called back I explained the problem, i was told it's normal, I explained that it's never done this before, i was told it would cost me £96 if Booked in and nothing was found, I complained but it's not my fault this has happened you sold me the car with a hidden fault that's why I'm here,
Passed over to someone else who again was unhelpful, told me it was normal and basically couldn't be bothered."
1/30/17,5,Not only do Audi Stockport provide quality cars but also quality service. Right from a perspective viewing to the collection of a new car their customer service is second to none. If you're thinking of buying an Audi I highly recommend Audi Stockport.
1/30/17,5,"I was Met by Naomi who was efficient and helpful and all with a smile. I've not had great experiences with other VW dealers, but Chester now sets the bar high. Very pleased and well done."
1/30/17,5,Found an exceptional new car that matched my requirements. Excellent service and understanding of my needs.
1/30/17,3,"My car was picked up from work in the morning which was great, but I didn't hear any more from Audi until I went to pick up my keys from my office's reception at 5pm when I finished work, but they weren't there. I then had to phone my fleet management company who gave me Audi's number to call, so when I called Audi at 17.06, I was told they were on their way, but they didn't know how long they would be and I had to wait until they dropped the keys off at about 17.20. Audi never thought to call me to explain there might be a delay and how long I might have to wait."
1/30/17,5,"David was brilliant. Turned up on Saturday afternoon for a test drive, had the correct car I wanted to test drive ready. The thing that stood out the most, was the fact David did not try to sell me anything I did not want, as I already had quite a clear picture of what I was after so it made the process as quick as possible. Couldn't recommend David Willis enough, all down to the customer service."
1/30/17,5,"My car was finally going in for the Emissions and I also booked the car in for a service. I explained I would need a courtesy car whilst my car was in. I had just sat down in the waiting area when I was called. The handover took less that 5 minutes and I was on my way. The service I received was fantastic and would still recommend VW to my friends. When my car was ready I got a courtesy call from Chris W, very polite and when the courtesy car was returned, again the handover was a smooth transition. Car serviced and valeted. Thanks Claire"
1/30/17,5,"We attended the VIP event and within a week i brought my car home.
Really pleased with the customer service and how quick the turn around was!"
1/29/17,5,"My experience with Audi is the best I've had at any car dealership. The guy who sold me the car was very friendly, kept me up to-date and my car arrived just 10 days after purchasing."
1/29/17,4,The team was very good. The service was good. So satisfied
1/28/17,5,Excellent experience - friendly efficient service
1/27/17,5,Very good and caring service from VW Inchcape Macclesfield
1/27/17,5,"I visited the Coopers of York, with looking for an preowned X5, my first contact was with Phil Morfitt, their tech chapI I have to say he had the knowledge that supports the sales team. He was more than willing to show me and explain the vehicles features.
Subsequently, I was introduced to Tim Green, (Sales) again first impressions, he listened and we built the interaction, he sources my vehicle from up north and arranged for to come to York.
It was driven and it was purchased, couple of issues on tyre balance were resorted without issue my workstop Manager.
Swift and .smooth
If you want a BMW go have a look, they will sort a vehicle to your requirements."
1/27/17,5,"Just completed the purchase of a new Audi at Cheshire Oaks. The deal was concluded in under a week and Stuart was fantastic all the way through he process. It was a quick, seamless purchase and we are delighted with the new car and deal we received."
1/27/17,5,"Having just purchased a new A6, I wanted to praise Inchcape Bolton and salesman Neil for the professional way they contacted me about their special sales event, and helped me to find the most competitive deal that I think I could have found anywhere.

The choice of vehicles and ease in knowing what my financial outlay would be for different choices of car was really excellent and made it simple for me to find a deal to suit our budget.

Neil was in constant contact with us during the sale process and this went smoothly right up to picking up our new car."
1/26/17,5,"After a couple of hiccups over the availabilty of a particular vehicle, Cooper eventually found me a beautiful M240i with some fabulous extras.
From the moment you enter the showroom, the friendly reception staff are there to greet you and to assist. The sales team are extremely friendly, attentive and knowledgeable, and even the General Manager offered his assistance. All in all, a wonderful experience and a competitive deal too.
Thank you, Cooper Teesside!"
1/26/17,5,Every visit to Cooperbmw provides a consistent level of customer service which is greatly appreciated. Attention to detail is always great and staff are professional but in a friendly manner. Thanks.
1/26/17,5,"I was approached by Inchcape Audi at Cheshire Oaks as my previous vehicle was coming to the end of a 4 year PCP. The Sales Exec, Amy, was incredibly helpful, diligent and professional. She sourced a suitable, new vehicle and the required specification within a financial deal that suited all concerned. The car was delivered on time and as expected with the whole process taking less than 3 weeks. I would recommend Cheshire Oaks Audi and especially Amy in Sales.

See you in 3 years!!"
1/26/17,5,"Having booked in for a service early, the staff were waiting when I arrived.
While my service was completed (in a very reasonable length of time) I was given a superb cup of coffee while I waited reading a paper.
In what seemed like no time, my car was ready, it was also washed & vacuumed through!!!
All staff were extremely polite and pleasant and what had been done to my car was clearly explained to me by Mr Robinson.
All in all a good experience and I would have no hesitation in recommending Coopers to all my friends."
1/26/17,5,"Excellent response from dealership,i recommend this dealership to anyone."
1/26/17,5,Beyond any sensible criticism. Well done!
1/26/17,5,"Expertly looked after at Swindon Audi, so pleased with all the customer service and of course the car itself. Many thanks."
1/26/17,5,"All staff at this dealership treat you with respect and in a timely fashion, from the parking attendant to the sales staff, the car is always washed and vacuumed on return. They make you feel special, that's a hard thing to find these days. We pay a lot of money for a prestige marque and they seem to understand that and make you welcome."
1/25/17,5,"Having thought about buying a car for many thoughts it was time to put thoughts into action. Making the BMW dealership in Croydon my preferred option.
We viewed the high spec, finely tuned, highly polished vehicles on the forecourt in awesome.
Grant Jones and his manager Lee were our sales specialist. Both being efficient; knowledgeable; accommodating and fair.
After making our final decision we finalised papers over an almond slice and a cup of coffee.
BMW Cooper Croydon should be your dealeeship of choice if you want to buy your car hassle free.
Well done guys!!!"
1/25/17,5,Just purchased a used vehicle from Cooper Cobham. An excellent experience from the test drive till driving the vehicle away a week later: felt like they listened to what I was looking for an delivered exactly what I wanted. Sales team were welcoming and I felt very genuine. Thanks especially go to Jack Bristow.
1/25/17,5,This the 2nd time I have used Coopers BMW Colchester and the service I received was excellent. Offering a wuw service with free coffee and Wi-Fi let's you get on with your work with the min disruption to your day.
1/25/17,3,"I put my car in to get the emissions scandal stuff sorted out. During the booking phase on the phone the Gent that dealt with me was very professional and asked if I needed anything else doing. I asked if I could have a service done on my A4 at the same time which he arranged. During the service checks they found my brake discs worn, which I expected, and they called to see if I wanted the work done which I agreed to. Upon collection of the car I had to wait a couple of minutes to be seen to and the young lad was also professional and quickly sorted me out. The car was cleaned inside and out and I was happy with the work on my 2 mile journey back home in the evening. However, 3 days later when I drove my 30 mile commute in Freezing Fog I realised that during the service they had topped up my window wash fluid with what seemed to be water as the screen wash bottle had frozen solid (The first time that's happened in the 7 years I've owned the car). Barely being able to see out of the windscreen was bad enough but the car also started misting up even with the aircon on auto, this didn't happen before I put the car into the garage for the work. So overall, I was impressed by the front end staff but feel a bit let down with the engineering side of things, especially after a £800 bill."
1/25/17,5,"From the time of entering the premises ( guided parking) we were greeted and made to feel welcome. Nothing was too much trouble , the whole process of changing our car was dealt with by Grant the Sales excecutive. There was no pressure, only genuine concern that our requirements were met . We were made to feel valued customers by all the staff we spoke to. Grant was able to sort out any problems we had, and was informative and knowledgable about the car . We travelled 200 miles to buy our chosen car from this dealership, and found it to be a pleasant and rewarding experience from start to finish , the car Was filled up with petrol for our journey home which was a thoughtful touch. I would throughly recommend this dealership , especially dealing with Grant. P.s. The coffee in the showroom was first class , and served in proper cups."
1/25/17,5,"From my 1st visit to Cooper BMW, to the time I collected my X6 M50d Sport, I was treated to a very professional and courteous experience. I would recommend them to everyone. And the car is a dream."
1/25/17,5,The first service for my Tiguan was completed efficiently and was on time for collection. Ian O'Sullivan booked me in and rang when completed after sending me a video of the safety check.
1/25/17,5,Excellent service and information given
1/25/17,5,Everything was done in good time with easy booking in and out. The car was fully valeted. My bonnet which was not quite square but was adjusted without this being on the list of things to do. Excellent. Staff are friendly and helpful.
1/24/17,5,"Always excellent work carried out on my car, staff at Cooper BMW Cobham very friendly easy to talk to.My car always returned to me clean inside and out..."
1/24/17,5,"Other than having difficultly finding the place the first time. the customer service was excellent, regular communications and great finance plan."
1/23/17,5,"We bought a new Audi in 2005, so impressed with the vehicle and Customer Service, we bought new again in 2008. Again, the vehicle did not disappoint but it's the Customer Service received that keeps us coming back to Audi. Nothing is too much trouble, right down to being able to drop the vehicle off on a Sunday so our working week is not disrupted, a loan vehicle is always offered where possible and when the vehicle is dropped back to us the valet that our car has received is second to none. There are many ""Top Draw"" brands that we could buy in to but because of the continual excellent Customer Service and of course, the superb engineering of our Audi, I very much doubt we will will buying anything else other than another Audi within the future. (I do have my eye on the new R8 V10 but my husband says I have to behave myself)"
1/23/17,4,"Was pleased with Zoe who dealt with me, she was very welcoming and happy to help. I did mention that I only have 10 minutes as had to drop my son off to school and she managed this well. Overall really pleased and would visit again because of her."
1/23/17,5,"The mini services department couldn't have been more helpful! A few issues came up with my Mini as a part was out of stock, but they managed to find and fit it on the same day."
1/23/17,4,We dealt with Karl and Diana and both were excellent No hard sell and we had two relaxed test drives. Love the car and all expectations met so far. Also very happy with the trade-in value for our BMW X3. Thanks to Mini TD!
1/23/17,5,Good service and advice from start to finish thank you
1/23/17,5,Good service well trained and knowledgeable people
1/23/17,5,"Excellent service I get my car back very much on time staff was friendly, definitely recommend:)"
1/22/17,5,"Following an emergency visit to Volkswagen Altrincham due to a punctured tyre, Lisa could not have been more helpful. I didn't have an appointment, it was extremely busy, despite this they found the time to change my tyre. The tyre insurance I took out with them when I purchased the car was definitely worth it for ease and peace of mind. The car was fully valeted inside and out following the tyre change. Thank you. Karl Furnival, Sale."
1/21/17,5,I arrived early at Volkswagen Chelmsford they just did my job straight away I can't thank them enough top dealership cheers Joseph

1/20/17,5,Good and a reasonable time waiting
1/19/17,5,Brilliant service and all the staff were polite and thoughtful. Kept me informed throughout the day of work carried out on the car . Excellent love going to them.
1/19/17,5,"The JCT600 Mercedes Experience: (AWFUL)
Rang JCT600 Mercedes York to ask about a few models, young receptionist was very polite and interested. Took some details and said she would get them to call me back. Decided an hour and a half later that I would pop over as I had some spare time and rang to be courteous enough as not to get them to ring me as I would be 'on my way'. She said that they would be happy to help and that they had sales advisers available. I totally understood that this may involve waiting if sales advisers were with another customer. Was met at reception my a different lady who basically looked down her nose at me and although I felt like having to 'push her forward' a little or 'prompt' her that I actually wanted to spend money seemed to be the least of her worries. She did ask if I could come back and make an appointment for another day; at which I explained my previous telephone call. She then proceeded to ask around to see what sales person would next be available. I wasn't then greeted in the most warming of welcomes for the second time and the attitude that I felt from both of them was that they really could not be bothered. After explaining myself again after already speaking to the receptionist about my requirements, he took me to his desk and talked me through a couple of models. After about 3 minutes looking on his system, he basically said that he didn't have anything and he could take my details. I did push a little further, explaining about what I had to spend and also mentioned CLA Class at around 190bhp (ish), so anything like that would be worth looking at. (At this point I would like to mention that they had a White CLA 220 CDI which is about 175bhp (ish) on the forecourt). He started to perk up a little and gave me his card if I wanted to contact him regarding an online build of a new car and just to give me the reference number from the website.

BMW Experience: (AMAZING)
I left it at that and then drove around the corner to BMW. I already had one and although Mercedes was the change I was looking for, I was greeted so warm and friendly by the staff - every one of them, that I ended up test driving two cars and thanks to Tom, Tim & the Management on duty the Sunday closed the deal on a brand new BMW 420d M Sport worth just over £40k. Your loss JCT600 and let's just say I will never, ever look at a Mercedes again or ever recommend either JCT600 or Mercedes to any family, friends or relatives for life. You have a lot to learn!

CooperBMW York - Thank you and well done - I will recommend your services, professionalism and will be back later this year for my partners new car."
1/19/17,5,"First class experience in delivering my nearly new x6 with a well priced px for my existing merc 4x4.

All staff friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.

Would definitely recommend."
1/19/17,5,"Easy to book with the service department.
Car was ready in when I was told it would be and bonus of being washed and vacuumed.

Upgraded to a service package to include next years service, with a great deal on price!

See you next year!"

1/19/17,5,Car was serviced quickly leaving me without a car for only a short space of time. Staff were polite and very clear with there report.
1/18/17,5,"Digital readings incorrect so booked the car (Polo) in. Efficient booking, no time wasted holding on etc. Received phone call day before appointment to make sure everything arranged. Saw Matthew at Service Desk. He went through paperwork and said would call when ready. Friendly, efficient service, no waiting around. Picked up car - it was something I had done, nothing wrong with car....Matthew showed me the features which I had missed and asked if I needed help with anything else, made sure I was happy. The car had been valeted which was a nice surprise. I was very pleased with the service I received."

1/17/17,5,Very helpful and efficient. Professional and friendly.
1/16/17,5,People that go above and beyond to help customers...excellent
1/16/17,5,"Having been an Audi owner for many years there was no question that the next car would also be an Audi, but which one! My wife and I narrowed our choice down to two, an A4 Avant, or a Q5. A visit to east Kent Audi & speaking to Samantha Riggott helped to make up our minds. After a test drive in both, the Q5 won the day. We discussed what the car would mainly be used for & how many miles per annum we drove, so that she was able to advise on the right model for us. There was some negotiation over the trade in price of our current vehicle, an agreement was reached & we became the proud owners of a Glacier White Q5 S Line +! We felt that the whole experience was enjoyable & not at all pressurised. I would most definitely recommend East Kent Audi.. and the bottle of champagne was a most unexpected & nice touch, thank you!"
1/16/17,5,Received a great welcome again also a great service and a replacement BMW while parts were ordered for my vehicle kept up to date with progress always made to feel comfortable good coffee as well
1/16/17,5,Excellent service. Well looked after by all the staff.
1/16/17,5,This company makes your experience as enjoyable as possible. Everyone you come into contact with is friendly and knowledgeable.
1/16/17,5,Van came into for its mot & I wanted to discuss about changing the van for a newer model. The staff were friendly & helpful in all departments. Would recommend this dealership to anybody.
1/16/17,4,Very efficient all round.
1/15/17,4,A pleasant experience this time using Coopers unlike our last experience with a problem with the Drive Train which took a little sorting out and at a cost otherwise a good company to use
1/15/17,5,"Booked an appointment online, which was then followed up by a telephone call from the garage confirming details.
Waited whilst it was dealt with, offered free beverage and kept up to date all the while.
I loved the video healthcheck that was sent to my mobile, as the underneath of the vehicle and behind the wheels were shown, something which you would never get to see normally, A very clever idea."
1/14/17,1,"Great service,easy to book. Will next time check out about the option of having the Waite whilst service is carried out,not always possible if works are labour heavy.
From leaving and collecting the car I was kept informed through out.
Many thanks,
M,Harber"
1/14/17,5,I booked my car in for a service. Was completed satisfactorily. Staff were very cooperative and friendly. Would certainly recommend.
1/13/17,1,rang you cooper Bmw york asked for (Danny redpath ) twice never rang back I want to change my car but with no one interested in York I'll try teeside next
1/13/17,5,"I have never felt so important and thanks to the staff in Coopers Thames Ditton I felt I was treated like I had spent a million dollars.
The way the order was processed and the continual updates whilst the car was being built then the presentation in a glass room with a satin cover over it, whipped off to present the car to me was just breathtaking.
Not once was I put under pressure to buy the car and the professionalism of the team was just wonderful.
This is not the first time I have been to Coopers Thames Ditton nor will it be the last. JY Surbiton."
1/13/17,5,"Dealt with very quickly comfortable surroundings whilst I waited beverages on tap, courtesy wash thank you Cooper minI Chelmsford"
1/12/17,5,"Having been recommended to Hunters. Southampton by friends, I took delivery of my new Range Rover Sport this week from Phil Haygreen. What a pleasure to deal with Hunters.
From initial contact with Nick, demo car for the day and Land Rover forward thinking technologies explained and a good deal. I was tempted away from German competitor whom I had used for many years. Phil’s valued advice when selecting colour, trim and extras to make this car all things to me, workhorse, versatile, luxury travel with off road capabilities for my rural area.
Kept informed by Phil & Sales Manager ‘Kam’ during build and delivery process. Even a short video clip emailed on the morning of delivery giving a glimpse of the car.
Handover a truly memorable experience. Member of staff parked our car as we arrived, Leila served coffee and delicious muffins and Phil did the most thorough handover I’ve ever experienced, no rushing and everything setup and explained.
Even the smart keys with Land Rover key rings presented in an attractive box.
The 135 mile round trip well worth it for this kind of service. Thanks to Kam, Phil, Nick, Leila and workshop/valet team.
25th Feb
This past week I took my 6 week old Range Rover Sport back to get a minor issue, with the infotainment system sorted. The fault partially my fault. Outstanding service from Service Department from booking the appointment to collection. Phone call the previous evening checking the appointment was still convenient and on schedule from Hunters side. Sukh on reception already knew about the problem from the technician and Phil who had taken a look at it when I was passing a couple of weeks previously. Loan car, all cleaned ready and waiting for me after being served coffee and muffin by the ever helpful reception/hospitality staff. Confirmation the following day, all sorted and Sukh arranged for himself and the technician to explain and demonstrate the solution. Not like some dealers giving you a number box to plonk on top of the car and no explanation of work on completion. My car had been valeted and it brought back memories of that first drive home. Overall, delighted in every respect, even the combined mpg figures are achievable and I have exceeded them at times. The Winter Hibernot event also demonstrated Hunters commitment to extending ownership for customers. Everyone just works as a team. A dealership for JLR to be proud of."
1/12/17,5,Excellent buying experience - not pushy and very knowledgeable. Would recommend (in fact have done)...
1/12/17,4,"They were very good and my car was booked in within 5 days of reporting my tyre problem. They sent me a video showing me the problem with my tyre ( never had that from any other car dealers from previous cars Ive owned ) which I thought was really good. Reason I didn't give 5 stars is, when I brought the car I took out a tyre insurance which doesnt cover the cost of the tyres that are on my car. I was lead to believe that taking out the insurance would have covered the cost of replacing the tyre, not leaving me to then having to pay the shortfall"
1/12/17,5,Great customer service whilst getting my Mini Cooper serviced. Work was done within a day and I was updated on the car's progress. TLC package is good value for money.
1/12/17,5,"Really good service from the service taem, especially the service manager Dave and the receptionist Joanne."
1/12/17,5,"Travelled down from Birmingham to view a vehicle and if happy drive back same day and this was achieved which was great. David was their to greet us and go through some information then a test drive, all good then a bit of negotiation and sale concluded
Had to give them time exploring to prepare the vehicle and then on our way. Would recommend their service"
1/12/17,5,"I have been a customer here for the past seven years and nothing is too much trouble for the service staff. From day one they have been professional and very friendly, which in itself is a winner in any service industry. From sales to service Coopers offer an excellent service."
1/12/17,5,"Bought a car from Damien,
I traveled by train from Glasgow and was picked up at Stockport train station by Damien.
Damien and the team at Hyde Audi could not do enough and the service I received was exceptional. There was no ""Hard Sell"", everything was explained well and the car I bought was immaculate and I had a great drive home to Glasgow!
I would buy from Damien and the team at Hyde Audi again in the future and would recommend going to Hyde Audi if you are in the market for a new car.

Thanks to Damien and the team at Hyde Audi"
1/11/17,5,"The personal touch that Crawley Audi service dept. provide is simply very warming.
You made to feel like you actually matter, from the moment you speak to reception, who greets you with a warm smile and offers you either a hot or cold beverage.
Service representative Daisy Sutton provided me with incredible service, explaining every aspect of the job for me to be ""more than satisfied"".
I must also add the great work the technicians do on the car.
I am very happy with Crawley Audi."
1/10/17,5,"Making the appointment was easy and they fitted my car in for a service within 4 days. Once in the showroom I was greeted and made to feel comfortable and relaxed. I love the complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits. I received follow up calls so I always knew what was happening."
1/10/17,5,"Recently had my car in for the emissions update. Level of service was excellent, delivered by polite professional staff. Made to feel at home during the experience.
In the future when it's time to replace/update my Audi I will be going to Swindon Audi for the advice and possibly purchase."
1/10/17,4,Very good service from the outset many thanks Team VW
1/10/17,2,"I was warned about Maidstone Audi by a friend who has now ordered his R8 elsewhere due to his experiences, but as my local dealer and getting a good price I went ahead and ordered my wife a new Q3. I have now phoned almost daily for two weeks to find out the status of my car which has not arrived when I was told it would, it seems to have been sitting in Spain for the last two weeks and is causing me real problems as we sold the previous car. Inchcape are telling me a different story to Audi UK. No one ever, ever phones back when requested day after day, often several times a day. I also keep getting a voicemail telling me there is no one to take my call even during the middle of a business day and when I try to leave a message it often just cuts off and you have to start all over again. I advised them months ago when trying to place an order and it is no different. I've learned my lesson, and when I replace my main car with an S5 cab in the spring it will be sourced elsewhere."
1/10/17,5,10 out 10 very good to deal with
1/9/17,4,"Took my Mini Countryman in for its 1st service, staff were all polite, friendly & the cappuccino was much appreciated!"
1/9/17,5,"Such superb customer service from Alex at the Chelmsford dealership, we both felt like our sale mattered to what we wanted. My first BMW experience with a 235iM what a great test drive too, not rushed and such a great chap to give me the information we wanted, oh and the tea was tasty too!"
1/9/17,5,Good all round experience from booking to picking up
1/9/17,5,good service will use again
1/9/17,5,Great service and staff with reasonable prices.
1/9/17,5,"5 Star service. Was looked after from start to finish. Daniel's knowledge of VW products and services was remarkable. Thanks again, Allan"
1/8/17,5,My car was serviced by Mercedes Liverpool and I have to say the service was fantastic. There was a slight problem after the service yet I spoke to Paul Kelly who was great . He sorted out the problem with no inconvenience to myself and the technician who came to my place of work to sort it out was fantastic
1/8/17,4,"We were greeted very nicely by the salesman and treated with courtesy and respect. He understood what we were looking for and put together the right car, without adding any unnecessary items, although letting us know what other options there were. The only slight quibble we had was that it was difficult to get a definitive price until we were committed to buying. We needed to know the price before we could commit to purchasing. But we got there in the end and the sales team could not have been nicer."
1/7/17,5,Purchased Passat CC from the Altrincham beach. Adam was very helpful and efficient in the organisation of the sale. Very pleased with the process and obviously the car itself!
1/6/17,5,Gave an excellent service enabling me to make the right choice for my next car. Showed good understanding of my requirements and the market - consistent and improved on the enquiries I had started. Fully answered my questions. Not pushy but confident they could give me the deal I was looking for. Elaine particularly to be commended.
1/6/17,5,"Purchased a new Golf R from Inchcape Chester.
Had a comprehensive and no pressure test drive on different performance Golfs to establish which, if any, would fulfill my requirements. Settled on a Golf R DSG ( there's a surprise ) and then Inchcape matched the best internet quote for a new one to my spec. Throughout, the salesman, Chris Sault, proved very knowledgeable about the car ( believe me, not always a given ); and kept me posted regularly throughout the waiting period. The car was delivered faultlessly and on time.
No surprise but I am delighted with the car which is praise coming from a serial BMW owner.
Martin Baxter"
1/6/17,5,Purchased two cars in two weeks and you'd expect they'd be happy for my business. In each of the contacts/meetings/conversations I had I got the impression - certainly from the salesman I dealt with - that they were more interested in doing the right thing than any dealer/car seller I've used before. Jack was very good and I'd certainly buy a car from them again.
1/6/17,5,"Great customer service, full information, facts and openness. Car provided as required and on time at short notice with great financing package"
1/6/17,5,"Recently purchased a new Up from VW Swindon. The service I received was absolutely excellent, with Sales Executive Micky Newman allowing us to have a test drive and explaining all the details of the Up range to us prior to us making a decision. Ultimately, we decided on a High Up model and are extremely pleased with our purchase. Micky organised all the paperwork and arranged to have our old part-exchange vehicle collected.
I cannot praise the service I received from Inchcape Swindon highly enough and would thoroughly recommend them!"
1/6/17,5,"My visit to Mercedes at Liverpool (Pall Mall) must be one of the most positive memorable experiences for a Main Dealer to date. My contact Craig Williams was courteous, polite, and very knowledgeable of the brand. I took my car in for a mystery fault on my car that I was convinced was there but couldn’t really explain what it was and a SAT Nav update. Left my car with Craig and waited for a call which I expected in turn would cost me a small ransom to put the problem right, how wrong was I. Mercedes put the car on the diagnostics machine and found there was nothing wrong with the vehicle. I received the call and was pleasantly surprised that I would not be charged for this even though I was told before I went to the Dealership it would cost me to have a diagnostic check. Sat Nav was updated, I paid my fees for this and collected my car which incidentally was cleaned (nice touch).
Fantastic service from a Main Dealer, lovely showroom and environment, free coffee if you want it, reception called me a taxi to get to work and car was ready same day for pick up as agreed in the morning. What is not to like about this Dealership, I will definitely be going back for all my servicing and anything else my Mercedes needs in the future.
Thank you Mercedes at Liverpool, you have restored my faith that there are Dealerships out there that are professional motor dealers that listen to the customer and are not out for the big buck whenever they can take it from you."
1/6/17,5,Bought two cars from here and will continue to go back. Thanks to all staff especially Kim!!
1/5/17,4,"The staff at the Basingstoke branch of inchcapetoyota where very helpfull and friendly. I brought a RAV4 hybrid from them which was a ex-demo
And I am very pleased with the car.
The manager of the branch KAREN was the most helpfull of them all.
Only one concern was they did not show me how all the gadgets worked or how to upgrade the sat.nav."
1/5/17,5,Helpful salesman guided me to pare registered polo and was able to drive it away 2 days later. Very smooth hassle free purchase.
1/5/17,5,"They provided an excellent seevice when I recently bought my new bmw, the fourth bmw I have bought from them"
1/5/17,5,"I was on the lookout for a used BMW 1 Series car and Cooper BMW was one of the outlets that interested me. Right from the time I landed in the used car section Dan Markham, the sales person was there right through the process. Rather than selling he helped me make the right choice of the car and wasn't pushy at all. All positives and negatives of certain models were explained and it was like taking my trusted friend to buy a car. Even the other people I met across various floors were very courteous and helpful. The car, The customer service and the whole buying experience was too good!.. Thank you!"
1/5/17,5,Picked up my new car on 30-Dec-16 and as usual totally hassle free and a delightful experience. This is my 4th car from Inchape Swindon and would thoroughly recommend them.
1/5/17,5,"Yet another 5 star performance at Audi Maidstone.
Car ready on time, all works effected.
Always kept appraised of matters...
Keep up the good work.."
1/3/17,5,"excellent customer service, from friendly and knowledgeable staff. would highly recommend this dealership. all staff are very courteous and helpful"
1/3/17,5,"Intermittent ABS warning lights resulted in a service visit to replace ABS sensor/Discs/Pads which was handled extremely well by Service Advisor George and Technician Phil; I was looked after very well, was provided with regular updates and would not hesitate recommending VW Inchcape Chelmsford to others considering them. PS. The video emailed to me helped me understand the repairs and why they were needed. Five stars!"
1/3/17,5,"Sean Hughes was the most helpful car salesman I have had the pleasure of dealing with. From the time I contacted him to walking into the showroom the staff were so helpful.

Small local dealer with passion. Well worth a visit, for a great Mercedes-Benz.

I travelled across the pennines from Ossett, West Yorkshire to buy from this salesman and dealer."
1/3/17,5,I was treated professionally and courteously from start to finish. Took the hassle out of my Part Ex and made the whole experience of passing over hard earnt cash a pleasure! I would highly recommend requesting Jon McCall if purchasing a new vehicle - A good honest chap that follows through on his promises and goes the extra mile!
1/3/17,5,"The Salesman that I dealt with was excellent and could not do enough to assist me in the purchase of my Jaguar XF sport brake.
All the other staff I came into contact with were also very polite and helpful.
Thanks
Terry Whitham"
1/3/17,5,"Great service, right car and a good price was agreed. The preparation team helped to turnaround our new Z4 in hours which was terrific and allowed us to go on our New Years adventure in a new car.....Thanks Ian and Paul at Coopers."
1/3/17,5,From start to finish the service received was fantastic!
1/2/17,4,I think my booking hadnt been put in the previous week so turned up for service and there was no paperwork. I was asked if I'd moved the appointment which I hadn't. Was dealt with swiftly and car was fit in. Lady was friendly throughout

1/2/17,5,"This was my first time buying a new car. Tetbury Audi were fantastic. Not at all pushy but made sure I was aware of all info/options. They went into detail about what I could get for my budget and I ended up with a stunning Audi TT that I'm over the moon with. The service from start to finish was excellent - can't recommend enough. I got an unveiling of my new car, a gift and a personal welcome /congratulations sign - the details really make you feel part of something special. Thanks Tetbury Audi... see you in 3 years :-)"

From choosing the car to picking it up everything went smoothly and there were touches that made us feel very much like valued customers, like being picked up from the train station when we went to collect & the special handover including video clip that was sent. Our salesman, Simon Barker was helpful, friendly and polite throughout the process & I would not hesitate to recommend him."

Thank you to all the team. Especially faith to listening intently to my small issue that was resolved.
A fantastic service and I look forward to visiting again soon"
12/30/16,5,"Very, very hard to fault Hunters Guildford after we have bought our fourth Land Rover from them. In my sceptical view, the staff could hardly have been more engaging and helpful (though at the age of 71 I do NOT approve of being addressed by one senior figure as ""young man"" - but I recognise that bad habits can form easily, and be hard to shake off). That apart - well done them. Highly recommended."
12/30/16,5,Excellent service from Nick & Will
12/30/16,5,"Very straight forward experience, friendly service that never felt pressurised. I had a car in mind and they took the time to explain, show me it's features without making me feel that we were ever being forced to purchase the vehicle. Picking the car up was easy, and the special treatment of the separate room where the car is stored made you feel like the purchase was something to be enjoyed."
12/30/16,5,The service I received at mini Chelmsford was excellent. I saw the car I purchased at another dealership some distance away and the sales executive Luke Avenell was so helpful and arranged to have the car transferred over to Chelmsford for me. He was very friendly and knowledgeable and went through everything I needed to know about the car with enthusiasm and care making sure I was happy and understood all that he explained. This is the second mini I have bought from this dealership and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a mini.
12/30/16,5,"Very happy with my dealings at H A Fox Guildford
Al went smoothly and well presented. When I need a new car, I know where to go."
12/29/16,5,Great experience with personable and reliable staff! Would highly recommend.
12/29/16,5,"Staff were very helpful, especially Matt Walker. The process was smooth and as easy as possible."
12/29/16,4,i love the experience of finally having a Mercedez but Im still gutted why i didn't get the sport or AMG version of my car
12/28/16,5,"This is my second BMW from Cooper Thames Ditton, their service is excellent and this car, so far, is even sweeter than the last one!"
12/28/16,5,My sales person R Miotti was the most helpful car salesman I have had dealings with over all the years of buying a car. From the time I walked into the showroom the staff were so helpful.
12/28/16,5,Excellent service from BMW Cooper in Croydon. Chris Gomes was very helpful and honest throughout the whole process. I would definitely recommend this dealer and Chris. I was very busy over the Xmas period however Chris managed to get the car in and ready for collection around my schedule.
12/28/16,5,"I just took delivery of a M140i. Alex Beattie, 'my' sales executive was tremendous throughout the process. He worked hard to source two vehicles from different dealers in the group to test drive different combinations before I made a decision. He then kept me informed during the build process, until delivery.

12/28/16,5,Great service
12/28/16,5,"The staff, especially Jovino, were extremely helpful and buying my second hand golf was very smooth
Cathy"
12/28/16,5,Great people and Service. Always happy to explain what is going on and good updates during service.
12/27/16,5,"My Wife and I were fortunate to have Mr Andy Waterfield help us with the purchase of a new car. He managed the transaction in a very detailed, friendly and professional manner which made the choice of car very easy. During the delivery process of the car again Andy explained everything in a very detailed and professional manner which resulted in my wife driving the car away with a very big smile! Oh and yes the BMW X1 is a great car"
12/27/16,5,The excellent customer care and service offered by Hunters makes the additional cost of main dealer servicing worth the extra. I purchased my Land Rover in July and have nothing but high praise for all the team at Brock.
12/27/16,5,I found my experience of buying a car from inchcape vw a very good experience from start to finish I was made welcome the salesman Brian Cookson was very helpful in every way his knowledge was excellent on the Tiguan range. He was very helpful with the finance side as well.on collection of my car I was very happy with the experience the hand over was very good all aspects of the car was shown to me before I drove it out of the showroom. I would recommend inchcape to any of my friends or family if they where thinking of changing there car.
12/26/16,5,Excellent customer service. Brilliant car. Best shopping experience I've ever had!
12/26/16,5,"Tom O'Brien was one of the most sincere, honest salesmen I've ever met. More often than not, I feel intimidated by other salesmen but Tom spoke to us like human beings, made us feel welcome and therefore enticed me to buy, compared to other cars I'd seen, testdriven and liked through other manufacturers. Excellent service from day 1, right through until aftersales and am thoroughly happy with my experience at Inchcape Volkswagen. Would definitely recommend to anyone to see Tom, particularly, if looking to buy a Volkswagen."
12/26/16,5,"Due to heavy demand I was told that there were no courtesy cars on the day my car was in for service but as I was forewarned I decided I was happy to sit in the showroom and admire the stunning cars. I was looked after I you come to expect from Jaguar now and the staff couldn't do enough for me. The service was excellent quality and the video review sent by email as the service was taking place is a great idea.

Once the car was washed and keys handed back to me, I was helped with my bag back to the car. Again 1st class service.

If I had not decided before, I will be buying the next Jaguar here."
12/26/16,5,"Excellent experience when buying a new car. David Hudson was great, he kept me up to date and delivered my car sooner than expected."
12/26/16,5,"This is the second BMW I have bought from this company. The salesperson took time to 'build' me several cars, explaining all options. I am allergic to overselling so it was pleasing that there was no element of the hard sales pitch."
12/26/16,5,"The service I received from Rob Turner , sales advisor at named dealerships was fantastic. At no point did I feel pressured into purchasing my used-approved 1 series. Rob sourced my vehicle from a Coopers branch in Ipswich which was hassle free and straightforward. The vehicle is in fantastic condition and presented beautifully. My shift work prevented me from visiting the dealership on certain days , Rob came in on his day off to accommodate my work pattern. The staff at Cobham are inviting , informative and professional , from the reception stafff through to sales. I look forward to the high standard of care for my vehicles service and would highly recommend this dealership to friends and family. Massive thanks to Rob and the Cobham team."

12/24/16,5,"I recently purchased a Mini from Cooper Malton. I received a very warm welcome on arriving at the site and did not feel pressured. Carl provided an excellent service throughout the process without being pushy. I would, and have already, recommend Cooper Malton (and in particular Carl) to friends and colleagues who may be looking to purchase a Mini. I was originally hesitant due to loving my existing car, however, now love my Mini too!"

12/23/16,5,"I was very impressed by your sales staff, both in terms of the warm welcome and their level of knowledge about the BMW range. I have been looking at approved used cars from a range of manufacturers, but I must say that their friendly manner and ability to match my requirements with a range of choices from was frankly excellent and stands you apart from your main rivals. Jeremy Allen really helped me both with the choice of car and with the finance and insurance packages, and now it's been delivered not only was the experience positive but I am really happy with the deal and the car itself. Outstanding."
12/23/16,5,"Our personal Service Team Leader, looked after us from start to finish. Really courteous and professional job - well done!"
12/22/16,5,"I booked my 15 plate Mini Cooper in for the advertised winter health check with free umbrella (at the Ipswich dealership). I booked a curtesy car whilst mine was being pampered. On arrival, the staff greeted me in a friendly manner and we swapped over cars in speedy time. My car was given a spa service and looked amazing when I picked her up again. All the winter checks completed and fluids topped up. And I received the free branded Mini umbrella as promised ....which is fab! All in all, I am impressed with the wonderful service from all the staff I encountered at Mini and I have told all my friends about the great customer service. Thank you all ...and MERRY Christmas 🎄 xx"

12/22/16,5,No problems everything went to time and car valeted
12/22/16,5,"Was very impressed with the service I received from the moment I arrived to when I picked my car up. The staff were friendly and efficient and I was very impressed with the addition of the audicam, although I would add the sound quality was not good at all. Fortunately for me it was just an opportunity for me to see that all was good with the wheels, tyres and brakes. Good value for money also; would always prefer for my car to be serviced by audi and this makes it possible as it is affordable. Definitely and surprisingly would recommend."
12/22/16,5,Very pleased with my experience at VW Inchcape Exeter. Very helpful & knowledgeable staff.
12/22/16,5,"Did not see my car till they sent me the video mark said I have a car for you and I was not disappointed excellent service right thought and going the extra mile.
Regards
Murray"
12/21/16,5,"decided to have a winter health check on my golf gti and i found out what a brilliant service this is. not only were all my fluid levels topped up but the tyres were checked for depth and pressure and the car cleaned inside and out plus i found a little gift of a ice scrapper de icer screen wash and a bottle of rubber care in the boot when i got home.
brilliant and all for 20 quid."
12/21/16,5,"How refreshing to have a great, personal service. I put a deposit on a used Toyota Rav4 over the phone and drove 90 miles up to Derby to test drive it, part exchange and take it away. The car was over and above my expectations and I had a great service from Chris the senior sales person. He made it all easy, smooth and a pleasure. Before I drove away he showed me in detail how everything works, but I know I can call if I have forgotten anything!. I am over the moon with my new car and would recommend Inchcape Toyota most highly."
12/21/16,5,Fantastic Service. Polite helpful front of house staff. Fast efficient service. Followed up by the best ever valet carried out foc. Much appreciated.

12/21/16,5,"Buying a new car from Wirral Inchcape Volkswagen was a positive experience. No hard sell and open negotiation over price.

12/21/16,5,Hassle free. Nik James couldn't have been more helpful. Very professional and efficient.
12/21/16,5,Very friendly helpful staff made you feel welcome and helped me buy the car that I wanted
12/20/16,5,I bought my 1 series convertible from here a year ago. As it approached its MOT the service department called to remind me and arrange the appointment. It went in. It came out. All done in the blink of an eye with no problems. Thank you BMW.
12/20/16,5,Excellent service from initial enquiry to hand over of vehicle. Very professional without the hard sell factor.

12/20/16,4,"Very happy with what was done, except boot was not hoovered.
Shock at needing to pay next month £79 for the air-conditioning re-gas.
Under Motobility paid nearly £3,000 deposit, only used 7500 over 2 years Yet still to find more money for air-conditioning.
Disappointed no one mentioned the timescale for resolving the emissions scandal."
12/19/16,5,As usual the service we received at Mercedes Benz Chester was second to none. We would recommend the company as a whole to all.
12/19/16,5,"Excellent service. Well looked after from dropping off the car in the morning to phone call when promised to let me know all was well and the car ready for collection, to picking up my vehicle. I use Inchcaoe regularly and they have never let me down."
12/19/16,5,Having planned a day looking round different dealerships for a new car we didn't look any further than Mercedes. We would like to say a big thank you to Sarwar for making this such a pleasant experience throughout and one we would highly recommend. Looking forward to many motoring years ahead with Mercedes Benz.

12/19/16,5,"I cannot emphasize enough the importance of customer service in the purchase of what to most people will be the next most expensive purchase of their lives, after a house. Kieren and the team were fantastic throughout. He got me the car I was after for a very good price and in a record-breaking time. Kieren was always quick to respond, accommodated all my requests and was 100% committed to ensure that I was extremely satisfied during the ordering process, throughout the wait for the car, during hand-over, and post-delivery. I am happy to say that despite living 100 miles away, Tetbury Audi will be my go-to Audi dealership."
12/19/16,5,From the time you book your car in to arriving at the reception desk and meeting your adviser the attention and service is first class I just wish other companies provided the same type of customer service that Audi do they make you feel special and important.
12/19/16,5,"Bought a VW Tiguan from Inchcape (West London Volkswagen) last week - although our first visit and purchase, we were made to feel very welcome and considered a valued customer.

Five Star service start to finish.

Well done all!"

Thank you once again Malcolm Maclellan!"
12/19/16,5,My Avensis was recalled under safety recall programme. It took a long time to get hold of the replacement parts (not Inchcape's fault) but when they arrived Inchcape were very flexible in scheduling the work. I elected to wait for the repair to be done and the reception staff were very welcoming and happy to provide me with coffee while I waited. The reception area had an excellent Wi-fi signal so I was able to do useful work while I waited.
12/19/16,5,"Attentive staff, dealt with queries quickly and efficiently."
12/19/16,5,"I wanted a test drive in 2 different Mercedes cars. My local dealer in Leicester arranged a test drive in one car then cancelled the appointment.
The salesman was also indifferent to my requirements. MB Stratford could not have been more helpful from the initial test drive through to delivery. This is customer service how it should be"
12/19/16,5,"We recently purchased a MINI from the Thames Ditton showroom and couldn't be happier with the service received here. We were looked after by Karl and he really pulled out all the stops to find us the perfect car. The after-care has also been incredible. We have no reservations in recommending this showroom to others. This is the first MINI we have owned and it is an incredible and fun drive. If you haven't driven one, arrange a test drive now!!"
12/18/16,5,"Booked to have a bulb replaced (hands too big to fit in the tiny gap to change the bulb!) and came out with replacement BMW!
Livvy (sales executive - Cooper Chelmsford) was knowledgeable and on hand to answer any queries with no pressure tactics. Great environment and a superb customer experience.
Totally satisfied! Will be back when new 5 Series released ..."

12/16/16,5,"It takes a lot to impress me and VW Inchcape in Shrewsbury have done just that. I got some tyres fitted by them the other day and the young lady that looked after me was so nice and a true credit to the company - her name was Ellie Davies (Service Advisor). Thanks also to Steve Richards who fitted the tyres and the gentleman who washed and vacuumed the car afterwards. It truly is the people that make experiences good or bad and VW Inchcape Shrewsbury have got it right!

Kindest regards,

Matt Beharrell."
12/16/16,5,Sincere thanks to Adam Shelton for being so professional who takes his job very seriously but with a great sense of humour! I wish to nominate him for the BMW Employee of the Year!
12/16/16,5,"On arrival I received a friendly greeting and offered a hot drink. A service manager was called and he appeared immediately with the appropriate paperwork for signature. We discussed the work to be done and was given a completion time. On arriving back at Inchcape I found my car ready to drive away. I was greeted by a team member who described the work that had been done, reviewed the results shown on the Visual Safety Report and we discussed any further requirements may have. My car that had been valeted to an amazing standard was awaiting me at the door. Overall excellent service from start to finish. Well done to all involved and thank you."
12/16/16,5,"Been a few months now since we purchased our new VW Golf so time to leave a review of our experience with Inchcape Manchester.

After many months of searching for the best colour, car, spec and off course price we finally found exactly what we were looking for at Inchcape Manchester, the initial contact was promising with fast replies to all emails from the excellent John Mallon, he made contact within 10 minutes of my web enquiry and speedily answered all of our many questions concerning the vehicle, he returned our calls promptly (a real plus in this day and age) and via John A deal was struck to purchase subject to viewing within a couple of hours and the following weekend my partner and I where on our way to Manchester, a six hour round trip, to collect the car.

John met us at the front door, immediately welcomed us and got the coffee's in, great character (think Peter Kay). Great meet and greet.

Now, this is where things start to get a little tricky, whilst the car was in great condition and the test drive went perfectly, on closer inspection there where a couple of things that where not quiet as expected, namely the lack of service history and the two rear tyres where a little closer to the legal limit than I would have liked. We raised these concerns in particular the service history issue and we were introduced to the Sales Manager, Craig Sergeant.

I believe you can only measure a Company when issues and challenges arise and I was immediately impressed that Craig, listened to our issues and reassured us and more importantly took ownership of the concerns that my partner and I had. Craig, looked at various options to make us happy including, discounts from other vehicles but none quiet matched the car we had originally wanted to purchase, so we agreed that Craig would look into our issues fully and report back to us and as we had the 30 day exchange guarantee we agreed to take the car.

Within a week Craig had followed through on all of his promised actions, he had returned calls when he said he would (seems to be a welcome trait at Inchcape) and resolved all of our issues to our complete satisfaction. The term 'exceeding expectations' is much vaunted in the Motor Trade but in my experience this is exactly what Craig delivered.

We have now had the car about 6 months and could not be more pleased with the vehicle and my advise to anyone considering a purchase from Inchcape Manchester is simple, just do it, these guys know and value the meaning of customer service and the biggest compliment and recommendation I can give is that in 3 and a half years time when we are ready to replace our car, Craig will be my first port of call."
12/16/16,5,"I recently purchased a new A-Class from Inchcape, having been a customer of the group for many years. And I can honestly say that the whole buying experience this time with particular reference to my sales contact Richard Helstrom was exemplary.
From initial enquiry to sorting out the bespoke specification to the vehicle handover everything was taken care of, with courtesy, attention to detail and respect. Great service all round."
12/16/16,5,"I recently purchased an approved used E-Class from Inchcape Warrington. The car was first class and drove like new despite being 2 years old. The sales team were very professional and helped me every step of the way.

Chris and his colleagues provided a very professional service and went the extra mile to ensure I was completely satisfied with my purchase. I will definitely be going back to Inchcape for my next vehicle."
12/15/16,5,Fantastic customer service.
12/15/16,5,"Why can't all companies & sales staff provide the level of service and customer care that Jake at Cooper BMW does? No pushiness, outstanding product knowledge, professional, courteous and always keen to go the extra mile. Great job, many thanks."
12/15/16,5,"Booked in for a service, was advised of what the service would entail and the additional benefits. Received a confirmation email of my appointment and the day before Steve gave a courtesy call to remind me of the appointment and check I would be coming.

Arrived at reception, and I was invited to sit in the waiting area, and Steve attended to me very quickly.He was very professional and made me feel welcome and at ease.

I was called 3 hrs later to tell me my car was ready. Upon collecting, I was given a copy of the digital service sheet, and after a chat about the service Steve walked me to my car which was parked right in front of the entrance! VIP treatment.

I was also given some free valeting vouchers and a free breakdown service.
I am very happy with the service offered.
5 stars from me and a full recommendation."
12/15/16,5,"My wife & I have been dealing with Swindon Audi for over 10 years since moving “Down South”. We have always found the Swindon Team to be helpful from Reception staff, Service Dept, Finance to the Sales Executives. The Reception girls have made us very welcome on every visit with coffee, tea & biscuits!! Messages are always passed on & phone calls returned promptly.
Kelly and previously Laura & Spencer, in the Service Dept, have always accommodated our needs & requests, ensuring courtesy cars were available when required & again phone calls are always returned.
Just over 2 weeks ago I purchased a new A3 and my wife a used A1. Phil Bounds, as ever the excellent Sales Executive who always “goes the extra mile”, pulled out all the stops to ensure that both cars could be collected together – which was no mean feat. The A3 transported from the port at Grimsby & the A1 driven from Cheshire Oaks. Many thanks to the drivers who worked very late that night to guarantee delivery to us the next day. Again Phil was on hand to ensure a smooth handover. Any issues highlighted to Phil were sorted at collection, or in the case of the A1, booked in at a later date for minor scuffs & scratches to be rectified. Phil is very conscientious & was determined that ALL issues were sorted to our complete satisfaction & “nothing was too much trouble” – pardon the cliché.
The only issue we had was that the mileage of the A1 on collection was 2000+ more than the mileage advertised & confirmed to my wife by Cheshire Oaks. This was unacceptable to us but this was the fault of the Cheshire Oaks Team. Again Phil was able to offer a solution to this issue which we accepted.
My wife had finance, for the first time ever, on her A1 which was confusing & originally was explained rather too quickly by Dane. We requested and received a more detailed breakdown & explanation from Dane and Jason from Swindon Finance Dept which resolved our issues.
The only issue at Swindon is the lack of parking spaces for customers. However, we would recommend the Swindon Audi Team to friends & family as customers are always guaranteed a warm welcome & excellent service.

12/15/16,5,No problems at all - from making the choice of a new car to signing last paper and driving it off - everything was very smooth. Excellent service
12/15/16,5,Mini were accomodating and very helpful
12/15/16,5,My car servicing was very well organised. I was booked in promptly (reminded via several methods which was useful as I can be very busy and forget!) I was offered several options for conviencence during servicing. Servicing itself was quick but thorough and well handled by the MB team. I particularly liked that my visual inspection was sent straight to my email via video format. My car was returned thoroughly cleaned and I left feeling satisfied with the service. Thank you!
12/15/16,4,"Had problems with new car order, but everything was resolved to the best of their ability and with the least impact on me as the customer. Spent a fair amount of time hanging around when we went to collect the car, but the facilities were pleasant and the staff were generally helpful/friendly - there are definitely worse places to be waiting!"
12/15/16,5,"Had been putting of buying a new car because of fears of a lengthy process with lots of pressure to buy various ""insurances"". Ben at East Kent Audi made it all very straightforward and painless."
12/14/16,3,"I was telephoned by a young lady from H.A. Fox to confirm the date and time of my service booking. unfortunately when I pointed this out, she seemed 1. to disbelieve me, and 2, to be somewhat indignant. she then said she would ""cancel my booking"", and when I again said that it was not my booking, she put the phone down on me!
I subsequently received further text reminders, and finally, two requests to rate my experience of this service booking. I can excuse the original error, we all make mistakes, but the rudeness is difficult to accept.

it is a shame really because a few days earlier I limped into the dealership in my XF with a major malfunction and received excellent treatment including a nearly new XE courtesy car until mine was fixed.

just an off day perhaps?"
12/14/16,5,Very straight forward once I had got the date for the job to be done. Driver who came to pick up the car was very courteous. The additional safety check was very useful.
12/14/16,4,I received fast and efficient service and was personally assisted by Leon corker who made changing my car enjoyable and stress free
12/14/16,5,"The attitude of the staff was very good and efficient. No messing about with sales patter and the like when I just wanted a job done. I mentioned that there was a slow puncture in the front tyre and this was dealt with in addition to the MOT and brake disc & pad change that I had requested.
Collected the car and it had been valeted and washed - superb.
As I said 'Just the Job PLUS' which makes me put them at the top of the list for future jobs that may come along. Being VW though not too often."
12/14/16,5,"From initial contact, through the test drive in October to collecting the vehicle some 2-3 weeks earlier than forecast, my wife and I enjoyed an outstanding level of service from Hunters and Stuart Mason in particular. Attention to detail was excellent, even going so far as to make our Golden Retriever Monty welcome when we took him to the dealership to try the Discovery Sport on for boot size! Dog bowl, biscuits and doggy welcome mat we're waiting when we arrived - impressed! Stuart spent hours with my wife and I during the test drive day and also in scoping the vehicle spec and during our collection just the other day. Stuart pulled out the stops to get the vehicle to us before Xmas and even exceeded our delivery expectation by pulling forward from estimated 30 Dec to actual 12 Dec - great job. We are all, Monty included, now enjoying our new vehicle thanks to Hunters and to Stuart - well done indeed. It will now take the next 6 months to get to know all the features of the vehicle - we are looking forward to that. Excellent service - outstanding performance."
12/14/16,5,"Really genuine, helpful staff. They were really knowledgable and upfront, never felt under pressure to buy. I was looked after by Isaac Howes, he kept me updated throughout, he was very thorough, and called the day after I'd picked my car up to make sure I was happy. All the staff I spoke to were just down to earth and friendly, no patronising or overbearing sales tactics as I've experienced elsewhere in the past. Great experience, and so pleased with my car! Thank you."
12/14/16,5,"Great Service from John McGiffin at Audi Bolton

Helpful and not a puhsy sales man!! Would 10% recommend"
12/14/16,5,"I arrived for my express service the receptionists were very friendly and helpful booked me in and immediately guided me to the free tea coffee and biscuits. The car was serviced and they even vacuumed the boot which they don't normally do after it was in a bit of a mess after moving house. The car was washed I didn't recognise it from the road salt muck and grime covered car that I left with them.
This is the third time I have been to Warrington with a car to be serviced and the service is excellent"
12/14/16,5,Stuart was very helpful throughout the sale ensuring a very pleasant and professional experience. I will be back and recommending him to family and friends.
12/13/16,3,"Excellent patient service from my customer account manager ,after being able to show flexibility on price ( not found with other Audi dealerships)
After agreement they were able to prepare the paperwork and the vehicle to my timescales and to deal politely with outstanding questions arising
Would recommend this dealership"
12/13/16,5,Douglas and his team made our experience buying a new car effortless and enjoyable!
12/13/16,5,"My gift to myself when I retired was my Mini Countryman. It is an All 4 automatic model, black with sunroof and black wheels - and I LOVE it. I recently had it serviced at Coopers in Reading where I can tell you reliably that the experience was friendly, slick and speedy and comes highly recommended. A must visit for any Mini driver. Thank you guys"
12/12/16,5,Another new mini from Mini Reading sixth one.Regular updates on cars progress from Ian. Handover couln`t wish for a better service.Would recomend to anyone.Ask for Ian when you get there
12/12/16,5,"I went to Audi Maidstone because my previous experience with Audi Bexleyheath had been extremely poor.
I couldn't have been more satisfied with the service. Ricky was excellent at helping me choose the perfect car. He kept in regular contact while the car was being built and was always on hand if I had any questions. If you live in the DA7 area, head to Maidstone, the service is much better than Bexleyheath!"
12/12/16,5,"I am very impressed by the whole experience of MOT eg
booking in over phone - efficient
on arrival being greeted on car park - friendly and informative
met by David who oversaw booking - efficient, professional and friendly
informed car was ready by David
Met again on arrival
David informed me of report
Very good procedure and will be telling friends and family Thank you"
12/12/16,5,My car was booked in for a service and i required it back before 15.00 that day. The service and check was carried out thoroughly and the car washed and valeted and i was called at 14.00 to say it was ready. Excellent customer service and complete satisfaction.
12/12/16,5,Nice easy purchase with regular updates. brill
12/12/16,5,"Was my 1st service of new golf, what I thought was a nice touch was when my car was ready to pick up they sent me a video of my car up on the ramp proving they had changed my oil and filters, also with a tyre gauge in each tyre showing the depth, then they washed my car before handing it back."
12/12/16,3,"I recently had my car serviced and MoT'd. They needed the car for longer than I was informed when booking the car in which meant, although I had a loan car, I had to change my day around. The car came back even later than they said. I also didn't realise, because I wasn't told, that the MOT is done first then the service. I dropped the car at 9.30am and was told at 2.30pm it had passed its test, they then had to do the service! I then found out that the service was only really an oil change and an end of warranty check. My real gripe with this is that I purchased a 3 year service pack and because I have only done 8,000 miles each year the bigger, obviously more expensive service, falls outside of the service package I seem to have wasted my money on! When I purchase my next new car, BMW or probably other, I will check what I am told more thoroughly! Not happy."
12/12/16,5,"Paul Simpson was fantastic in assisting me with purchasing my new car. He explained everything including finance in clear detail and made the whole experience enjoyable rather than stressful.
thank you and would strongly recommend
Mrs Y Freeth"
12/12/16,5,"I have recently bought a VW Golf GTD at Stockport Volkswagen and can truly say it was a great experience. The staff were very friendly and helpful and when I had booked appointments I wasn't waiting too long to be seen to. I want to especially thank Adam Treadgold one of the sales representatives. From requesting a personal video to collecting my car the process couldn't have been better. His attention to detail and organisational skills are remarkable, plus he can have a laugh too. All in all I would recommmend anyone if your looking for a new or used car to include Stockport VW in your search, you certainly won't be let down."
12/12/16,5,I am very happy with the result Sheeraz was very helpful he called me and let me know how everything is going from beginning to end so I could give them a five star for that I have not got no problem so far
12/12/16,4,"Booked the car in for an annual service and confirmed there were two other items not working, parking sensors and the roof blind. Both warranty items. So the service was done in a day but the parts for the other items were not available and , with Christmas in the way, they won't be done til January now. The staff at Tunbridge Wells have always been excellent and, had the parts been available for a one-visit service, I would have been much happier and awarded 5 stars."
12/12/16,5,"The Audi experience makes you feel appreciated and important to them. Courtesy, hospitality and knowledge of your requirements are first class."
12/12/16,1,"I put my Audi 55 plate A6 S line tdi in for a simple oil change. I didn't check the cost beforehand, as how much should an oil change cost. To my shock and horror, I was presented with a bill for £211.62. With the oil costing about £30. When I complained, I was told this was a discounted price and that it was Audi UK who set the price for the oil change. Total control!"
12/11/16,5,"I had my vehicle serviced in different Mercedes garage last year which was an altogether very dissatisfying experience. This year, at Inchcape, my experience was very positive. From the moment I entered the reception area, I was treated as a valued customer. The receptionist took my driving licence to minimise delay and then, after a short wait in comfortable chairs with a cup of coffee, Sophy organised my service. She kept me informed throughout the service process and explained what had been done and took me to my car."
12/11/16,5,We have just bought a lovely second hand Mini One from Cooper Thames Ditton. The service was excellent from start to finish and we have to say a big thank you to Diana who explained everything very clearly to us and whose patience was endless!
12/11/16,5,Rachel was very helpful throughout the best review I can give is I will be back and recommending her to any friend or family.
12/10/16,5,"As always my service takes place in Reading organised by Mark Williams.
Actually I always buy my cars from Coopers because Mark has over many years about 15 years, provided top class service regardless of the issue even when they are very busy.. Great place to visit."
12/10/16,5,"The staff at Cooper Mini, York were very helpfull and courteous. Supplied with good coffee (in real cups!) whilst I waited for completion of the service. Cannot rate them highly enough. The car is brilliant as well."
12/9/16,5,"My mini has just had its winter health check and I can't fault the team at Cooper Teesside, 1st class service"
12/9/16,5,"Dave Clarke... great guy 100% service from arriving to handing over the keys,. Nothing to much trouble
Mike Atherton"
12/9/16,5,"My mini has just had her end of warranty check at mini Norwich. My first mini and am always happy with the friendly service and helpfulness of the team here.
And if I go in person my greyhound gets a biscuit. What's not to like?😀🐾😀🐾"
12/9/16,5,"The staff and especially Stuart Ruddock were efficient, courteous and extremely knowledgeable. I would have no hesitation in recommending the dealership to any family and friends."
12/8/16,5,"I was dealt with by Serkan Ulgen who was excellent and took me through the part ex of my old Golf and the purchase of another Golf Diesel.
He was excellent and kept me informed at every stage of the purchase.
At the handover he gave a comprehensive run through of the vehicle set the radio and set up my mobile phone on the hands free.
I would not hesitate to recommend Inchcape VW Wirral and Serkan Ulgen"
12/8/16,5,"I couldn't fault the service I received, from the time I arrived to picking up my mini a few hours later.
I would definitely recommend to my friends and family if they owned or were thinking of owning a mini."
12/8/16,5,"Why would I buy a BMW from CooperBMW Teeside when I live in Leeds and have a local BMW dealer?

Well the answer is simply down to customer service, when after having a short test drive, the salesman says goodbye without offering his business card I take it as the earilest indication that they dont need my business, so sorry Leeds you were pants!

Cooper BMW Teeside however presented a much friendlier atmosphere and experience and Stephen Crossman the sales exec I dealt with needs mentioning in despatches for his keen determination to find me a car deal that fit my requirements and budget. Origionally looking at second owner vehicle I actually purchased a new X3.

For the experience I have had with CooperBMW Teeside I can recommend them for their customer service and hospitality, at the end of the day the car is the car, its the buying exprience that that for me makes it a good or bad experience."
12/8/16,5,Thomas Turner assisted me with finding the right vehicle for me worked around my working day so i didnt have to loose a days work. He also kept in contact with me through every step. I am very satisfied with the vehicle and would return to Mercedes Benz Coventry for my next vehicle and I would recommend anyone that is looking for great service and excellent vehicles to do the same.
12/8/16,5,Jake was fantastic and couldn't have been more helpful.
12/8/16,5,Just had an MOT done which was competitively priced. Very courteous and friendly staff and even got the car washed and vacuumed. Excellent!
12/8/16,5,Totally reliable. Kept informed about all issues and particularly good at arranging collection and return of car. I like the little touch of a link to a video showing parts that need replacing. Can't think why I would go to any other dealer.
12/7/16,5,Graham at VW Wirral was fantastic and provided me with great customer service when I bought my new Tiguan. The whole process was seamless and hassle free.
12/6/16,5,Purchase went very smoothly
12/6/16,5,"From initial conversations about spec and options, through quotes and order placement, the effort, enthusiasm and level of communication from Kieren at Tetbury Audi has been exceptional."
12/6/16,5,"Steven Barden, Oli and all the team at Mini Thames Ditton really were amazing! From the welcome my little son and I received to the understanding of my situation with a special needs child was just amazing. The information, help and guidance they have given me made the whole process painless which is amazing as I am rubbish with cars. They made me feel like I knew what I was doing, gave me a great deal and made it easy for me to make the decision to buy. I am so glad to be back with Mini."
12/6/16,5,"I would happily recommend this branch to family and friends, especially Iain who really took the time to explain everything and all my options before i purchased my car. Really easy experience, within 2 weeks of ordering my car, i was p/x'ing my old car & driving away happy as larry! Thank you very much guys xx"
12/6/16,5,Very pleased with my experience of buying an A3 from Mike. Great service & very happy with my new car. Thank you !
12/5/16,5,From the moment I walked into Mini Norwich with my husband we were well looked after. Very happy with my beautiful mini cooper convertible that is very smart and fun to drive. Max and the team were helpful and knowledgeable and did not pressure to buy.Making sure that they found the right mini that matched all my needs. This is my first ever Mini and will be recommending Mini Norwich to family and friends.
12/5/16,5,I recently got a new car from Toyota Inchcape Burton. The customer service was fantastic they were very attentive and answered all my questions and queries.
12/5/16,5,"I booked my car in to leave for the day for the work. The representative offered to do the work immediately while I waited and within a hour it was done and the car vacuumed and washed. Great service, thank you."
12/5/16,2,The cost of service through Mercedes is nothing short of extortionate. The service was good and yes I was kept informed but at that price I would want more for my money. The service clean was average at best ... not impressed
12/4/16,5,"Amanda at VW Inchcape was very helpful and understanding of my particular needs in purchasing a VW Polo, in fact all the staff I encountered were very polite and customer focused. The test drive was thorough and really gave me a feel for the car and whether I would be comfortable driving. I didn't feel pressured at any time and was give time to make my decision. At collection, Amanda was again very thorough with the hand over and called me the following day to see if everything was ok. I would highly recommend this dealership."
12/4/16,5,Just bought my second BMW from Coopers and the service provided by their salesman Jodi was excellent and very professional. I would have no hesitation recommending Coppers for future purchases and / or servicing.
12/4/16,5,"Carl Fraser was my personal sales rep;
His attentive and genuine interest in my personal needs for a new car purchase were outstanding, I would have no hesitation in recommending him, the dealership or the car, all of which were and are fantastic!
Carl not only listened, he also 'heard' what i wanted out of this purchase, the experience was first class, I cannot thank him and the Team enough!"
12/4/16,4,"When I initially contacted service help line we got in to a row about whether VW were going to honour the service plan that was agreed when I purchased car, which apparently did not exist. Once local branch rang me to confirm date and details they miraculously found service plan straight away and from then on service was excellent and proceeded without a hitch"
12/4/16,5,Many thanks to Alan for looking after my vehicle. Problem solved quickly and efficiently.
12/3/16,5,I was served by Catherine who was superb!! She is an asset to Audi! Always pleased when I take my pride and joy to East Kent Audi!
12/3/16,5,"Extremely satisfied with the professional enthusiastic service received from VW Chelmsford, level of customer service received from Brian Cookson was excellent. He kept us informed through the whole process in buying out new car. Great attention to detail and his knowledge of the brand and product was clearly demonstrated,he is a great asset to the company and clearly proud of representing VW.
Will definitely recommend him to other friends and family of mine!"
12/2/16,5,"Excellent service from Gavin & Tash. No pressure selling,nothing was too much trouble and everything explained in detail. The reception staff very welcoming and professional. First experience on buying a brand new car,
Would recommend Inchcape VW Exeter."

12/2/16,5,"This is the first time I have ever dealt with Land Rover and I have to say I have been extremely impressed. Jon Hussey at Southampton has been superb throughout the experience, first by listening to what we were looking for and then finding us an excellent deal. The whole experience has been a joy and I never thought I would EVER say that about buying a car! Let's hope the car lives up to the standards set by Hunters - so far so good but we are only on day 2! Thank you Jon."
12/2/16,5,"I purchased my Land Rover from another dealer in Hertfordshire, but felt badly let down by their after sales service.
I went to Hunters and was pleasantly surprised how good their service was. I would recommend them to anyone needing a Land Rover dealer."
12/2/16,5,"Really great buying experience at Inchcape. From the first visit, we were dealt with by Danny Cooper. Really relaxed, not at all pushy. Our requirements were listened to and we were able to negotiate a deal that was right for us. Great test drive, not just up and down the road outside the dealership as I have had on numerous occasions elsewhere. We were able to take the car on different types of road and really get a feel for the performance. Beautiful car, delivered on time and the handover was excellent. Throughout the experience I can honestly say that we felt that our custom was valued. Thanks Danny and all at Inchcape."
12/2/16,5,"Easy to deal with, booking and service. They arrange transport to Guildford and a pick up."
12/1/16,5,I have just purchased my 5th bmw all from cooper Chelmsford and our sales person Adrian was first class very helpful to our needs and I've just had my over bmw serviced at the same branch as usual carried out while I waited on a Saturday morning as someone from the trade previously the service from cooper Chelmsford is nothing short of first class thank you
12/1/16,5,Brilliant service from start to finish. Second car I have bought from here and have never had any problems. Well looked after by Ed. Would definitely recommend
12/1/16,5,"We found the buying , and hand over experience very pleasant and hassle free. We didn't even see a picture of the car on the website, I spoke to Mark Rushen who described the car to me as being a very good example, he wasn't wrong.
Mark handled the transaction from start to finish in a friendly professional manner. Nothing was too much trouble, at any stage of the process.
We were extremely satisfied with the overall experience. and drove away happy , with such personable service .
We would be happy to recommend Inchcape in the future and will return for the next car."
12/1/16,5,"We found the buying , and hand over experience very pleasant and hassle free.
Rachael handled the transaction from start to finish in a professional business like way. Nothing was too much trouble, at any stage of the process.
She kept us up to date with the delivery schedule, and picked us up from the station on collection day.
We were extremely satisfied with the overall experience. and drove away happy , with such personable service .
We would be happy to recommend Inchcape in the future."
12/1/16,5,"Very helpful staff, very knowledgable, listen to customer needs, work out best option for customer!"
12/1/16,5,I was nervous about making the commitment of buying a new car. I was made to feel welcome as soon as I stepped through the door. All my questions doubts and queries were answered or resolved with no fuss. I was made to feel valued by Shiraz and the rest of the team and the definitely went the extra mile. They were honest and conscientious of my needs and worked with me to create a deal I couldn't refuse. The aftercare is very important to me as I don't like to feel disregarded after the sale. I can honestly say that I feel supported and valued now that the sale is completed. One very satisfied customer here that will be returning and spreading the word regarding my positive experience. Thank you.
12/1/16,5,Thank you all for a great car and a super experience
12/1/16,5,"After experiencing problems with my current car the staff at BMW Cooper's Durham were understanding, never used the 'hard sell' and were genuinely interested in providing world class service. Daniel and Mike guided me through the options for car and protection policies.
A great experience for somebody who lectures in business and managing stakeholder expectations. Other car dealership should pay attention so they do not remain consciously incompetent."
12/1/16,5,"I initially contacted Cooper BMW by telephone having seen a vehicle advertised on their website. Considering I live at the other end of the country I did have some reservations about even considering buying a car over the telephone. The salesman, Terry Parker, was immediately very reassuring and in no time at all I felt much more at ease. In no time at all I had a personalised video emailed to me and with further assurances from Terry I went ahead with the purchase which incorporated delivery to my home. Everything went exactly to plan and even the delivery driver, who was acting for an independent logistics company was every bit as excellent as all the Coope BMW staff I encountered during my purchase. Buying a car at distance wouldn't perhaps be the first choice for anyone but I needn't have worried at all. CooperBMW were a pleasure to deal with throughout and the car was every bit as good as expected."
12/1/16,5,Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. The service was excellent and they went beyond themselves to achieve what was requested in terms of the order date and delivery of what is one of the best cars I have had from this company. I would always go to this company for the best service and best available deal and would highly recommend them to anyone else who is considering purchasing a car.
12/1/16,5,I have just bought my 3rd mini from Malton.. Jack and Chris were brilliant - thanks !
12/1/16,5,"Excellent service. Good idea to provide a video of the underside of the car, so you can see the state of the exhaust and suspension for yourself. Excellent service from the staff (especially Kerry)"
12/1/16,5,Staff are friendly helpful and knowledgeable. In particular Amanda who dealt with me. I could not fault the attention to detail of this company. The car was presented to me covered up so that I could unwrap it and I was sent a picture of it with a big red bow. The gift of a bottle of champagne was an additional surprise.
12/1/16,5,"The staff at InchcapeToyota, Nottingham, made purchasing a car so simple and stress free! As I don't live locally, they sent me a personal video of the car I hoped to purchase to save me wasting a long journey. They reserved the car for me until I could visit the garage and I drove away the same day with a great value and quality car!"
11/30/16,5,"We travelled 200 miles to purchase our A class 180 sport which was as described over the phone in superb condition and Warren in sales was professional, friendly and exceptionally helpfull from the first contact to the final purchase. Exceptional Mercedes dealership."
11/30/16,5,Excellent service. Attentive and highly professional throughout.
11/30/16,5,"Wonderful experience! Amanda made purchasing my first car a pleasure. Excellent support and advice, the car was even wrapped in a bow when I picked it up."

11/30/16,5,Five star - outstanding service and advice! Would highly recommend.
11/30/16,5,"Great experience at Inchcape Bolton when buying my new car. Dealt with Stuart Wolfendale. Honest, professional and kept informed the entire process. Also sorted me out when I had a slight problem on the day I collected my car.
Full marks, cheers!"
11/30/16,5,Inchcape Chester. Great service as always. Highly recommended
11/30/16,5,"I cannot stress enough at how good the service is from Lexus Derby. Always a friendly face to greet you, always being offered a drink too, just an overall nice place to be. Staff are great and dealt with the car with care and efficiency. Even washed it for me.

Highly recommended."
11/30/16,5,"I visited the team here after a very disappointing experience at Range Rover Thames Ditton. The experience here couldn't have been more different. Tom and Adam have been great throughout as was their BMW Genius who was awesome! We had an issue, not of their making, at the last minute. It's times like that you really see how a team performs, and the guys were amazing in terms of ensuring it didn't impact us. A definite recommendation. Oh, and the car is amazing too! Thank you all."
11/29/16,4,"I purchased one of the Last defenders a few weeks ago, I was pleased to find that both the vehicle and the service met with my expectations. Particular thanks to Phillip in the used car department for his advice and attention to detail. Hopefully I can award that final 5th star as and when an unforeseen issue with the vehicles roof is successfully resolved."
11/29/16,5,"Excellent friendly service from start to finish,would happily recommend them to anyone who is interested in buying a mini new or used!.."
11/29/16,5,"Excellent customer service, went above and beyond to find me a car once the model I had wanted was sold and very personable and charming on the day."
11/29/16,5,We have bought many cars over the years from numerous garages but this was our best experience yet. Excellent sales and service from Mo from start to finish and he made the collection/handover of the car really special and memorable. Would certainly buy again from this garage.
11/29/16,5,"Picked up a beautiful new car this week. All was exactly as BMW promised, a smooth transition in handing over my first BMW and collecting my second. Lots of friendly and helpful staff. Thank you Ant and Will"
11/29/16,5,Cannot fault anything about the whole process from original reception in the showroom to final handover day. Thank you.
11/28/16,5,My Passat was collected promptly for its service and returned by mid afternoon. The service video was useful too and thorough. A great service altogether.
11/28/16,5,"Excellent vehicle dealer, with a great range of Audi's. Large open building with plenty of desks to sit and discuss vehicles, great back room where you can collect new vehicles.

My experience was excellent, I knew very little about the A4 or A6 and required a fair bit of briefing about them, as I like detail. The sales person was patient with me, explained the differences and was happy to take me out on a test drive. I spent a fair while going through the purchasing process, financing options and all the various options. I was fully supported (and with plenty of coffee!) throughout.

Parking can be tricky as there are a lot of vehicles in the park. If you're looking for a new or used car I'd highly recommend a visit."
11/28/16,5,"My Tiguan needed a Air Con service and emission software update. Very clear and helpful telephone communications regarding collection and return of car, and making arrangements for payment. A video of the service process was sent via email attachment, and all documentation associated with work undertaken. The level of customer support that I have received has been outstanding and I am absolutely delighted that I went to Inchcape VW at Swindon to get my latest car"
11/28/16,5,"Fantastic service from start to finish from Inchcape Leicester, especially sales exec Alvin who was with me all the way. Would not hesitate to recommend Mercedes - the E Class Coupe is superb!!"
11/28/16,5,"My visit to Volkswagen Twickenham for the first Annual Service of VW Tiguan was a very pleasant experience. Dee Barr looked after me very well and kept me fully updated during the day. I received a video report from the service engineer detailing the service and the condition of my vehicle. Finally at collection, Dee Barr went through the service paperwork and explained all the relevant invoice information."
11/28/16,5,"After driving BMW's for 20 years I was a little sceptical to test drive an Audi but when I got behind the wheel of my chosen comparison to the 3 series, well it was fantastic, I chose the A4 3.0 TDI Quattro what a car, drives superbly handles superbly looks fantastic and 47MPG cruising up the M4 at 74MPH I am delighted I love it, The sales experience with Anthony was really good, nothing was too much trouble and the service support from Kelly was fantastic as I bought a second hand car there were a couple of things missing, the audio lead from car to phone and the MMI system needed a software upgrade all booked in no trouble and no charge definitely an Audi man now BMW would have to do well to beat this car."

11/25/16,4,"Wanted to test drive a 218 or 220i automatic Active Tourer. Coopers could source a Grand Tourer, Manuals, Diesels, but it took a long time to find a 218 or 220 petrol auto.

Once that problem had been solved, the Service was excellent, keeping me in touch with the progress of my order, etc, and explaining the way the car worked at handover - my previous car being 15 years old was of a different technology

System has just asked me to do a review =- having done one a couple of days ago - so thought I would try Google this time it asked me to put my name in, but did not provide anywhere to put my name in. So although I had done a trustpilot one already, assumed it had got lost in the system so went on to trustpoilot again and what do I find there - MY REVIEW - so the review system is somewhat screwed up!!!!!!!"

I would recommend this dealership"
11/21/16,5,"Recently bought a new A3 from Cheshire Oaks Audi which has been my first new car purchase. Dealt with Leon through every stage of purchase from initial enquiry through to purchase. Leon was very attentive and answered all my questions in detail, he also picked a fantastic test drive route that incorporated a number of different roads allowing me to get a proper feel for the car. Leon picked out a brilliantly specced A3 that was in stock and put together a great deal which included a good price for my part ex and easy managable monthly payments on PCP.

As the car was in stock I picked it up the following week, Leon talked me through the features on my car and discussed all the finincial details in depth. Car was presented nicely at the front of the dealership and with a bit of luck with the weather! I have since had follow up calls to ensure I am happy with my new car which I think was a nice touch and have been invited to pop down for a cuppa to have a look around the dealership and to sort any future details with my car such as getting private registration.

Overall my buying experience with Cheshire Oaks Audi has been superb, I had heard horror stories from friends who had looked to purchase but find these hard to believe given my personal experience. I will definitely look to purchase from this dealership again."

11/21/16,5,"Audi Bolton have a fantastic selection of new and approved cars and are able to source cars from across their network of dealerships.

Gareth was especially helpful. Listened to our exact (and demanding) criteria and found us the perfect car. Communication was fantastic as was the after sales. Audi can't do enough to help and where always there if we had any questions.


Can't recommend highly enough, fantastic!"
11/21/16,5,"Good, efficient service by BMW Croydon. Car collected early in the morning and delivered back early afternoon clean and with paperwork completed."
11/21/16,5,"We have just bought a new vehicle from VW Chester. The experience was enjoyable & informative.

However he was not 'pushy' in any way and all the other staff members were also friendly and approachable.
I would recommend this dealership."
11/20/16,4,"The car was easy to book in for appointment & lift provided promptly to & from work. Car was clean & clear details provided on service report. I was given keys but could not find car, had to go back & ask staff who found car was round the back out of sight."
11/20/16,1,"I have left the car for service on Monday was given a lift home with my car by member of staff from Volkswagen Romford and the person drove back for service, I picked the car on Tuesday evening after all was done.
The next morning on the way to work I heard a noise underneath the car, when arrived I checked and found underneath a plastic lining broken ,I was thinking it happened during DSG gearbox oil change, I went back to Volkswagen and complained, their line of story was that ""it is old damage""
then I asked why it was not pointed out to me before they gave me the car with all clear? and then volkswagen said it was not there at the time of service as They would have seen it. funny how story changed? The way I sea this Is : 1.It happened whilst in Volkswagen care or 2.It happened long time ago . The only problem Why they did not see this while doing my car?
I blame Volkswagen for this incident who refuse to take any blame. I will never use again this Inchape Volkswagen Romford as this was a Third incident with them.Never Again"

11/17/16,5,"Received excellent service from David Willis at Audi Stockport, from the first day I visited the showroom looking at the range right through to picking up my new A3.

David was very thorough, friendly and very approachable. David kept me informed of the progress of the build of my new car and always contacted me on the days he said he would. Never once did I have to chase anything up.

Upon picking my car up, David took plenty of time talking me through all of functions, ensuring I was happy with everything before driving away.

After sales has also been good, again with David contacting me as agreed to see if everything was going fine

The reception staff are also very welcoming and friendly

We arranged a part exchange deal and drove off in our new car 2 days later."
11/16/16,5,"The service department excelled by resolving the problem that I had on my new car, swiftly and without charge. They could so easily have gone ahead with an agreed £500 resolution to my problem. Having investigated the issues and even though they had ordered spare parts, they believed that the situation could be rectified without replacement parts. This they did, exceeding my expectations and didn't even charge me for the labour.
Oxford Mercedes is a company I trust totally and they will continue to have my support and business going forwards."

11/15/16,5,"Reason: I took my car in for an annual service and factory recall for the emissions update.
I was utterly impressed with the customer service I received. The staff were very courteous and professional.
The handover of my vehicle and the receipt of a hire car was smooth and quick. The hire was free and I was offered a collision waiver for £15 well worth it.
I was send a video of the car inspection performed by their technician and this was followed up by a phone call.
Furthermore, when I returned for my vehicle, I was also given a boxed gift as an apology on behalf of VW for the emissions recall.

I found their prices steep but I also found them to be trustworthy and friendly. Top marks!

Thanks again Inchcape Bolton"
11/15/16,5,"My wife and I went to review a Series 1, we had such good service and information from all the people we met. We had test drives in two vehicles allowed to borrow them for the day if we wished.
We pestered them with questions and emails and we took two weeks to make up our minds. Not a problem they were very attentive throughout the whole process. I went back with a few questions 3 days after buying
a Series 1 Xdrive, they were just as good if not better.

Barrie and Marjorie Lister"

11/11/16,5,"We were well looked after from start to finish - friendly, knowledgeable, efficient service, and honest advice about what would work best for us (i.e. not just trying to get us to go for all the options). Nothing was too much trouble, both in service re our old car and in sales re our new one - can't recommend them highly enough."
11/11/16,5,I bought my last TT from Cheshire Oaks Audi a few years ago from Richard Stockton and when I decided to change my car I asked for him and it was a pleasure to deal with him again.

11/11/16,5,"Took my M3 in for the complimentary winter check and whilst there I was told a new recall had just been notified for the drivers airbag. This was done at the same time completely hassle free whilst I was enjoying coffee and biscuits!
First rate service, Thank you."
11/11/16,4,"While I appreciate the great customer service ethic, the helpful staff, great communications etc., I find VW very expensive to deal with.
While I also appreciate the gift I was given and the efforts to sort out the emissions problem with my car, there's a sour taste in my mouth over the fact that people in other countries got financial compensation for the deceit. The value of my car is probably lower, and my insurance went up (the company claims it's not because of the emissions problem, but I don't believe them) Not a happy customer at all, overall. I don't hold VW with the same high regard and prestige as before all of this happened and will seek my servicing elsewhere more reasonably priced."
11/11/16,5,Great service at very reasonable money but most importantly excellent communications throughout the service process.
11/11/16,5,"That visit to HA Fox, York was my first experience of a Jaguar dealership and I can only say that I was extremely impressed with the service that I received. I would not hesitate to recommend them to other prospective buyers."

11/10/16,5,"I have been going to Inchcape Telford for a number of years for new cars and servicing and have always had excellent service at a reasonable price. My most recent visit was to buy a new car and with the help of a 'carwow' quote I quickly agreed what I considered to be a good deal. I dealt with Hayley who was very helpful, friendly and efficient and made the whole process a very enjoyable experience. She kept me up to date with progress at all stages by phone, email and video and spent time showing me the new features I wanted to know about before I drove it away. The car was perfectly prepared, spotless and faultless and is a pleasure to drive. I would recommend Inchcape Telford to anyone wanting great service."
11/10/16,5,"Good service! All done on time , fair pricing and all done while i waited."
11/10/16,5,"Needed to have cruise control retro fitted to my Scirocco, searched around on line for the best deal and surprised to find I couldn't better the price offered by Inchcape Volkswagen Chelmsford. Part ordered and car booked in over the phone, text and phone confirmations received to keep me informed of progress. Greeted warmly on arrival in very pleasant surroundings. Work was carried out while I waited and ahead of promised time scale even with a courtesy car wash thrown in. Received a follow up phone call the following day to ensure I was completely happy. Cannot rate the experience highly enough and would recommend them to all Volkswagen owners in need of efficient and courteous work, a real high in the world of Main dealerships."

They sorted the whole deal out and gave me a full 'lesson' on how to use my new car. I highly recommend these guys, approachable, professionals with a passion for the cars they sell. Simply fantastic"
11/9/16,4,Very polite and professional
11/8/16,5,Job on car was finished well within agreed time and I was given a lift into the dealer to collect the car.

Cary on the good work.

11/7/16,5,"I live in Kent and have owned a Discovery 4 for a while. I wanted to part exchange it for a newer model and called Hunters Derby to see what was available and get a price for my car. Geoff Handley took on my cause. On our first call, he came back to me with a part-exchange price very quickly, then using Facetime, he walked me round the dealership car park, stopping at various models to demonstrate colours, interiors and extras. Having expressed an interest in a particular vehicle which was just available, Geoff told me that there was other interest in it, but he left me to think it over without hassling me at all and we agreed a deal in principle the next day. I never looked at any other vehicles although I contacted 3 other dealerships. I didn’t have the need to as he had given me a good deal.
I arranged to come to Derby to swap the cars and Geoff was very clear regarding how the process would work for both vehicles. He answered my many queries and questions calmly and courteously at all times and his email and phone response when unavailable were always in a good timeframe.
On the day of collection, I was earlier than expected and was welcomed by the Receptionist, who dispensed coffee whilst I waited. I was warmly greeted by other members of staff.
The time and effort taking by Geoff on that day, to ensure that I was completely satisfied and that nothing was left to chance in the paperwork was brilliant and I drove away with my new car having had an excellent experience.
Since then, Geoff has fulfilled his commitment to get me the additional items that I requested, and send them to me very quickly. He has continued to be of assistance by email and I know that I can contact him anytime I need to. He has a great manner and actually makes you feel that
From my first phone call, to my completing the purchase in Derby was 5 days. A record for me! So smooth, simple and quick by comparison to other cars that I have bought and therefore a thoroughly good transaction. I would recommend Hunters Derby and specifically Geoff Handley anytime."
11/7/16,5,"Honest reliable advise. Norwich has got better over the years. I will be returning to buy my next car from you.
Thanks you."
11/7/16,5,"I used the pick up and drop off the car service, the call handler was efficient from initial booking. Driver was smart, polite and helpful. Service advisor, was informative-kept me up to date with the progress of the work being carried out. Service advisor didn't make me feel pressured to have work carried out. My car came back clean :). Only negative feedback- there's a long waiting list to have the pick up and drop off your car service. However, the service overall is fantastic from BMW Cooper Banstead. Would definately recommend."
11/7/16,5,Recently needed some work done and the service was excellent. I was kept informed start to finish and they managed to complete the work before the scheduled date. Special mention to Shaun who managed it throughout.
11/7/16,5,"Friendly and courtious greeting, simple booking in and confirmation of details. Checked car before service for everyones piece of mind (really happy with that as my car is completely unmarked). Updated on service progress and estimated time of completion. Good quality complimentary coffee and TV.
Even walked me back to my car; better than wandering around looking for it.
Pricing was reasonable for main dealer. All in, a very good experience and acceptable charges."
11/7/16,5,Great service pleasure to deal with
11/7/16,5,As always the staff we incredibly helpful and genuinely wanted to help. I highly recommend them
11/7/16,5,Everything was done well and as promised.
11/7/16,5,"Recently bought a new Mini Countryman Cooper D for my work, the Sales guy, Adam Rednall was excellent from the start to the day I drove out and actually still gets in touch, aftercare, his knowledge of the product, his listening ear and support in finding the right vehicle for me has been OUTSTANDING, i cannot praise him enough.
Attention to detail was excellent too.
RECOMMEND Adam to all potential mini buyers or like me just upgrading.
Thank you"
11/7/16,5,Excellent customer service.
11/7/16,5,"Adnan was very knowledgable and passionate about helping me through what is a new experience for me, getting a 4 series on a personal contract. I'm still in contact with him and would throughly recommend using him."
11/7/16,5,"This was my first experience as a buyer from Inschape Toyota in Nottingham, although my wife has bought several Yaris' from them over the years.

I could not fault any part of the customer service, from booking my test drive through to picking up the car and the courtesy call a week later.

Would highly recommend to anyone."
11/7/16,5,"I was very happy with the customer service. I was met promptly at 8am as agreed and given a briefing of the works they would be carrying out.
I was contacted later in the day with an update and was able to collect my car at the end of the day with all works completed together with an inside and outside cleaning of my car."
11/6/16,5,"Very happy with using Cooper BMW Norwich. Certainly glad we were looked after by Jake. He was very friendly, honest, & very professional with regular communication. Highly recommended."
11/6/16,5,"We recently purchased a new BMW 118i 5 door Sport from Cooper BMW Norwich. The staff, particularly Colin Chandler and Simon Parkinson, are very product knowledgeable and courteous do deal with. As a family we have owned BMW Cars since the 1970,s, this is our first dealings with this particular franchise as we only moved to East Anglia 18 months ago. I would compare Cooper Norwich very favourably with any of the previously used garages we have used in the North of England and would certainly recommend them to anyone wishing to buy into the BMW experience. Good Product, Great Service. 10/10 to Cooper BMW Norwich."
11/6/16,4,"As always I used Cooper Norwich and I am never disappointed.
On this occasion I needed a fuse replacing which I believe is accessed through my glovebox.
The problem now is it opens and closes with a clunk and not in its usual dampened manner."
11/6/16,5,I collected my new Audi S3 Sportback from Tetbury Audi on Saturday. The experience from initial contact to handover was excellent. Thanks to Stephen and Tetbury Audi for getting me into the car of my choice with the spec of my choice. A thoroughly pleasant experience.
11/6/16,3,"I bought my second hand E-Class estate from my local dealership. A couple of months later I took it in for a service and they told me it needed four new tyres and quoted £2k! The next service they told me that a ball joint was worn, needed replacing and I might as well have both sides done at the same time. I sought a second opinion that said there was minor wear on one side but the other was perfectly OK. That was about four years ago. I still have the car serviced to maintain a full MB service history but I don't trust them to do any work they say needs doing."
11/6/16,5,"I'd dithered for a while in response to the VW email about their Good as New Event, but after looking more closely at possible options for replacing my 58 reg. Tiguan, I realised that my local dealership in Swindon appeared to have the right car, at the right price - even in the right colour! So I arranged to meet a salesman early on Saturday morning (22 Oct.), and by the time I left had done a deal for a fair PX and finance for the balance. I could have made the swap sooner, but we already had a weekend away booked, so Halloween it was: treat, not trick!"
11/6/16,5,"From the moment I walked into the showroom I felt confident that I had arrived at a paramount Audi dealer

The sales executive Jeff was professional, knowledgeable and extremely helpful

I was having a test drive within 30 minutes - sale done !"
11/6/16,5,"Fantastic company, so friendly to deal with what a fantastic service I received from all the staff! 2nd car purchased now!"
11/6/16,5,I have been using Cooper Tunbridge Wells for years now (4 cars) and have always them to be efficient and not doing unnecessary work to my car. For a main dealer the prices are very fair and the car is always returned on time and clean both inside and out. Very much recommended
11/6/16,5,"Very quick service, saw my car on a Friday and collected it on the following Monday. Great customer service, everything explained well and would definitely recommend the Telford dealership."
11/6/16,5,"The whole process was quick, easy and smooth. Was kept informed throughout was washed and vacuumed"
11/5/16,3,"Excellent sales service. Great service when I had a small item that needed to be resolved. Then had an issue getting a 'loan' car for the next service. Especially rescheduled the service to when a car was available only to be told that one wasn't available when I arrived. Had I known this in advance (a call would have been nice) then I would have re-scheduled and not wasted half a day waiting for the service to be done. That said, we did get to sit in a nice lounge, drink complimentary coffee and read magazines...."
11/5/16,5,"Very inviting, no intimidation, very very friendly. The staff listen to your requirements and there are no pushy selling tactics! Second time I have purchased from H A Fox. Always a pleasure!"
11/5/16,5,I've had four Yaris from this company over the years and have experienced first class service every time. The staff are courteous and knowledgeable and my cars are always dealt with in a thoroughly professional manner.
11/4/16,5,"I recently bought my first ever Range Rover and I have to say that this experience is one i would like to repeat. From start to finish the sales rep, Mike, has been first class. Nothing was too much trouble. We looked at several vehicles and eventually we found the vehicle we were looking for. There was no hard sell, no pressure and we were actually allowed to enjoy the visits to the dealership. The ladies on reception are fantastic and make you feel welcome and the coffee is delicious...Our sales rep Mike was a real down to earth bloke and more importantly, he keeps his promises and if he says something will happen, it will - Such a refreshing change to previous car sales experiences. The vehicle was immaculate when we picked it up - gleaming...
If you are looking to buy a vehicle from this dealership then I would highly recommend them. Thanks again to Mike and all the team at Hunters, Chester - You will see us again."
11/4/16,5,"Best team and support
Very faster. Thank you very much. Stefan."
11/4/16,5,"Car service - competitive priced. Friendly welcome, excellent communication updating on progress."
11/4/16,5,Excellent service with car completed on time and a text message to confirm
11/4/16,5,"Totally professional service. Prompt, efficient, courteous and considerate at all times. Courtesy car supplied without at fuss. Very satisfied."
11/4/16,5,"Bought last two cars from Swindon Audi, tried other more local dealers but Swindon Audi always comes up trumps. They pulled out all the stops to get me a test car to drive and then were very helpful and easy to deal with when I came to actually purchase (Bath and Tetbury have a lot to learn) . Only downside is I won't be able to use for the servicing as it is a bit of a distance to travel."
11/4/16,4,"Ok, I searched the net without contemplating change of vehicle. I had an A1 1.4 TFSI. Excellent car which brought the fun back to driving. My eye was caught by a 65 plate A1 at Inchcapeaudi Hyde. An S-line model which looked rather good. I popped down and saw said car and chatted with a very pleasant salesman. I returned after the weekend and another friendly chat and test drive ensued,with a deal ending that night,I agreed to buy. I was happy to wait a few days for the car to be readied for sale. I was informed the audit was due the next day and asked if I'd assist by taking the car that night, which, while surprised, was happy to agree. On departing the garage I found a discrepancy with the mileage (advertised as 7500, odometer reading 10200!). We'd also agreed work to be booked in for the alloys which weren't looking too great. Again I agreed for the work to be carried out post purchase.
I've spoken to my salesman, who I can't stress enough was very pleasant and helpful. Received a courtesy call from Paul and we have resolved the mileage issue. Looking forward to the alloys being brought up to scratch(free) and once my valeter has sorted paint swirls I'll feel as though I've got an absolutely gorgeous motor car!!"
11/4/16,5,From start to finish the visit was managed by friendly staff that notified me timely when the work was complete.
11/4/16,5,"I recently purchased a BMW 2 series from cooper in Croydon, and initially dealt with Caroline. She was professional, true to her word and was very clear on pricing and specification. She was friendly and respected the fact I wanted the car sooner than later. Knowing she was going on leave, Caroline finalised all the documents and introduced me to Wasif who would be doing the car handover. Wasif was polite and courteous and kept me updated. He also adjusted his work shift to get in early for me the day I picked the car up as I had other commitments later that day and needed it first thing. He was not only professional but very genuine. I did have an issue with the sat nav code, no fault of Croydon BMW but this was dealt with quickly and efficiently and when also having an issue with the asset protection, Steve (Wasif and Caroline's manager) helped to deal with this and it was sorted within 24 hours. Thank you to all three of you for the advice, guidance and support, I am absolutely loving the new car!"
11/3/16,5,"Car collected, car returned, all on time and valeted to boot.
Kept informed throughout the process and provided with a video of the inspection. Well done."
11/3/16,5,Just a service at Cooper Teesside this time but as always the staff were helpful and attentive and the service was completed on time and the car was returned clean inside and out.
11/3/16,5,We had a really great experience at VW and are very happy with our new car! Gavin provided excellent customer service - couldn't have asked for more.
11/3/16,5,"Every time i have any work done on my car the service team are exceptional. This time i was looked after by Jessica Williams who was nothing short of outstanding. She was ready for me when i arrived, kept me up to date with the work required and made sure my car was ready and cleaned when i wanted to collect it. Great work Jess!!"
11/3/16,5,"After considering and reviewing Minis for around 12 months before finally purchasing a Mini JCW. I obviously visited around 6 different dealerships! Up to the point of placing the order.
All Mini sales consultants, at all dealerships have a very relaxed approach and never seem to put you under pressure. Quite a nice experience for car buying.
However Cooper Malton Mini seem to go one step further. My sales consultant Rachel Brockett was superb, nothing was to much trouble. The welcoming and friendly atmosphere from everyone was spot on. Plus they put together a great deal.
I traveled 65 miles to use this dealership. (Worth every mile) It's 10 out of 10 from me.
By the way. The car's fantastic as well. Thanks Cooper Malton.

Rob Porter."
11/3/16,5,"Took my car in for a service, greeted warmly even though I hadn't purchased the car through them. Everything explained clearly also the cost . Kept informed throughout the service. On my way home 2 hours later. Excellent service ."
11/3/16,5,Brilliant customer service
11/2/16,5,"Always a first class service from the moment when you walk in the showroom. The ladies on the reception desk are friendly and pleasant and do everything they can to ensure you are seen to as quickly as possible. A coffee always on offer.

Service Desk staff are experienced and able to appreciate you want to be sorted as quickly as possible, even though as in my case its a repeating issue on the onboard computer."
11/2/16,5,"Excellent service from start to finish, very nice people, I have perchased a few cars over the years and nother compared to the excellent service I received, kind regards
Ceri"
11/2/16,5,"made very welcome kyle took us through all the procedures of purchasing our new car, every thing went through smoothly. Thanks very much to kyle and all the staff in Manchester for all there help."
11/2/16,5,"My wife and I went to Inchcape Mercedes in Chester yesterday to buy 2 new cars. We were warmly greeted and the whole process was dealt with in a vey friendly and efficient manner. We were made to feel like valued customers, which is something that many companies fail to do, nowadays. We can thoroughly recommend this dealership to everyone."
11/2/16,5,"From the outset i found the experience with Coopers York fantastic, there goal to deliver a unique customer journey based on the needs of the buyer is a refreshing change to buying a car,.

Tracy Ross (my sales manager) was professional, extremely helpful and offered genuine advice and recommendations without pushing me down one route or another, he just talked though the decisions and options to help me chose the right car for me

This is my 5th BMW (66 plate 520d M-Sport Touring this time) but the first I've bought from Coopers, and i will say without hesitation this has been the most pleasant experience of all of them, and would recommend this showroom to anyone - even if you have to travel to get there!"
11/2/16,5,Customer Service provided by Sam was excellent - very happy with overall experience.
11/2/16,5,Natasha Oliva organised the service and repair of my car. She was very professional and helpful throughout the whole process
11/2/16,5,"Alex at Cooper Thames Ditton was great. He was very helpful in suggestions as to what I'd like in building my new mini. He explained things well and it was very exciting when I picked up my new car. He offered ongoing help if needed. He didn't keep pursuing me with chase up phone calls, which was a relief and didn't try and sell me the most expensive of everything.

The only thing I'd say is that you have to phone a number for the dealership as a whole and it proved hard on a number of occasions getting any information from them if Alex wasn't available. They need access to the mini staff diaries or be able to put me through to someone who knows and can deal, if he's not available."
11/1/16,5,"The service from Inchcape Altrincham, especially James Bowyer who was very helpful and got us a great deal on a great car, was second to none. I'd definitely recommend them to others."
11/1/16,5,Second BMW from Coopers and went just as smoothly ...love the car and the service was once again faultless ...thanks Mark
11/1/16,5,Thanks to Kyle Mills on his great customer service and helping me to choose the right car for me would recommend him to anyone. 😁
11/1/16,5,"We have just taken delivery of our new A3 Sportback, our 8th Audi, and whilst we have always been impressed with the updated features on the respective cars, the showroom sales and handover experience and overall dealership service goes from strength to strength. We are always assured of a friendly welcome and great service whether it be from Reception, Sales or Servicing departments. Keep up the good work Maidstone Audi."
11/1/16,5,"Hunters are very helpful, reliable and professional."
10/31/16,5,I was well looked after by Malcolm and the team at Inchcape Stockport throughout my purchase and the after sales support has also been great. I've been treated like a VIP and most importantly have a fantastic new car which suits me perfectly. Very happy to recommend.
10/31/16,5,"I purchased a new car from Crawley Audi and I couldn't fault them at all.
Jack A was really helpful and there was no pressure to purchase. Nothing was too much trouble for Jack and he made the car choice and purchasing process very easy."
10/31/16,5,"Customer care when my TT is serviced is quite excellent and they are always extremely courteous and polite, each and every member of the team. I have owned a range of Audi since my first Audi Quattro in 1984 and the current Service Department are the best I have ever experienced."
10/31/16,5,"Had a really good experience at VW inchcape. Paul was very friendly and helpful throughout, would highly recommend them."
10/31/16,5,"Recently purchased an Audi A1 from Audi at Maidstone and can only speak highly of the service that I received from start to finish of the whole process. Andre the Sales Executive that dealt with my order was first class and nothing was too much bother for him. He was extremely pleasant, professional and helpful. I would happily recommend this branch and individual to anyone who is thinking of purchasing an Audi."
10/31/16,5,"Salesman was helpful and efficient

In all a pleasurable experience in an industry where pressure salesman are common."
10/31/16,5,"We bought our Land Rover from Paul Meacher at Hunters Norwich. What a lovely person, not once was he pushy and listened to our requirements. Paul made the whole process of buying a new car hassle free and put us at ease. We would be confident buying from Hunters Norwich in the future.
Love the new car, probably the first car we have been excited about getting and enjoy driving.

Alex and Bill"
10/31/16,4,Have just bought my 3rd Auris from Toyota in Oxford. Have had excellent service from them and can't recommend the car enough - their hybrid is all it says it is. Have only given them 4 stars as there is a design change in the new Auris that I didn't spot and that was crucial to my choice which they knew - a well has been created in the back of the estate and the back seats no longer lie flat - not easy for getting my golf clubs in and out and could have been a game changer if I had noticed!
10/31/16,5,"I found the whole buying experience at Inchcape Volkswagen excellent. The staff are very knowledgeable and helpful in everyway,I can't thank them enough."
10/31/16,5,"Every single member of staff is courteous, pleasant, friendly and helpful.
Full marks!"
10/31/16,5,My car was picked up from and delivered back home on time; friendly expert staff who clearly knew Mercedes cars. This service from Inchcape was exemplary.
10/31/16,5,"Dropped my car off to have the emissions software resolved. A warm welcome and prompt service. Was told that it was going to be ready at 4pm. I asked for my rear reverse bulb to be replaced, which they seemed happy to do and only charged me for the part, no labour. Got a text, email and phone call at 12 midday saying my car was ready for collection. Also got a great little video about the health check, and even replaced a couple of bolts that were missing for free. Car was ready for collection, and near the exit so I could leave promptly. Fab fab fab service!!!"
10/31/16,5,Recently bought a BMW 530D from Thames Ditton branch of Coopers. Nothing was too much trouble and the experience was good. We had a small issue with the price but this was resolved quickly and professionally. Would recommend. Thanks Ajay for looking after us.
10/31/16,5,Just bought a new C Class Cabriolet from Paul at Southport Mercedes Benz. It was an impulse buy seeing it in the showroom window. The service and consideration from him was excellent. It was a pleasure to deal with him and we are delighted with our new car.
10/31/16,5,"I have given a score of Excellent
Because it thoroughly well deserved by Inchcape VW Swindon.
I returned with confidence to this dealership.
All the staff are friendly and and very helpful.
Special thanks to Chris Kilworth who made the experience of new car buying an absolute pleasure. I felt like a V.I.P as I took delivery of my new Tiguan
The personal video is a very nice idea.
All stages of the process were explained to me. And I was kept upto date with all aspects of delivery times etc.
I would highly recommend this dealership for its excellent customer service."
10/31/16,5,"Purchased an AUDI A6 from them. Excellent service with no pressure
selling unlike most of their competitors. Their sales representative was informative and dedicated, ask for David King."
10/31/16,5,"Third car from Inchcape Toyota Sandhurst. Good non pressured discussions and fair negotiations on part exchange. Also the after sales service and help and advice has been excellent.
A company you can trust"
10/31/16,5,"Apart from brilliant cars and a lovely showroom, which I always look forward to looking around, the team at Cooper Cobham are friendly, professional and organised. Booking a service is very simple and I have never had reason to doubt the quality of the work. The prices are reasonable too. I look forward to them giving me a very generous valuation on my current car an amazing deal on a new one in the near future :-)"
10/31/16,4,"Very pleasant experience with staff that always seem caring, attentive and a willingness to help. I would have given 5 stars but for the inconvenience of not having a courtesy car available and forgetting an agreement to collect my car from home and re-deliver it back after the service. This meant that I had to drive it to Audi in the morning, although Audi arranged a free taxi back home, and seek a lift back into Audi in the afternoon to collect my car. More courtesy cars please !!!"
10/31/16,5,"The service provided in organising my new BMW including the handover to me, was excellent."
10/31/16,5,"Great dealership with vast stocks and examples to look at if you are undecided on exact colour or extras wanted

Highly recommend"
10/31/16,5,"Our Sales Advisor, Ms Mojdeh Kareme, was fantastic from the start of our visit until delivery of our newly purchased Touran. She sits us down comfortably, even personally serves us drinks, before starting to get our requirements on a car. This is our second car purchase from Inchcape Volkswagen (West London)

Mojdeh was very patient and listens to each and every detail of what we want from our second car. In the week or so when we were deciding on the car, she either phones or sends email to help us decide and answers any other concerns that we might want to have answer for without feeling ""pushed"".

To summarise it all, we are happy with the experience and finally with the purchase of our Touran.

Mrs. Lourdes Lopez-Vito"
10/31/16,5,Excellent customer service. Faultless in every way. Couldn't do enough to help always available when requested. Will definitely be going back when we want another car. Top marks for Adrian!!!!!
10/31/16,5,"Overall, very happy with the purchase of the car and service. Sales Executive very relaxed and helpful. The process and paperwork very straightforward and quick. Buying through Volkswagen has given me great piece of mind and I would certainly go back when considering and upgrade."
10/31/16,4,"I booked my car in for the long overdue software update and the service was very good as usual - the staff at Inchcape are unfailingly polite and attentive. However, I was kept waiting half an hour for my car to be ready, even though I had been called to say that I could pick it up? In fairness, that's the first time this has happened and it doesn't change my view that this dealership does a very good job."
10/30/16,5,"Bought a new car and am very happy with everything. Good communication throughout and Wasif the new car sale consultant was always there to respond to queries and questions, by both emails and phone calls, even late in the evenings. Never had any problem getting an update of the order and an estimate on when the car would be handed over. Due to work schedule I was only able to collect the car after 6:30PM on a Monday and there was no problem with that either. The car was prepared in immaculate condition and the final transaction was easy and professional. Highly recommended to everyone and will definitely use again."
10/30/16,5,Excellent efficient service keeping me up to date on the progress of my cars service
10/30/16,5,Great experience. Highly delighted with the car. Service was great. Strewert Lane made buying the car easy and stress free. Can't recommend the dealership highly enough. Thanks very much!
10/30/16,5,I had a great experience made all the better by a good professional sales rep who dealt with all my questions queries and needs superbly
10/30/16,5,"After finding a screw in the tyre a garage in Warrington suggested a new tyre was required but lucky for me they did not have one in. I phoned Inchscape Audi and spoke to Bernadette who squeezed me into Stockport's busy schedule and noticed that some software updates were due so tagged these to the job as well.
Upon dropping the car Danielle guessed who I was as I came through the door making me feel welcome, expected and important to them as a customer. Through the day Danielle kept me informed of progress and Anthony sent me a nice video of the work required and as it turned out the tyre was repairable. The whole experience felt very red carpet and Audi Stockport saved me money to boot. Collection was easy and I was shown to my lovely valeted car.
Thanks to all involved for turning an annoying frustration into a pleasurable experience. It was my first time at Audi Stockport but they made me feel like a VIP customer and exceeded my expectations throughout."
10/30/16,5,"Early start at 7.30 am and met by friendly,experienced staff member (Donna). Courtesy card was available and I was able to enjoy my day before collecting my own car spotlessly cleaned in the afternoon."
10/30/16,5,"Mahmoud Ghrab was fantastic and a real asset for the dealership. Regular updates and his ""video updates"" were a real nice touch. Mahmoud went out of his way to make the car purchase a real treat as it should be."
10/29/16,5,Brilliant! There is no doubt that Oliver Gutierez is a star!!
10/29/16,5,"I have recently purchased a Mercedes SLC250AMG. From my meeting with Asher Feather I received a highly commendable service that was professional throughout. I was offered a test drive and bought the vehcile immediately. I am very satisfied with both the product, the sales and aftercare."
10/29/16,5,"The sales process was easy.
Chris our sales person was helpful, informative and polite at all stages.
I would recommend Inchape Bolton to anyone thinking of buying a VW in the Northwest."
10/29/16,5,Having bought our first Mercedes for my husband from the dealership in Nottingham 2 months ago the service and attention to detail has been second to none. It was so good we bought another 2 weeks ago for me. Would recommend to anyone nothing is too much trouble and everything is done with a smile.
10/29/16,5,"All promises met with staff trying to do all that is possible to make the experience pleasurable. On booking, it was suggested I had a brake oil change but while doing the work found it had been done last time. Thank you for not re-doing it in these dishonest times."
10/28/16,5,"Very good service, kept informed of the process and picked up from station when went to collect the car.
Car is fantastic"
10/28/16,5,"In the murky world of car sales Inchcape Bolton were a shining light! We'd been to two other German car specialists in Warrington( Wowdi and Beemer)on the day before and had been really disappointed with their sales teams efforts. We went on CarWow, got a price and an offer from Inchcape so made the drive over to Bolton. Within 5 minutes of meeting Stuart W we knew it was the place to part with our money. Honest, not pushy and then helpful when we decided to buy from them.
I wont spoil the experience but if you ever buy from Inchcape they have a special surprise for you on handover day. Brilliant."
10/28/16,5,"Excellent service from Stefan in the Sales team who put an excellent package which caused me to buy my new BMW from the Cobham dealership rather than my own local dealership.
Communication has been excellent throughout the purchase process and all my queries were answered quickly and throughly.
Thank you very much to the entire Cobham team but especially Stefan who gives an excellent service from start to finish. Cant recommend them highly enough"
10/28/16,3,"Sales person was good and very helpful but had a technical issue with the media system and 3 calls, 2 emails later no response from the technical team. Disappointing as customer care these days as important as taking the sale."
10/27/16,5,"I was kept informed through the whole process which was very efficient!!!!
The Jaguar is brilliant !"
10/27/16,5,"Nice touch to be met on my arrival by a friendly gentleman who knew my name and escorted me to the service department. Chow the service receptionist was a credit to the department, friendly and knowledgeable. My husband was also impressed by the quality of the valet, the car looked like new .
Thoroughly recommend after a bad experience at Jardine Audi service in Manchester!"
10/27/16,5,"Just had a MOT completed at Inchcape Chelmsford. I was called up beforehand in plenty of time to book in and received text message and email reminders. Amanda even called me the day before to check that I wasn't worried/concerned about anything on the car. The day of the MOT was seamless - I was booked in quickly at 9.30 (I had a poorly two year old in tow) and the lady (didn't know her name but was v nice!) reassured me I wouldn't be collecting during the school run/meal times. I also mentioned in passing about my payment plan (Amanda later followed that up with a call). The car was ready by 2pm to collect and was cleaned throughout - Amanda was there to do the handover and I feel she really looks after me well. In fact, I would be disappointed to have someone else deal with our car now! Excellent all round service."
10/27/16,5,"The whole experience of purchasing our new vehicle at Hunters Derby, was totally hassle and stress free. This was mainly down to the very knowledgeable and customer focused Sales Executive Lee Blanchard.
It is certainly a company I would recommend to anyone."
10/27/16,5,"Called in on the off chance to look at new Toyota's, approached by Daniel who offered me a tremendous deal on my car for a new Toyota.
I was not put under any pressure and left about an hour later, after a little negotiations and a better deal, with a new car.
Couldn't have been easier."
10/27/16,4,"I made an appointment to update the software on my Tiguan.
The receptionists are courteous, efficient, very professional and clear. The cherry on the cake somehow.
I received a video showing me what needed to be addressed on the car. Again very clear, professional etc.. A tyre had a screw and needed to be changed urgently . I was told they cannot keep tyres in stock. Hence, I called Malvern tyres and went there directly, they changed the two rear tyres in 20 minutes.
What message does it give to the customer ? It means that the customer has to go somewhere else to fix the problem. They should find a way to stock their parts. Either they say, your car has a screw but we can order the tyre for you and and meanwhile you can drive with this screw with no problem. Or they could say, we do not have spare parts but if you wish to wait we will find a solution, we will shop around for you, find the tyre and change it for you.
At the end of the day, it should be about them finding solutions and not up to the customer to do so."
10/27/16,5,"Great experience. Paul Brotherton is a very helpful, polite guy. Easy to get on with, informative and excellent on test drive as I had never driven an automatic before. Kept in touch as promised, paperwork and delivery straight forward. Just made the whole experience excellent. Thank you"
10/27/16,5,"I spent a lot of time and effort researching what new car I wanted to meet the needs of my family but that was also something that I got pleasure from.

By the time I stepped through the door of Cheshire oaks Audi, I had been in many other showrooms. The difference in the service was clear instantly and that was the beginning of what was a very positive experience.

Love my new car, fantastic overall efficient service, enough attention but not pressured at any point. The excellent sales executive Henry Hughes made the whole experience as positive as it could be and I will be returning my business and recommending not only this branch of Audi, but also his service."
10/26/16,5,"Contact made when we arrived, for a look at the used car sellection which was laid out well with good information for cars listed on the window. Asked if there were any offers and were shown the nearly new cars. The next day we came in for a test drive of one of the nearly new cars which we agreed to purchase. After a week of poor service from the finance company we chose to use the communication between us and the dealer was awesome. We agreed to pick up the car the following weekend. On arrival we were welcomed with a hot beverage every time with no exception when we came to collect the car and sign the relevant paperwork. Special thanks go to Jake @ Coopers BMW Norwich for being with all the way from when we arrived to have look to collecting the car with the in depth run through of everything we needed to now about the car to get us on our way. Thanks."
10/26/16,5,"Very good service. Very helpfull staff, rick was very helpfull. Would reccomend to all.

Thanks"
10/26/16,5,"Introduced to Lexus Guildford by my son, a loyal customer of theirs. Told them my 'wants' and was shown 1 second hand car that was so right I paid the deposit and am enjoying my purchase very much. Great customer service and thoroughly recommended dealership."
10/26/16,5,"Only popped in for recall on car, very friendly and helpfully job done no fuss and nice clean car back. Coffee was lovely"
10/25/16,5,"Bought Passat Estate last week, for a change it was a pleasure rather than a chore. Dealt with Isaac in Oldham, nice friendly helpful guy. Also not too much paperwork, which kept my valuable time to a minimum.
Hope hes going to help me now with changing over my Cherished plate."
10/25/16,5,"Collection and delivery service was excellent by a very smart, polite and professional driver. Information email from the service technician during the service advising of potential issues was most welcome. Car arrived back in showroom condition. Cannot praise Crawley Audi enough - excellent service team."
10/25/16,4,"We were delighted with the time, care and attention paid by the Salesman. We required a Factory order. This was achieved in unbelievably quick time. We were very satisfied with Trade-In offer and pricing deal. We like a Relationship Management approach to major purchases, but were disappointed to find that the corporate policy was to delegate Handovers to other staff. We had to return car for the Rear Camera to be adjusted. We would have expected this error to have been found in the pre-Handover checks. Otherwise, we were very satisfied. The Salesman did an excellent job."
10/25/16,5,"First time buying a car and usually I would be taken advantage of, being a young girl with very little knowledge of cars. But, at VW Bury the salesmen made sure I had all the information I needed before I made any decisions with no pressure applied, it was all on my terms with helpful salesmen there to support me through every stage. Even after I have bought the car the support continues. Highly recommend. Thank you all at VW Bury, especially Tony and Arron who helped me through the process."
10/25/16,5,"Just taken delivery of a new GLC AMG Line and have been absolutely delighted with both the car and the service I received from Anna McMullen. Having been a longtime service customer of this dealership and having been looked after superbly, I had no hesitation in choosing this dealership to supply my new car."
10/25/16,5,"I recently upgraded my car to a Jaguar XF. All staff at the dealership were friendly, helpful and professional, understood my needs and worked hard to come up with the right deal. Ryan Blake in Sales did a great job with test drives and sales info.and was supported very well by Nathan when negotiating the deal.
All staff were friendly and efficient and it was nice to be welcomed back into the Jaguar world by Paul in Service.
Great experience all round."
10/25/16,5,"Appointmentnot immediately available but very good and pleasant service, competitive value and complementary wash and vacuum. Very pleased."
10/25/16,4,"Great service from start to finish and the car came back sparkling inside and out which was an added bonus.
I went for the pick up and drop off this time, as previously I took the car in myself but the wait to book the car in was too long and in the end I had to just leave as I was going to be late for work.
The pick up and drop off option went without hitch and I was kept informed of exactly what was happening throughout the service.
I was sent a video of my car on a ramp, not really sure of the point in that. So for me that was a waste of time and effort. Otherwise a smooth, seamless process!"
10/24/16,5,"I never considered buying a BMW - Before I have had a Rover, Insignia and lastly a Jaguar. However since my son purchased a 1 series, was bowled over by coopers customer experience, even if I wasn't at first bowled over by BMWs.
I have now purchased a 435d x-drive and 'wow' what a car to go with the excellent customer experience and a million thx to Nathan Roberts."
10/24/16,5,"Looking to purchase out first brand new car, also our first BMW. From the moment we walked into the showroom in Preston Farm, Teesside we were very well looked after, despite being an extremely busy day. The staff were attentive, our needs were carefully considered and options explained. We took our time, were never pressured and found the car for us. Nick Jimson even came up with a great plan to surprise our (car crazy) autistic 13 yr old son, who was blown away to learn the car he thought we were test driving, was indeed ours for collection. The look on his face was priceless! (Nick, you deserve an Oscar)! We've since received follow up calls to check all is well and couldn't be happier with our gorgeous car. All in all, we're very happy customers and will no doubt be back in 3-4 years for a new car again."
10/24/16,5,"Very straight forward new car purchase. I was kept fully informed throughout, and the people working at VW Bury were so kind and helpful. I live in London and have now bought two cars over the years at VW Bury - It was well worth making the 400 mile round trip up on both occasions. Thank you so much to Paul, Steven and Jill."
10/24/16,5,"As always the customer service is excellent . I was dealt with by Ryan who is very informative, helpful and professional. . Would highly recommend this company tor anybody"
10/24/16,5,"I have an old mini one, which Coopermini at Chelmsford have serviced, mot'd, repaired, several times now. The work has always been completed on time and a courtesy vehicle available when needed. I would never go back to an ordinary garage now for any work to be done, as they have never matched Coopermini's standard."
10/24/16,5,it was a good service with pleasant and friendly staff
10/24/16,5,"Flawless,great communication, efficient and very friendly. They make my busy schedule hassle free."
10/24/16,5,"I cannot fault the service from first phone call, through test drive, collection and handover and then a minor problem aftersales which was resolved almost instantly. Thanks Chris New."
10/24/16,5,"I was extremely happy with my VW Polo, which had been supplied by Inchcape, Altrincham approx. two and a half years ago. I have recently upgraded to a VW Polo TSI. The entire process was hassle free, handled by their sales executive Dave Clarke - an asset to the company."

10/24/16,5,Excellent service from Richard Knight. Highly recommended.
10/24/16,5,"A very proffesional and friendly dealership and service centre. All staff are polite knowledgeable and efficient. I purchased my XF from them with 30,000 miles on the clock and drive about 40,000 miles per year. Their serving is absolutely first class, dealing directly with all manufacturers issues without making a fuss and at no charge to the customer.I wouldnt go anywhere else. The main dealer premiun hourly rate more than pays for itself in service and efficiency."
10/24/16,5,"Very impressed with the customer service. Was greeted by name at the door, kept fully updated throughout and was treated as a valuable client. There are many companies who could take a leaf from their book on how to treat clients. Will definitely keep going back."
10/24/16,5,Requested competitive quote outside my local area. Quickly provided a very good offer which I accepted. All the paperwork was dealt with remotely which made things easier for me. I dealt with several staff - all of them including front desk and sales honoured their commitments. Impressed!
10/24/16,5,"Very pleased with my CT200h and the service was excellent.
Flowers were a lovely touch and I felt valued as a customer."
10/24/16,5,"Put simply, the best experience I have ever received at a car dealership"
10/24/16,5,"I booked my car in for a service and I only expected to collect it much later in the day. I was surprised to receive a call just after midday advising my car was ready for collection.

When I arrived to collect it, I was presented with a nice clean car, ready to drive away.

I was very happy"
10/23/16,5,"Handover experience was absolutely amazing, thank you Shane and thank you west London Volkswagen."
10/23/16,5,"A first class service from all at cooper mini malton, especially to Jack and Jordan, no pushy sales techniques just honest and helpful advise from start to finish, Jack went above and beyond to ensure the car was ready and all the docs completed for delivery date and kept us up to date every step of the way, a real pleasure to deal with and made buying our new mini an enjoyable experience even with the kids! Can't recommend enough, will definitely return when the time is right to look at our next car. Thanks again."
10/22/16,5,"I have now had two cars serviced at Cooper. They are the 4th BMW dealership I have tried in the southeast, and so far they have been excellent. They are attentive, good at communication, professional, and most importantly, my car just gets serviced as it should in a hassle-free way. This is all I ask. I trust Cooper with my cars, more than any other BMW dealership I have used. I just want my car sorted quickly and with no hassle. They provide this. If you are considering, give them a try and see what I mean. Thank you Cooper Cobham."
10/22/16,5,"Ordered my 66 reg Polo Beats in August 2016 and car delivered October 18th due to delayed shipping which was not the fault of the branch. Adam Jones my sales executive went above and beyond his duty in that he kept me up to date regularly, gave me his personal car to use whilst I waited for my car to arrive (as there were no company courtesy cars available) and provided a professional, high standard service throughout. I am very happy with my car and couldn't fault the service from this branch."
10/22/16,5,Customer service was excellent throughout
10/21/16,5,From walking in to leaving the service was second to none..first time buying a Audi .will not be the last .
10/21/16,5,Lee M. gave us excellent guidance throughout the acquisition of our new VW Golf Estate which was delivered to our home on Wednesday. Darren's loving the drive to/from work and I am looking forward to our journey across to Brittany next week!
10/21/16,5,Just recently bought an SLK from Inchcape Llandudno. Excellent service and advice throughout transaction. Though I have bought 3 Mercs previously I have never had such a thorough vehicle handover with so much care taken to explain the veicle's features.
10/20/16,5,"Richard Avis (Hornchurch)
Bought my last two vehicles from here,got looked after extremely well."
10/20/16,5,"From being greeted immediately at Reception, I was introduced to the member of staff who would be looking after me whilst my Mini was being serviced. Nicole explained exactly what would be taking place and how long the procedure was likely to take. I was offered a comfortable seat and a delicious cup of coffee whilst I read my book and watched the news headlines on the TV in the waiting area. Nicole came back to me a couple of times whilst I was waiting to reassure me that all was going well and that my car would be ready at the indicated time. An excellent experience."
10/20/16,5,"A member of staff (Angela) guided us through the process of our V.W.'s first service including updates that were needed. Minor concerns we had with the car were discussed and put right during its service. The car was cleaned for us and the whole process took almost exactly the time Angela said it would.

All the members of staff we came into contact with were cheerful and helpful. Couldn't ask for more. Thank you."
10/20/16,5,"We dealt with Chris Gomez at CooperBMW on the purchase of the vehicle.

His customer service skills were outstanding and even after purchase he is as willing to help as before - he is always easy to get hold of by telephone too, which is a bonus nowadays"
10/20/16,5,"Happy to recommend Guildford Lexus. The service is generally faultless, even though their success means they are far busier now than used to be the case. We like the new car too, the current RX450h seems far superior to the previous model."
10/20/16,5,"Car booked for MOT. In previous fortnight's road trip to Scotland many, many more miles had been driven than planned ==> computer was now saying 'service' (hadn't been expected until 6-8 weeks hence).

Upon arrival, reception noted that service was now due and asked whether I'd like to have job done at same time as MOT or could they book a separate appointment. Opted for service there and then ==> car was MOT'd and serviced within 2hr 30mins whilst I waited in their comfortable customer are, utilising the free wifi and being fed copious cups of coffee by friendly receptionist.

Findings of MOT and service both explained in full whilst car was being fully valeted (interior & exterior).

Pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient service throughout. Was later that evening sent a video of the one identified point for further work/consideration - taken by technician whilst car was on ramp, so the point that had been passed on verbally in the dealership could now be viewed in detail, with audio commentary from the technician.

Overall the service I received can't be faulted and I shall have my vehicle serviced there when next due."
10/20/16,5,"From initial speculative viewing of showroom models through to final hand-over of a new car, sales executive Neil Cameron was very thorough, patient with my stream of queries, and most helpful.

10/20/16,5,"excellent customer attention, staff ""Clair"" was attentive and friendly making my wait comfortable."
10/19/16,5,Never had service like we get from Bolton Audi. From telephone to book the car in to to the courtesy call the day after collection. The staff are all attentive and professional. the service is exemplary. and my car always looks a lot better coming back than it did going in :-)
10/19/16,5,"First time I'd dropped the car in for a scheduled service, went exactly to plan & and as described. Really good service - little things, a decent coffee, a lift into town, as well as being kept up to date on the service with a video link, being proactive about a warranty issue, and a complementary external valet. Very good."

10/18/16,5,"Excellent experience in buying a used SLK - Stewart in sales listened to what I wanted and kept in touch until we found the right car!
Collecting the car was really good and everything was explained to me in great detail.

Would recommend the Dealership and Stewart."
10/18/16,5,"Every time I go the Hunters it's always great service, great cars and great coffee."
10/17/16,5,"I've always had family hand me downs so I've not bought a new car before, I also don't know much about cars in general. And so when I decided to treat myself to a new car I had planned to take my time and visit a number of showrooms before deciding on a make and model. Mini Cooper Ipswich was the first garage I visited and Heather was my salesperson. Heather was extremely patient with me, was very happy to explain what might be to most people obvious and took her time to understand what was important to me. She made good suggestions when I was struggling to make my mind up. When the car that I wanted wasn't available she went to great lengths to ensure there was an even better alternative. Owing to her bubbly personality, good product knowledge and excellent customer service I bought a car there and then and so far have not regretted it at all. So thank you Heather."
10/17/16,5,"Buying a BMW in Cobham continues to be a very pleasant experience and this time was especially nice , dealing with the consultant Kevin. He was exceptionally pleasant and patient with my questions. He explained the financial details extremely well and was very sympathetic to my different requirements. The car is great and I love it. The attention to details is second to none and the manager was very clear and helpful on the extra bonus items he offered.
Thank you
Maggie."

Would be very hard to change from Mercedes to any other car company."
10/17/16,5,"Polite and efficient staff. Nothing is too much trouble and apart from a service and MOT being completed without any hassle the car was also valeted.
Can't find any fault with Mini Cooper Tonbridge!"
10/17/16,5,"Have bought my last 6 cars from their Bolton branch on each occasion have dealt with Stuart In sales honest no messing cannot fault him.

The staff in after sales/service also know their stuff and are a great help."
10/17/16,5,"What can I say ? Superbly helpful in ALL aspects. Stephen Shortland was extremely helpful and courteous, chatty and friendly throughout, explaining everything as we went along.

Customer service at its best. Thank you"

10/17/16,5,"I picked up my mini on Friday and it's in my top three of best purchases, it's been a dream to drive and I really like the little touches I'll probably be discovering the hidden quirks for sometime! Lauren was the sales executive who dealt with my initial enquiry, I really appreciated the laid back sales approach, I had time to consider my options and had all queries answered in a straight forward way. Overall, it's been a great experience and apart from the brand, the buying experience was just as enjoyable."
10/17/16,5,"I have recently had the first service on my Mercedes and chose the Warrington dealer to perform this. The customer service was first class, i was telephoned the day before to confirm that a driver would be with me at 8.45am to collect my car, he arrived at 8.45am on the dot, the car was returned shortly after lunch after again being telephoned to advise me when to expect it back. The work was done to a high standard and the car was pristine inside and out. Great work all round highly recommended."

10/15/16,5,That I have just taken delivery of my sixth car from the same dealer tells you most of what you need to know about them. Always a friendly face and the team persevere if you have a particular need in a car. My best revommendation is that I will be back. Others in my family also use them and have for several years. Keep up the good work.
10/15/16,5,"HA Fox York were Attentive and personal without being pushy
Very good
James Slater thank you"
10/15/16,5,"It was worth the long trip to Macclesfield Audi, got a really fare deal, not like my local dealers, rip off merchants. the greeting I got when I walked to reception , everyone was so cheerful and helpful , would like to thank David Singh, the car was everything he said it was, he was so helpful from start to finish made buying a car a pleasure not a hassle, like at a lot of garages, also would like to thank the person in the parts dept, sorry did not get your name infact all the staff I met were great, will definateley be getting my next Audi from Macclesfield Audi"
10/15/16,5,"I had booked and pre-paid online for a category B drive service and can honestly say that itself was an easy thing to do. Thereafter Inchcape's
pre-service attention, the service itself and after care was exemplary and I simply cannot fault them and naturally would definitely recommend and use them again! An easy 5 star award!"
10/15/16,5,"The assistance and care I received from Mercedes Chester was outstanding.

10/13/16,5,"In the pouring rain I risked viewing and testing an X1.
The receptionists were on the ball as it was a very busy showroom and found me sales consultant Haytham Ibrahim. He was knowledgeable and very helpful and came with me on a short test drive. The car had almost everything (sadly, no pan roof) that I was looking for and we began negotiations as I was trading in a BMW. He was forthright and patient and we finally agreed a deal. On the following Monday I signed up and paid for the car that needed the BMW checks, MOT, warranty etc which would take 4 days. As I live 140 miles away ( I was visiting my daughter in Thames Ditton) Haytham to my surprise offered to deliver the car to my door.
Several emails and 4 days later, Haytham arrived as promised with a big smile, an immaculately presented car and left me with a full tank.
On this occasion I couldn't have wished for a better car-buying experience.
Thanks to all."
10/13/16,4,"I fell out with Cooper Cobham earlier in the year when my BMW's wheels failed and there was some upset caused by misinformation and what I considered to be a change of heart by one of the advisers resulting in a £1200 charge for two faulty wheels to be replaced. After a lot of fighting with BMW the service manager at Cobham contacted me and offered to refund one of the wheels out of good will...... So I made a decision to not buy another BMW but that is not Coopers fault - BMW don't put their customers first and allow a known fault with Cracking Alloy wheels to continue...... The service became due and so I booked the car in for a big service, taking a ""while you wait"" slot and when I arrived settled in for the long wait which was put at 2 hours and made the most of the free tea and coffee and Wifi.
Kayleigh Widdowson and her colleague were incredibly busy and I watched as they jumped from one customer and phone call to the next - I overheard that there were briefings going on and a number of people were unavailable, everything was dropping on these Ladies shoulders and it was a mighty impressive show of professionalism and multitasking - People were treated as individuals and real care seemed to be taken to do the right thing with customers - I have a thing about great service as I run a business with staff that I insist do the right things for visitors,
Kayleigh was perfect no matter what was thrown her way - even walking customers out to their cars regardless of the pile of jobs coming across her desk and the lack of support from anyone else (apart from her blond colleague) My car was ready as planned, I got everything explained and for the first time in a few visits to Cooper showrooms felt appreciated and valued. Well done Kayleigh, I hope that you get some support and a bit of a pat on the back in the future!"
10/13/16,5,"What can you say about a team that has it right. Good service from start to finish. Well informed, on time. We had our car collected, what a great chap!! very polite. He drove my car with great care and respect. Thank you Team."
10/13/16,5,"I first decided to contact HA Fox, York after visiting their website and became interested in one of their used approved vehicles/ On making telephone contact with the dealership, I became aware of the friendly and helpful staff.
As a direct result, I made an appointment to view and test drive my selected vehicle. At that point I was told the name of the sales person who would look after me. On arrival at the premises, my wife and I were met by the designated salesman, Johnathan, and were immediately made to feel very welcome,
Johnathan was extremely helpful and over the next few days, guided us through the purchase of our first Jaguar. I got the impression that nothing was too much trouble.
Prior to the day of collection, arrangements were made to complete all the necessary paper work. As a result when I collected the car all went as smooth as clockwork.
That visit to HA Fox, York was my first experience of a Jaguar dealership and I can only say that I was extremely impressed with the service that I received. I would not hesitate to recommend them to other prospective buyers."
10/13/16,5,Great service by Sean Costello! Would recommend to anyone looking for a VW.
10/13/16,5,I love my cars. I really love my cars. I never let anyone drive them. BUT I do trust Mercedes of Derby to service them. I have 2 AMGs and they always swervice them at a good price and they come back clean and looking like I would expect a prestige car to look. Ask for Jamie or Neville.
10/13/16,5,"I had been puzzling over which used BMW to purchase. I had in mind a few basic essentials but beyond that I had not decided which model. My wife and I were poking about looking through the windows of X1s, Series 1, 3, 5 (and even 7 wasn't off my list of possibilities).
Daniel Gibson appeared and, without being pushy in any way, helped us to select from the available stock a vehicle that more than exceeded our needs at a price that was well within our budget.
We were very much at the bottom end in terms of outlay, even for a used car, but at no time were we made to feel second class in any way. Had I been purchasing a new series 7 with every extra I could not have expected better attention than we received from Daniel G.
If you are interested in a BMW, go to Cooper."
10/13/16,5,"Thank you Mini Boldon,Sunderland
Initially went to the showroom to view but not to buy although we had a good idea that we wanted a Mini Countryman. The selection of new and used cars was vast. We spotted a Countryman which was the model and colour we hoped we could buy.
Charlotte Morris, sales executive, was in the forecourt and without any pressure took us through all the features of the Countryman which were just what we wanted. Her patience and professionalism even extended to showing us how the radio and Bluetooth worked, which was very useful. After the completion of the sale Charlotte rang to ask if there were any questions. I'm sure I'll find some to ask her when she next phones.
A very easy,none pressured experience. Knowledgeable staff. Well done Mini, Boldon Sunderland."
10/13/16,5,Have bought three cars from them and the service from the sales team and the service centre are truly exceptional. Was recently in for an upgrade to the media centre of my Golf and they fitted a Sat-Nav - this was done without a hitch while I waited.The staff are courteous and knowledgable and a pleasure to deal with - Well done !
10/13/16,5,"I recently bought my 435d from Kevin Perera at Cooper BMW Croydon and he could not have made the experience any easier for me. He got the balance just right of being helpful and knowledgeable but not pushy.

I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase and would even travel the distance from Lincoln to buy my next car from Kevin."
10/13/16,5,5 year service completed ahead of schedule. Can't login to Trustpilot
10/12/16,5,"It was quick and easy to book my Mini in for a service and MOT at Banstead. On arrival, I was taken through what would happen and informed that I would be consulted about a particular issue with the battery once the mechanic had started work. As I had to get back to London, I was very kindly given a lift to Epsom station - this is a brilliant service! I was telephoned during the day to give approval for a replacement battery and my car was ready to collect at the appointed time. Everyone was very helpful and charming all the way through so I have no hesitation in recommending Coopermini Banstead."
10/11/16,5,"We have experienced a friendly, helpful and efficient service from this garage. Nothing has been too much trouble for all members of the staff."
10/11/16,5,"Took my Tiguan into dealership to have an update on the hands free system a couple of weeks ago, and Victoria was very helpful, and pro active, keeping me fully informed at all times.
Had update performed last weekend , which works very well, and this time I was looked after by Amy who continued the good service.
Well Done Inchcape Shrewsbury :)"
10/11/16,5,I have known them since 2008 for buying new vehicles or service and on both accounts they have been excellent. Will definitely use them again.
10/11/16,5,"Hi I recently completed the purchase of a new Audi A1 TFSI for my wife from Inchcape in Macclesfield. David Knynaston was in charge of the sale. The car was exactly as we expected, the service exceeded our expectations. David was a delight to deal with, not only very knowledgeable, very helpful and very efficient, but also someone who was keen to get the right outcome from us. I would recommend inchcape in Macclesfield, and also recommend David."
10/10/16,5,"Thanks to Yugesh, for his hassle and jargon free approach in selling me my car. Car bought, job done. A pleasant experience."
10/10/16,5,"I found the experience of buying my 'car of choice' from Mercedes, Liverpool a 'stress free time' which was helped by the contact attention
given by the Sales Executive, who informed me regularly of the progress of the vehicle build and supplied on the date, as initially promised! Couldn't improve on this service-Mark!"
10/10/16,5,I was treated regally from start to finish
10/10/16,5,"Was made to feel welcome from first looking around, to recieving the keys to my new car. Friendly staff, extremely helpful salesman. Mr Mr McCusker was a great help when physically at Audi Swindon, but also over email. Premises were always clean, very happy customer. Would highly recommend."
10/10/16,5,"Every time I have call to visit HA Fox in Guildfrod, I can have nothing but praise for the outstanding customer service one receives and the quality of the service provided by the parts and service departments."
10/10/16,3,"The service was excellent and the experience with Inchcape Wirral was great. However, the booking arrangement was disappointing and poor. I phoned on 26/9 to book in the car and requested collection from home. I was told the earliest date was 23/10 for such a request. Why? I was told shortage of staff. I was not offered a car for the day nor a lift back home. When I suggested that this was unsatisfactory I was invited to try another dealership. Poor stuff
In the end my wife had to drive her car to take and return me - 40 miles of unnecessary mileage and inconvenience to her."
10/10/16,5,"Had a service and brakes done, all easy and very well looked after."
10/9/16,5,Martin is wonderful went that extra mile getting me a good deal paper work bought to me to sign at home as could not get to showroom Reception staff superb and so was the manager in fact all staff fantastic .
10/9/16,5,"Good advice, prompt booking, flexible on pick up."
10/9/16,5,We arrived at the Basingstoke store and were greeted by kind and helpful staff. We asked to test drive a yaris and were told there was a wait. We waited and were offered complimentary tea and coffee as well as hot chocolate. The waiting area was comfy and inviting. We didn't have to wait too long before we were off in the car. The gentleman who came with us was very knowledgeable and told us lots about the car and its features. On our return we fell in love and wanted to buy but sadly it was slightly out of our price range. Our guy twisted a few arms and we got it in budget. We were overjoyed and purchased the car. Less than a week later we went to pick up the 16 plate beauty and I drove albeit nervously the whole way home with a smile on my face. Thank you Toyota Basingstoke.
10/9/16,5,"Had a great experience when purchasing my Audi. Everyone I came in contact with were very friendly and professional. It was evident that staff are well motivated, informed and enthusiastic. Communications was excellent and was kept informed as to the car being ready. The car is superb."
10/9/16,5,The staff were courteous and the quality of the work done on my Yaris Hybrid was excellent. Comfortable waiting room facilities complemented by attractive and friendly people with copious quantities of tea and coffee.
10/8/16,5,"Recently I paid a visit to the Lexus dealer in Derby, West Midlands. I was there to browse, but following the reception I received from the used car dealer, brought a car. The great customer service and attention to my requirements in a vehicle continued even after I changed my mind and opted for a different car.

Throughout the process of part exchanging and buying my new car everything was explained, options explored and a rapport built. I was introduced to all involved in the process of sale and who could be involved in the after sale service if I opted to have the car serviced with them.

I have purchased many cars, but the service I received from Lexus in Derby was second to none. The likes of Audi and Mercedes should take note.

Would I purchase another car from this dealership? It would be my first port of call."
10/8/16,5,Easy to book a convenient time for the servicing of my Yaris with friendly & helpful staff. I was completely satisfied with the work carried out and would highly recommend this Burton dealership for sales & servicing !
10/7/16,5,The whole expirance from andy and elliot was outstanding ... great service from start to finsh could not ask for more great dealership massive thank you
10/7/16,5,"We are very happy owners of a Mini Cooper.

We would like to extend our thanks to Ian Kelly, who right from the start listened to our requirements and budget and came up with exactly the right car for us. He never pushed us, especially on budget and was completely professional and friendly at all times. He even sorted out a courtesy car for us whilst we were waiting for ours to be delivered.

Since purchase, he has called to find out if everything was OK and that we were happy with our car.

Fabulous customer service. We would definitely use CooperBMW again and recommend Ian in particular. Seamless and easy from start to finish.

Thank you"
10/7/16,5,"I have just had my SL serviced at the Chester site and have to say that the level of service was impeccable. Not only the work but the communication too and sending me a video of the underneath of the car showing me that the brakes needed attention was a great idea.

My wife's CLA is due in next so I hope this high level of service continues. Cannot recommend the Chester site highly enough."
10/7/16,5,"Just bought a new Tiguan off Gilbert Lawton in Altrincham - great service, kept up to date on the progress of the build, extremely satisfied with the whole experience."
10/7/16,5,I have just recently purchased a new car from Inchcape Warrington. My second time buying one from this dealership. I dealt with Dan Morgan who looked after me all the way. Rest assured I will be back.
10/7/16,5,Really great customer service and a hassle-free experience.
10/6/16,5,"Having enjoyed the process and experience of buying a new S7 from Audi Macclesfield, one year later I returned to them for the car's first service.

Again, Audi Macclesfield were great. From the greeting and coffee at reception, to the outstanding customer service from the servicing department, to the valeting team leaving the car gleaming and ready to go - the whole experience was a pleasure. I felt like a valued customer."
10/6/16,5,"I have recently bought a new car from Simeon at Mercedes Leicester. I can tell you how impressed I was at the customer service I received, from start to finish of the process nothing was ever too much trouble.

I cannot recommend Simeon and the team enough for the service they offer. Refreshing change"
10/6/16,5,"The service I have had from Reading Mini so far has been fantastic! I'm not good at quick desicions and they have been patient, never pushy, taken to time talk through things with me and run different options and I am now looking forward to getting my new Mini very shortly. All the staff I have dealt with at Reading have been great! They've all been knowledgeable, really friendly and super enthusiastic about Minis!!!
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this dealer ship and Mini to anyone."
10/6/16,5,"Superior customer service every time I have dealt with them and a really great looking building, I will continue to use them for all my Audi needs."
10/6/16,5,"Free Safety check carried out and I was fully informed what was going on.
Excellent service, Great staff."
10/6/16,5,"Without doubt the best purchase experience I have ever had. Neil Cameron was exceptional. Tireless and approachable at all times. Most importantly he located and sold me the car that I wanted and needed rather than the one he wanted to sell me. Always cheerful and polite, he made the whole process an enjoyable experience. He negotiated me an excellent deal. No hesitation in recommending him to others, already have. Not sure whether I needed the videos though!"
10/5/16,5,From start to finish the standard of customer service was very good. Taking time to explain all works required and likely costs. Will definitely use again.
10/5/16,5,"My experience with Toyota at Inchcape was outstanding.
Friendly and helpful staff. Steve Holler in particular guided me through the whole process.

I would definitely recommend InchcapeToyota to anybody


George Henshaw"
10/5/16,5,"Buying a new/different car is always a stressful experience in my view, but I have to say that my first experience of buying a BMW was far from this. My time spent dealing with the people at CooperBMW at Croydon was very pleasant and the team were extremely helpful. There was never a pressure to buy a car but a willingness to understand my needs and requirements and to try and meet these.
I am now a proud owner of a new 430d and loving it....
So a big thank you to Mark Jackson and the BMW team at Cooper Croydon."
10/4/16,5,"Really happy with the service and ultimately the car I received. Would buy here again. Cheers Tom :
)"
10/4/16,5,"Fantastic service, nothing to much trouble, I would recommend this garage to anyone."
10/4/16,5,"We recently bought our second hand volkswagen golf from Inchcape Bolton. The sales rep Mo was very helpful, and could not do more to make us feel at ease. Great customer service."
10/4/16,5,"We had a disappointing experience with the Audi franchise closer to home and so it was refreshing to meet Neil Cameron when we called into Macclesfield Audi, on impulse, when passing through Macclesfield on another mission. He was attentive, polite and assisted us in specifying a new A3 which arrived faster than anticipated. Very impressed by the car which was beautifully presented. From the reception to the service department everyone at Macclesfield Audi were polite and helpful."
10/4/16,5,"Just like to say that Ben Culpin was a really helpful and excellent sales guy, helping me through the purchase of my new car last week at the Warrington showroom. Great deal as well - thank you."
10/4/16,2,"Not the best experience with Bmw garage, have one problem fixed only to be told that there was more problems. The problems were different within one week, no consistency. They had also ordered wrong part so car had to stay in overnight and went to complain to manager in Bmw garage and no manager present so waiting for a call back."
10/4/16,5,"From the start they were friendly, accommodating and professional. I will be an Audi customer for a long time yet..."
10/4/16,5,"After purchasing our previous car new from a main dealer and now experiencing the Coopermini service, there is no comparison. From stepping into the well designed show room and greeted by the lovely welcoming reception staff to the final purchase, the whole experience was enjoyable.
We purchased our car from Mini Norwich. We predominantly dealt with Michael, who was very polite, informative and helpful and went over and above to get the spec right for us (Not your average pushy sale man) but all the staff we came in contact with to do with the sale were very professional and courteous and extremely helpful too."
10/4/16,5,"This is the third vehicle that I have purchased from Mercedes-Benz at Nottingham, and as always the level of service received from John Wiles and Jonathan Ramsey was exceptional. Made to feel welcome every time you visit, and always happy to help with any query. Even after you have purchased the car. Nothing is too much trouble for them, and each time I attend to collect my new car, they make sure its an experience I will never forget. Cannot thank them enough. Excellent service team as well, I have my car on a service plan for that very reason."
10/3/16,5,"After recently acquiring a GLE and arranging a service plan my car was booked in for it's first service. I am happy to say that the experience was without fault from start to finish. Andy Hutton met me in reception at Chester and went through the process, explaining exactly what would be carried and when I could expect a call to confirm that the service was complete. The level of service from Andy and his team was first class throughout and my GLE was returned to me as though it had just been driven out of the showroom."
10/3/16,5,"Visited HA Fox for first ever Jaguar service experience and found it all very friendly and simple.
Allen Joslin"
10/3/16,5,Very helpful when buying secondhand VW
10/3/16,5,"Lexus Nottingham always look after you, not just when you purchase a vehicle but beyond. Knowledgeable service staff (Julie) give you options to sort any issues you may have, you're greeted with a smile and a coffee and your car is cleaned on return. I hear many bad experiences from friends who have other premium vehicles and once they have their car the service side is poor. This certainly hasn't been my experience with Lexus that's why I have kept coming back for the last 10 years."
10/3/16,5,We had a first class experience. Richard Piper was fantastic given the right level of professionalism and attention. From receiving quote to driving away could not have been any more straightforward. I would definitely recommend him.
10/3/16,5,"I recently had my car MOT'd with Audi Cheshire Oaks, having purchased the car from there I am always happy to return as the staff are always happy to help. Having arrived I met with Colin from the Service team advising that I would be bringing my car in as the MOT was due and requesting that a member from the car servicing team had a quick look to see if there was anything I could do in preparation to ensure the car passed. Colin arranged for a member of the service team (unfortunately his name escapes me) to have a detailed look over my car, from this I was provided with a couple of things that would need to be replaced prior to MOT but I was also advised of requirments I would need to consider to maintain my safety as a driver. Colin made the MOT booking on my behalf ensuring that it was fitted into my schedual, A handy reminder was sent out the day before. Due to the kindness of the staff my car passed it's MOT and was returned to me valeted. Colin kept me informed of my cars throughout. Many Thanks Audi"
10/3/16,5,"Before going on holiday we asked HA Fox Guildford to find us an FX to replace the Rover 75 connoisseur V6 that we had owned for 14 years.
It was a tall order, but Peter Leverton found one for us, and it ticked all our boxes.
There was absolutely no pressure to buy, a great deal was offered, and we are now the happy owners of our first FX Sportsbrake PR 3 ltr V6.
Thank you all the staff for your friendly efficient service."
10/3/16,5,"I received excellent customer service from Graham throughout the whole buying process. He was very friendly and informative and I am delighted with my new POLO.
I look forward to a long lasting relationship with Volkswagon Wirral. Highly recommended."
10/3/16,5,"As I had recently purchased a very up to date hi tech vw passatt estate I realised that I hated the auto hold and handbrake after 3 days I HAD to exchage it..After apologising ..my customer service was absolutely brilliant..especially Joe ,stewart'max,sally jen and mark..who made me feel that it was ok and they would do their best to find me something less high spec and a car that I would hopefully feel more confident in driving.All of this was done in a morning..with a smile and a lot of patience..I will always highly recommend vw chester branch..as they are top quality people .Thankyou."
10/3/16,5,"We booked our smart car in for its annual service at mercedes warrington. Arriving at 8am we quickly seen to by reception then Paul from the service department greeted us. The cars service was explained as was the MOT and then we were given our courtesy car. The courtesy car was a SLC convertible not a bad upgrade from a smart. We received a text before we were due to return at 3pm to collect the car saying it was ready. Upon return again the service and professionalism from Paul was excellent. Next time the smart is in for service he said we can choose what courtesy car we want.
Overall the service we receive at warrington is superb there is no waiting around and if there is then you can get a coffee and browse your next new car.
I chose a mercedes as my lease car and my wife chose the smart because of the service we receive
Well done all at warrington"
10/3/16,5,"My whole experience with Toyota has been an extremely pleasurable one. Corey has been friendly, efficient, helpful and polite. He is highly knowledgable with regards to the vehicles. His service was outstanding. I would highly recommend Toyota."
10/2/16,5,Excellent service at Mercedes Liverpool from initial visit and demonstration through to delivery of the vehicle. First rate product knowledge and genuine enthusiasm was abundantly clear. Nothing was too much trouble. We are very happy with the overall experience.
10/2/16,5,"Bought a used Polo from Inchcape VW in Swindon, and the service couldn't have been better if I'd been buying a brand new top of the range vehicle. A pleasure from start to finish."
10/2/16,1,Customer service very poor as well as having rude staff
10/2/16,5,"I have recently purchased a new VW Golf and the information about the vehicle and overall purchase were presented in a clear, professional manner. There was no pressure to purchase and I was kept informed of progress along the way. My previous car was also a Golf and it is helpful to receive videos identifying any problems and then follow up ones showing what has been done - inspires confidence."
10/1/16,5,"Tristan Jewett provided an excellent personal service, guiding me through model and finance options before i settled on a 420d Msport. My tight timescales did not phase him and he rose to every challenge to source an 'off the shelf' vehicle and the 11th hour registration of my personal number plate. Tristan was professionally supported by the Cooperbmw team at Cobham - nothing was too much trouble. Thoroughly recommended!"
10/1/16,4,"Good professional friendly service Graham very accommodating and kept us advised during the purchase period. Importantly car arrived before time and exactly as ordered.
One slight criticism surely a full tank of fuel is not too much to ask?

Otherwise very good"
9/30/16,5,"Had my 3+full service at H A Fox Jaguar Southampton this week. First visit and would highly recommend them. Customer service welcome, quality of workmanship and valet service all excellent.
TA IOW9"
9/30/16,5,"Having dealt with Inchcape Warrington and Chester and having visited Liverpool, I can say both my purchasing experiences at Chester have been excellent. All the staff are helpful, chatty, friendly, not at all pushy and put the customer at ease.
I was sold my latest vehicle by Grant Dodsworth at Chester and he met all the above criteria, his attitude then and his follow up calls and emails indicate that he cares about customers even after they've parted with their money."
9/30/16,5,"My car was collected by a pleasant driver, I received updates by text and e-mail, it had it's health check and M.O.T then was returned to me washed and vacuumed , what's not to like?!"
9/30/16,5,"Car booked in for a waiting service 8:30 am. Car ready !0:00 am within the time promised. Car returned totally clean, no over spill of oil etc and no marks inside. Justine excellent at her job and I would have no reservations in recommending this dealership."
9/30/16,5,"top score again
amazing service great team of girls and guys would and often have recommend Lexus Nottingham.
car went in for a check gave me the new RC 300 for a day.
then filmed my car and sent a link and to top it off filled my car of fuel.
thanks again."
9/30/16,4,"The service team scores 10/10. Very communicative, helpful and interactive with all software updates carried out on my new VW Passat Alltrack. However, the front reception desk is a bit of a shambles and communication between them and the service team could be much better managed from a customer perspective."
9/29/16,5,"I have used Cooper BMW Durham for over the last three years now and the service from every team there is superb!

I recently went to look at the offers BMW had on for the new 66 plates which I got updated by BMW's marketing email. After meeting Nigel Carr my experiences went to a whole new level with BMW. His excellent service in exchanging my old BMW to a new Series One was amazing he walked me through everything with fantastic communication in and out of BMW over the phone or email.

Nigel was a pleasure to deal with over the couple of weeks before picking up my new car with great banter and jokes. Even though I knew the Series One well he kept everything professional and walked me through the new Car, iDrive and Nav.

I would recommend Cooper Durham and Nigel to a friend if they were interested in getting a BMW for the very smooth and satisfying experience.

Thank you!"
9/29/16,5,Just collected my new Mini from Glen at Cooper Norwich. From the very first phone conversation to the Handover of the vehicle the Service we received from Glen was First class. Nothing was too much trouble and the minor issues we had with the vehicle were sorted without any fuss. It made the whole buying experience very pleasurable and we will definitely be back and recommend Cooper Norwich to others.
9/29/16,5,"Purchased a new VW Tiguan. Excellent customer service from start to finish provided by Matthew Walker nothing to much trouble.enabled me to buy a higher specification vehicle than expected.pleasurable experience

9/29/16,5,"My car went in for its first MOT, full service and to deal with the emissions problem.
I cannot fault the company. The whole process was explained clearly, I was kept in contact and informed of any possible problems and dealt with in a thoroughly professional manner.
My car has been returned clean and tidy and when driving it I can feel the improvement with the breaking system etc.
Will be returning."
9/28/16,5,"Always a pleasure to visit this dealership. From Receptionist to Sales Team, the staff are welcoming, engaging and very knowledgable, so much so, we have purchased 2 Minis in the last 2 months. Special thanks especially to Clare!"

Would recommend."

9/25/16,5,"The sales executive (Kerry H), did a fantastic job by going an extra mile to find a suitable car for me even though we were the last customers that evening. From signing the documents to unravelling the car at the end was a great moment to experience. I would certainly recommend this dealership to anyone."
9/24/16,5,"Excellent service from start to finish. We are so pleased with our new car it is even better than we had hoped for. Thank you Christina and Chris.

Regards Debbie and Richard"
9/23/16,5,I recently bought a Q5 from Audi Macclesfield and it was probably the best overall experience I have ever had buying a new car. I was really fortunate to have David Kynaston as my sales person and he made everything so easy. His whole approach was so professional and relaxing and would strongly recommend him to future customers. I will have no hesitation in going back to Macclesfield Audi in years to come.
9/23/16,5,Recently bought a vw polo Oldham did it's upmost to make sure I got the best price. The sales and service were excellent and the warranty and free insurance and just a bonus!

9/21/16,5,"Many thanks to Cheshire Oaks Audi in arranging my purchase of an A3. Special thanks to Jeff Markham for arranging everything. All of the staff are helpful and make your visit a comfortable one.
After originally thinking of down sizing to an A1 I made the decision to go for an A3 instead. A big thanks to Nigel Tyldesley for helping me decide.
The car was available when I wanted it to be and was presented perfectly. After years of driving Fords or similar I was surprised as to how good the A3 is.
I would recommend Cheshire Oaks Audi to all my family and friends."
9/21/16,5,"Bought my car from here 3 years ago. Great service. have had it serviced and MOT'd there since, even though it's not the nearest Audi garage to me. Also polite, helpful, courteous, do a good job and nothing is too much trouble. Can't ask for more than that. And they don't try and 'rip' you off with unnecessary work."
9/21/16,5,"From the moment I walked in to Audi, I was greeted with smiles & friendly faces. Everyone made me really feel welcome.
I received excellent service from start to finish. John McGiffin couldn’t do enough for me. He’s a great asset to the team."
9/21/16,5,"From initial enquiry to collecting the car, the knowledgeable staff at Inchcape were friendly, helpful and efficient. Excellent service overall."
9/20/16,5,"I originally walked into Macclesfield Audi to compare the sizes and shapes of their fleet. We had been thinking of getting a small run around, but nothing too series. After some time talking to Peter, who guided me through the various differences and choices and even took me on a test drive there and then, I decided to order an A1. I then had to go home and tell the family! Once I had taken them in to have a look they were as excited as I was, and we even decided to order a new larger family car too. Walked in with some questions, waked out with 2 new cars. I can honestly say at no point did I feel I was being sold to or pressured in any way. Peter had answers to all my questions and couldn't have been more pleasant to deal with. He kept me informed during the cars build and transport and made sure it was all set up before I left. Unfortunately the general manager is a Man Utd fan, but we can't have everything!

Thank you Macclesfield Audi. Can't wait for the next one to arrive."
9/20/16,5,"Got a puncture on arrival at test house in Leatherhead. Was able to drop off vehicle and Cooper BMW ordered replacement tyre and fitted, all done by 2pm. Cleaned and ready to collect when I finished my day of testing."
9/20/16,5,"I purchased my F-Type from HA Fox Southampton. They could not have been more helpful or accommodating of a demanding, ""knows her own mind"" client!
I had made a slight error in the configuration of the vehicle which Graham - by getting to know me - realised before the Dealer Fix suspected was not quite right and, by him knowing me, a potential disaster was avoided.
You don't get this attention to detail just anywhere.
Well done, guys and gals."
9/20/16,5,"VW Wirral located in Bromborough exceed expectations on every visit. Friendly staff, polite and professional who go the extra mile delivering outstanding customer service. I was kept informed of progress of my long life service by having a video sent to me to view with advisory recommendations from the technician working on my vehicle. When I come to collect the vehicle it had been valeted inside and out which was a stark contrast to how I gave the vehicle in for work to be carried out with being on the motorway network with salt on the road during winter. A big thanks to the team, who all do a fantastic job ensuring that a great experience for the customer is delivered."
9/20/16,5,"Picked up new AMG from Tim Irons at Derby, extremely attentive to my needs and great product knowledge. I have dealt with Derby for many years now and it is great to see the same faces who also of course know me well. Can't recommend enough."
9/19/16,5,"I had a call from Jamie, who was following up on my request for brochures. It was clear when I went in that he and his colleagues were keen for the business and worked hard to ensure a very smooth and satisfying transaction.

Definitely worth a visit - they will look after you well."
9/19/16,5,No problems with purchase
9/19/16,5,"The team at derby are professional and non pushy salesman, they allow you to browse at your leisure .
They always off great hospitality with drinks & biscuits .
It's just a pleasure in dealing with them.
Thanks guys.

Try the Lexus experience , it's fantastic"
9/19/16,4,"We have just bought our 2nd used Mercedes from the dealer in Kidlington and so far the service has been what you woud expect from the brand. No hassle, everything dealt with promptly and efficiently. Having had the car for 3 days we like it very much (E220 Estate). yesterday it displayed an error message about the auxillary battery so i contacted the dealer by email and received a call 5 minutes later! car booked in replacement car sorted so so far all is well. Thanks to Sarwar and the team for a professional approach."
9/19/16,5,Well done to Adele Osborne at the Bury branch of VW for going that extra mile while assisting with my service.
9/19/16,5,Fantastic customer service and loved the box of goodies I recieved.
9/19/16,5,"Just taken delivery of our second new Mini Cooper from this dealership. As always, excellent experience!

They listen to your ask, go out their way to put a package together to suit your needs and budget and more importantly for me, never put you through the big sales pitch! Kept in touch from ordering to delivery and beyond.

Highly recommend speaking to Becky, superb service throughout, huge thanks."
9/19/16,5,My car was ready on time and valeted too. David looked after me very well keeping me informed as to the progress of the work whilst being courteous and informative. I have used Bolton Audi since 2010 when I first begame an Audi driver and would recommend them to anyone.
9/19/16,5,Excellent service for an urgent refit of rear brakes and a service. Nice clean car too!
9/19/16,5,Received excellent service from Beth at Bolton Audi. Kept me fully informed of the process and any outstanding service requirements.
9/19/16,5,"Given I'd decided what car, model & features I wanted winning the business was really a question of service. Phil was superb throughout, attentive but not intrusive. No other deal (all main dealerships) came close to delivering the quality of service."
9/19/16,4,"Had my first service on my Auris Hybrid Excel last week , at Burton Inchcape Toyota , Pleasantly supprised at the new e/mail video of the inspection of the underbody brakes and tyres of the vehicle and also of the ticklist what had been checked and the wash and leather afterwards ! Well done all."
9/19/16,5,Ha Fox Jaguar York are absolutely fantastic and look after all of our requirements - if there are any issues (which there rarely are) I simply give them a call and they sort it out straight away. The servicing department is spot on and always make you feel like a valued customer so I cannot recommend them enough!!!
9/19/16,5,Kind and friendly and accommodating and make you feel at home.
9/19/16,5,I had my Polo seviced at Inchcape Bolton. The service team are very helpful and the first major service on the car has made a noticeable difference. The video feedback is useful and the car was handed back in pristine condition after a complimentary wash and vac. I would highly recommend this company.
9/19/16,5,An unexpected alert showed up on the MFD on a bank holiday Monday! Inchcape Exeter were helpful and efficient in explaining the reason and include a software update to the air conditioning system while the vehicle was in their service department. Many thanks to Aaron and all of the service technicians!
9/19/16,5,"Have been having my Yaris serviced at Inchape Guildford since 2011. They have always been very efficient, courteous, accommodating. I would highly recommend their services."
9/19/16,5,"Just got the wife a Countryman on a PCP deal. Really impressed with the sales/service at this dealership. James is a credit to the company and actually listened to what we wanted, got what we were after within the budget and whilst he of course had to mention the usual add-ons (paint cover, alloy wheel cover etc.) this was not hard sell and we bought the GPA cover and service plan because we wanted these. Would go back to this dealership without hesitation - most of all my wife loves her new car! Might just add that I am currently looking at a new company car and have recently spoken to both Jaguar and Mercedes and arranged test drives. So far, all they are focused on is getting me to buy because they have their targets to meet, neither have actually listened to what I have said - had they done so this might actually sway me (maybe I'm old fashioned because I'm in financial sales myself and if I did this to my clients they would go elsewhere). The mini dealership service exceeded these so-called premium brands."
9/19/16,5,"Gareth rang me to invite me to VW event with possibility of changing my Polo.
Gareth couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.
He gave me all the information and options I needed, arranged an instant test drive, and sorted out a lovely new Polo with just the spec I wanted.
Communication was great, and I literally drove the Polo out of the showroom.
Really happy all round :)"
9/18/16,5,"Looking for a new car, but confused with what to buy, my brother recommend copper Norwich, as he has purchased his last 4 cars from there. So off we went.....and I was so pleasantly surprised at the excellent customer service I received from start to finish from Nuala. She was faultless and very professional in her work, and she really added to my experience of purchasing my first bmw 1 series! Nuala made me feel at ease, and took a great deal of time with me, teaching me all about the gadgets and gizmos on the car. I would highly recommend cooper Norwich to anybody. They organised a taxi to collect me, so I could pick up my new car....on time! Gave me a lovely personal call the following day, just to check I was happy with my purchase. 10/10 would highly recommend!"
9/18/16,5,"Bought another new A5 convertible after the 3 years lease hire was up on the last one. I walked in on a Saturday, without a prior appointment and sat down with a nice cup of tea. I dealt with Andre, who worked through my options. He did a great job searching and explaining my options. I signed up for a similar car I already had but this time an automatic that I wanted and a limited special edition. Awesome!"
9/17/16,5,Purchased my car last week and received excellent customer service by Mark Edwards. He went out his way to ensure my car was the way I wanted it and kept me updated on the progress. Thank you
9/17/16,5,Arranged my first service and was treated just as well as when I bought the car 2 years ago
9/17/16,5,"Purchased new 66 plate GLA 220 premium plus. Big thanks to all staff at Chester for excellent service, with special thanks to Ross Miotti for a fab experience and smooth easy purchase. We were well looked after by the attentive, helpful team. (The coffee is great too!)
Many Thanks & Best Wishes"
9/17/16,5,Recently purchased a new Polo from Stockport. Being my first purchase of a new car It was a little daunting but Harry was great at explaining everything and had good product knowledge along with a non pushy salesman type attitude. The dealership is a sleek modern place making it a pleasure to wander around and look at the cars. A fantastic experience throughout.
9/16/16,5,"Had a great experience with the purchase of a new AMG,thanks to Andres Salcedo at Derby for his professionalism & knowledge & swift communication leading to a flawless handover,thanks....."
9/16/16,5,"Our Salesman Rod was very attentive & answered all our questions with honesty & integrity. Nothing was too much trouble, he bent over backwards to help. The car he sold us more than meets our needs which is great.. Many thanks for everything.."
9/16/16,5,"I have been with Toyota Nottingham since 2010. This year was the best ever experience! I even had the call a couple of days after taking the car....this is a first, all have said they would ring to ask how I was getting on with the car, but no one actually did it!"
9/16/16,5,"My experience with Lexus Derby started 2 years ago when I was thinking of renewing my 3 year old Prius. I bought a 1 year old CT200h Advantage. The reception and Customer service I have received since that day has been exceptionally good. However, my opinion of Lexus Derby has been enhanced as I have just completed buying a new CT200h F Sport model. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience from the day that Andrew Hardy thoroughly explained to me my full options and we sat together to make sure that I was buying a car that suited my needs without breaking the bank. I have always received the most courteous reception at Lexus Derby and cannot praise the whole team highly enough. Footnote: I liked the coffee they served so much that I have bought a Nespresso machine and the same grade of coffee. I am still practicing the Lexus logo in the froth.
Kind regards
Keith Smith"
9/16/16,5,"Excellent service - understood what I wanted and went out of her way to may sure I got the right deal, on the right car!

Would recommend the Dealership and Anna.

fyi - The parts manager (Rick) provided the extras I wanted REALLY quickly!"
9/16/16,5,"As a new customer I took my car to Altrincham for a service and was delighted with the experience. All the staff I met were extremely professional and most courteous. The car was serviced promptly and I was kept up to date of progress throughout the morning. Collection ran like clockwork and I left feeling confident that a good job had been done. A big thankyou to all concerned.
I wii be recommending the company to family and friends."
9/16/16,4,"Bought an A5 from Clive in Tetbury and had great service. The non-pushiness helped make the decision process very easy and the car (so far!) is brilliant. The odd after sale question has been dealt with well too.
Update: since buying the car I found a couple of issues that needed correcting. Agreeing to fix them wasn't a problem but it took several weeks of emails and chasing phone calls to get sorted which is not what I have experienced from Audi in the past. I have also received a phone call from their service dept only a couple of months after purchase telling me the breaks need servicing. Again I expect a 2 1/2 year old car to be roadworthy for at least a year when buying from an Audi dealer. Disappointing from what is otherwise a brilliant new car."
9/16/16,5,"My 320 was due it's first M.O.T and three year service. Car was collected from my house and returned at the said time which saved me a lot of aggravation. Everything was done with efficiency and professionalism and I was kept informed throughout, Car was cleaned before being returned. All in all very pleased with the service from Cooper BMW York."
9/15/16,5,"I recently purchased a used car from Cooper BMW Cobham, my experience was trouble free and all my demands were met without problem. The collection day was arranged and all paperwork and payment including the problem with banks blocking debit card were handled without fuss. Would definitely recommend this group to friends. Thanks to Jack Bristow at Cobham for making it easy to give this review."
9/15/16,5,"I took a recently-purchased second-hand vehicle with a couple of months left on the manufacturer warranty to the folks at Inchscape for the first time, at the recommendation of VW UK, to make sure I was registered on VW's system properly, see if there were any recalls, make sure I was on the right service schedule for my mileage etc.

Was absolutely gobsmacked by the quality of service I received. Despite not having purchased the vehicle through them or indeed another VW dealership, they treated me as if I'd bought the vehicle from them. Within half an hour the vehicle's details were registered to me, we had a service plan agreed, they confirmed the warranty was valid, and that there were some scheduled recalls...one of which they did there and then, along with a 24 point inspection.

And whilst I was sat drinking coffee, I got a text, and an email...from their service manager, with a link to a video upload of my inspection, indicating an immediate need issue (nail in tyre - good spot) which they fixed gratis, as I'd just taken out a service plan.

Half an hour more, one fixed car with an internal valet and a carwash.

Outstanding."
9/15/16,5,I could not fault the service I have received from Lexus from start to finish. I'm really pleased with my new car and would not hesitate to recommend Lexus to friends and family.
9/15/16,5,"Firstly on arriving at the showroom you are greeted by a friendly happy person on the reception desk. The sales person Paul understood exactly what I wanted to do in respect of changing my car and looked after me from first visit to new car handover.He returned calls and emails allmost immediately.
I would without hesitation recommend this Merc dealer to friends and family."
9/15/16,5,"I attended a promotional weekend about 6 weeks ago and had arranged to meet Dean Fletcher, sales executive, at Cooper Malton. Dean gave me clear sound advice re changing up to a 5 series. He quickly arranged a test drive and came up with a great deal. He kept me fully informed re the production, delivery and hand over of my new car. There were some issues with swapping my cherished registration number, DVLAs issues not Copper Malton, that Dean was able to sort out and get me into my new car just prior to a touring holiday to Scotland. The car and the service from start to finish has been outstanding."
9/15/16,5,"I was expecting the 'normal' type of main dealer service (had a 3 series BMW for 4 years) for my A3 first service.
Friendly greeting at reception, no queue, offered coffee etc.
I waited from 0800 to 1030 (my choice) in the waiting area, comfortable and wifi.
No BS about what might be wrong with it, just straightforward 'it's finished and ready to go and washed and cleaned'
An hour later I got a video of the Engineer checking my tyres and telling me what the tread depths were.
One step beyond, thank you to everyone at Audi Maidstone"
9/15/16,5,"From receiving an email to remind me the MOT was due to the service dept delivering the car back to my home the service and customer care was first class. I even received a video of the car health check showing where the tyre was worn! No complaints whatsoever, thankyou Cooper York"
9/15/16,5,"I purchased my very first brand new car from Inchcape, a brand new Beetle. Everyone was so friendly, being quite a nervous person and worried about driving my new car home for the first time, Tony Pearson kindly drove me home in my new car. He went through everything with me, he made me feel and reitterated many times that I could phone anytime to ask any questions. A brilliant service, lovely people who make you feel really special. Thank you Tony (Anthony) Pearson. When my daughter decides to purchase her Scirocco she will come and see you. I would recommend Inchcape to everyone know. Thank you so much, love my car. Debbie Kingham."
9/15/16,5,"I bought my X3 at Cooper BMW, Tunbridge Wells, and I have always received courteous, prompt and efficient service of an exemplary standard."
9/14/16,5,"Mercedes warrington were excellent, great help and service' got a brilliant deal too and a mr ben culpin who i dealt with is the man!!!"
9/14/16,5,"Just had my Golf GTI Cabriolet serviced at Inchcape VW Southend and was very pleased with the overall customer experience. I was promptly seen by the Service Advisor, Alex, who was friendly and very polite. The service was completed ahead of the time that I had requested and the video inspection report was an interesting added feature."
9/13/16,5,"Looked for a Discovery sport in red, local Land Rover dealers where I live did not seem interested in finding me one.
Went on to Auto Trader and found 3 that were at different dealerships in the country with various responses from average to excellent. Derby in the form of Richard were more than interested in finding me the car I was looking for. All salesmen in the UK I spoke to were quite cool until I mentioned I would buy one by 5.30 that day. Richard came up trumps found the car and four days delivered it to my home taking the part exchange car away. Richard arranged the transfer of my personal Reg number. Gave him a few things to follow up and I have very confidence in him to do as promised. Richards attitude to customer service was spot on.
Pity local dealers were not so responsive I purchased from 80 miles from my home. Derby LandRover you have got it right"
9/13/16,1,"I have purchased six or seven vehicles from this company in the past. My Golf is one of the vehicles which is involved in the diesel emissions scandal. I phoned today to talk to someone at the dealership in Bolton regarding this matter. That disinterested couldn't even be bothered to come to the phone to talk. Pathetic customer service, just lost a long time customer."
9/12/16,5,Had a lovely pain free purchase last Friday when I took delivery of my new-to-me Up. The staff went out of their way to make me feel like it was a special day.
9/12/16,5,Just picked up my new VW Scirocco 2.0TDI. Excellent service - well done. The members of staff ensured buying my new vehicle was an enjoyable experience from start to finish.
9/12/16,5,Excellent service from Neil H and Lee at VE Cheltenham from start to finish. Provided clear solutions for my situation with options and created a finance deal to suit my needs. They were extremely professional but relaxed and personable with it. Would recommend a visit to anyone.
9/12/16,5,"I purchased a car recently and the service was excellent. Asher Feather kept me updated by phone, text or email and everything took place as discussed and agreed. Asher was great to deal with and I would recommend him to friends."
9/12/16,5,"Superb service from Tony & Daley!!!

On the 1st September I went to look at an SLC which had done 200 miles but when i arrived it was not clean and looked used so i bought a brand new one from the showroom with over £12k of options on it. Got it for a good price and collected on 7th Sept.

Communication was superb as i was kept informed of every step of the way. The car was ready on the day promised and with all the accessories i had requested.

I can honestly say this is the best service i have ever received from any dealership. I have been driving for over 30 years (i am 47) and have had a new car every year from brands as varied as Audi, BMW, Citroen, Jaguar, Mercedes, Volvo, Porsche, Renault, VW etc

Thanks so much for looking after me : )"
9/12/16,5,"In all our years of buying new cars, this has been the very best experience.Absolutely stress- free and a professional attitude to high quality service shown.Thanks to Stephen Mitchell every aspect from ordering to handover was smoothly done and made us feel valued.
Using Carwow saved us a great deal of money and did not detract from the service we received from Mercedes Liverpool.
We would not hesitate to use Carwow and Liverpool Mercedes again."
9/12/16,5,Top class service from start to finish. Regularly updated by our sales person. Friendly and professional throughout. Will definitely go back to them for my next car.
9/12/16,5,Brilliant. Aways been very wary of Main Dealers; especially after my experience with a Volvo dealer. This dealer is really good and I have nothing but good things to say about them.
9/12/16,5,"I have dealt with Tetbury Audi for the last six years now. Even though it may not have been the the same sales operative each time they have always been thoroughly pleasant, very professional and informative without being 'overpowering '.
Still have the Q7, A5 convertible and S1 that I purchased there. All are kindly collected for servicing and returned all nicely valeted.
Highly impressed with whichever member of the staff I have had the fortune to deal with over the last six years.
Well done guys and gals.

Kind regards Richard Pearson, Bristol."
9/12/16,1,"I have been dealing with the Manchester Trafford office recently, and have received service I feel is well below what would be expected of such a brand.

Having purchased a brand new VW Camper van in March this year have regrettably had to return it for warranty work 5 times, The warranty was honoured, but what I do find unacceptable is the following chain of events.
Whilst in the possession of Inchcape Manchester, the camper sustained impact damage to the passenger side rear panel, which is the largest panel on the van. I was called, informed of the damage and told it would take a little time to repair, I was vehement in my comments that I wanted know in advance, what work would be required. As you can imagine, major body work to a brand new vehicle could pose a challenge should I wish to sell the van at any point. I don’t think this was an unreasonable request. Apparently the message never got passed on (Comments echoed by other reviews) and I never received a call
I was not informed in advance, I was however called whilst the vehicle was on its return journey to myself. Due to the extremely short notice (it was already on its way!) I could not get out of work, and my wife had to take delivery of the vehicle.
Upon my return to home I noted there was still “sticky tape” along the roof as well as along one panel, the van was extremely dusty (I have to assume from work on this vehicle, or others within the workshop) and on top of other numerous issues, it was completely out of fuel!?
I felt I had no other option than to cascade my frustrations to my contact, and the manager at Trafford, I was absolutely flabbergasted when he told me that all the work had been done “As a goodwill gesture”, I should be grateful and that they were under NO OBLIGATION TO STAND RESPONSBILE FOR ANY DAMAGE whilst the vehicle was in their “care”.

I invite ANYONE to answer this:
If I take a vehicle from Inchcape, put it in a carpark and allow it to be damaged whilst in my possession, would they accept it back with absolutely no liability or repercussions?

After an upsetting phone call where I really had to suggest how I feel these failings could be corrected, it has finally been suggested, a valet to the Camper van, and replacement of fuel used, I am however extremely anxious and apprehensive about handing over my VW again, with their track record, there is a good chance it may be damaged, Inchcape take absolutely zero responsibility for any damage whilst they have it!?

I will update further after a resolution, I just wanted to pre warn any other customers handing over their brand new vehicles !"
9/12/16,5,"Dealt with Sam Perkins who was v professional , helpful & straight foward (no over selling !)
My wife loves the car & I would definitely recommend Inchcape VW

Gavin MacEchern"
9/12/16,5,Excellent service. Extremely satisfied with all aspects of my experience.
9/12/16,5,"Myself and my husband went to see Cooper Mini with a view to purchasing a new mini. We found the whole experience comfortable, easy and easily explained. The Executive who looked after us Jon Taylor was very knowledgeable, easy to talk to and explained everything in easy to understand stages. Would recommend the company and Jon without hesitation."
9/11/16,5,"I'm on my 5th mini with Cooper Malton mini now, for one simple reason; they have given me unparalleled service every single time. My most recent purchase (a surprise birthday present for my wife) involved a huge amount of secrecy by everyone at the dealership, and they 'played a blinder'. They are helpful, friendly, efficient and really do seem to care about making sure everything is right, rather than just trying to sell you a car. I would have no hesitation in recommending this dealership to anyone wanting a new mini."
9/10/16,5,Good service that is done with minimum of fuss and inconvenience to the customer
9/10/16,5,"Purchased the above vehicle last week, we were delighted with the service given by Eva. The original quote for three year finance with a balloon payment was not for us so Joe gave us another deal for a cash sale. Excellent customer service."
9/9/16,5,Fantastic service and staff who always go that extra mile for the customers well done Bolton
9/9/16,5,Great Service. Definitely use again.
9/9/16,5,"As I drove from Hampshire to my Sister's house in Hampton, my tyre pressure warning light came on. I went straight to the VW showroom at fulwell and they said they would take a look.
They found a huge nail embedded in the tyre and repaired it whilst I waited with a cup of coffee!
My car is still under warranty, but I thought I might have to pay something. Nope. They said that one was on them!
Lovely staff, so helpful (and with a smile), everyone I spoke with were brilliant.
My Sister usually drives to me and has her service in Hampshire (equally nice people at White Rose in Petersfield), but I have recommended she goes to Inchcape at Fulwell instead in the future!
Thank you!
Sue McLearie 😊"
9/9/16,5,"Thoughtful, welcoming, organised staff who go to all boundaries to make you happy."
9/8/16,5,Collected my discovery sport last week. Excellent service from first contact to handover. i am sure it will continue all along. great job. will recommend to friends!!
9/8/16,5,"I received the standard VW letter offering to update the car's software following the VW emissions scandal. I phone to book a time / date / home pickup and this was all agreed very efficiently. On the day, everything went smoothly: car picked up and returned exactly as pre-agreed by a friendly and professional member of Inchcape. I had also asked for an aircon check to be done at my expense - this was done but the charge (about £20) was waived. So overall, based on this experience, I was extremely pleased with Inchcape."
9/8/16,5,"Phil Bounds my salesman was excellent in both dealing and finding the best deals for me. He was quick with the responses and friendly, i did not feel scared to message him like i had done with over car dealerships. I was extremely happy with my car and he even showed me the controls before i set of in my new 66 plate! Phil gave me the best customer service i could ask for, especially when i couldn't make up my mind on what colour car i wanted so he showed me the different colours and talked to me about them. Overall i had a wonderful experience with Swindon Audi and i will be returning in 3 years for another new Audi!
Big thanks to Phil!"
9/8/16,5,"Superb service from booking straight through to completion of work required and beyond. Staff were friendly, professional and appreciative of the business. In addition the staff went above and beyond my expectations by contacting me following my appointment with a video analysis, email and courtesy call. I highly recommend inchcape Cheltenham for your VW service and I will be a repeat customer for sure."
9/8/16,5,"Macclesfield Audi is outstanding! Having visited several other Audi dealerships in the North West, Macclesfield Audi significantly outperforms them all.
Nothing is too much trouble & their focus is solely on customer satisfaction achieved by a very skilled and dedicated team.
Special thanks must go to Adrian Lynam who has managed my most recent requirements & should be highly commended.
Fabulous template for other garages to follow!!"
9/8/16,5,"After having my beloved 'Minnie the Minx' for 6 years, decided to part ex her recently and, as hard as it was, have now got - Minnie the Minx the 2nd!
David Skeen has to be the nicest person ever to deal with. He has been so patient and kind and understanding, not pushy at all and he is a real asset to Cooper Teesside.
All the staff there are great - Vince who meets and greets customers, whatever the weather! Debbie and Eve on reception are always friendly and helpful."
9/8/16,5,"I live 400 miles away and was looking for an approved used Audi, Dan from Tetbury was recommended, and he quickly got work looking for sending me Audi's that matched my budget and spec. Once I chose one, Dan worked hard to make sure it was everything I wanted and kept me in the loop throughout the process. When I came down to collect the car, the service was superb from start to finish and I will deffo be buying my next Audi from the team. Cheers all"
9/8/16,5,"Adam from Tunbridge Wells Audi as always provided a superb customer experience. Prompt , courteous and always keeping me up to date with news on MOT, Service, NOx software update and parts requirement.

The video of my car in the workshop sent by Ian, with explanation of what was found during the service is a really first class use of modern technology.

Thanks Adam and Ian"

Chris from service jumped in quick as a flash to save the day and prevent me from spitting my dummy out....
Sorted almost immediately and nothing too much trouble
This is my second A7 and Chris was always on the ball with sorting service and routine maintenance.
Great customer service all round at this dealership"
9/7/16,5,"This is my eighth Mercedes so I know what to expect of the brand. Gary Booth at Mercedes Nottingham made this a very smooth and enjoyable transaction, and I would not hesitate to recommend him to my friends and family. I will be looking to purchase a new Mercedes for my partner shortly, and Gary will be my first point of contact.#"
9/7/16,5,"Had a dealing with Stephen Pike who was a sales director and it was smooth and hassle free shopping . Great experience which you not really associate with car buying !! . Will recommend to friends & family
Regards
Harinder Singh"
9/7/16,5,Very rapid and professional service from Alex. No problems at all and I would recommend the dealership highly.
9/7/16,5,"Great service, knowledgeable service staff and no messing about in keeping me waiting either when dropping off the car or collecting at the end of the service.

I drive from Solihull to deal with MB Coventry, because the team is so good.

Andrew Landell"
9/7/16,5,Dealt with Dave Kynaston at Macclesfield Audi. Excellent service. Would be happy to deal with him again.
9/7/16,5,"I have been dealing with Matt at Inchcape Audi for years now, mainly for servicing and MOT (and lately for recalls) and have always been treated impeccably from the moment of booking to the finished job.
Matt has always been courteous and well informed, and the technicians (this time Tom) are clear and concise on the state of the car and jobs needing done. The Audicam feature is great and easy to follow.
Thanks Audi, you're worth being faithful to.
Mrs B, Maidstone"
9/6/16,5,Having had good experiences with service and warranty repairs for our previous Audi (bought elsewhere) we chose to order our current Audi here. The team made the whole process from initial order through to collection last week a pleasant one.
9/6/16,5,Can be difficult to access senior management however I found Chris Dobson both knowledgable and helpful in fact nothing is too much effort. I have bought 3 bikes from him and one of these had problems which is now sorted as I sit in the Dales after an awesome days biking
9/6/16,5,Southend dealer took in for 2 yr service on a sat morn in at 9:30 ready to collect at 12pm all done very informative on work done by a video link
9/6/16,4,"I recently purchased a car from Wirral Volkswagen. I has previously done research on price using CarWow. Once I test drove the car and came back they offered a price. However when I presented the CarWow price to them (which was significantly lower), it seemed as if we were causing them hassle because they had to reduce the price to the one that they had offered online making us feel very awkward.

Other than that everything else was great and the car is perfect."
9/6/16,5,I was very pleased with the deal offered by HA Fox which no other Jaguar dealer could match. The communication and service was excellent. I would definately recommend using HA Fox and I travelled a long way (150 miles) but it was well worth it for the saving and the customer service.
9/6/16,5,John at Colchester VW was extremely helpful and made it all an enjoyable and easy process of purchasing my new Polo!
9/5/16,5,I was looking for a TT & the Sales Executive Sam was most helpful. Sam searched the Audi database & found my ideal car. I felt as though I was buying a superior mark on every visit to to the showroom & by how I was treated by the staff.
9/5/16,5,"From speaking to our salesperson Henry to receiving our keys went very well, kept us informed every step of the way."
9/5/16,5,"I have just bought a new A1 at Macclesfield Audi & have been really impressed throughout. Neil has been super efficient, pleasant to deal with and kept me fully up to date during the process. I'm delighted with my new car which is just what I wanted & needed. Would definitely recommend"
9/5/16,5,I purchased a new 1 Series and dealt with Adam Basheer and Adam Shelton. Nothing was too much trouble: from choosing the right model for me then keeping me informed at every stage to the actual handover and lesson on the technology. A real pleasure to deal with them and a great credit to BMW.
9/5/16,5,We recently bought a used A1 from Bolton Audi and were treated very well from start to finish. The process was very smooth with no hard sell and we were offered the right value for our part exchange. The car was ready when agreed and we were helped throughout.
9/5/16,5,This company from our initial enquiry to purchasing our vehicle and subsequently our first service has been first class. They always keep you fully updated and are a breath of fresh air in this current unhelpful climate. Zoe organised my service and was friendly and efficient.
9/5/16,5,"We have dealt with Audi Cheshire Oaks now for approximately five years predominately with regards to servicing and MOT. Recently we have purchased a Q5 following a service visit for our previous car an A3.

Having a natural scepticism of sales staff we eventually was introduced to Henry Hughes a young and well mannered young man. Henry has an honest and diligent approach which compliments his knowledge and technical competency with the range of Audi vehicles.

We initially had a test drive and then left our decision for a week to further shop around and ensure we were going to get the best possible deal for our needs. On reaching our decision we had no hesitation in recontacting Henry and continuing with the sales process.

He made us feel relevant and more importantly went that extra mile to accommodate our needs as we eventually part exchanged 2 cars to purchase the Q5.

Well done Henry and keep up your excellent approach with customers."
9/5/16,5,"The service I received was excellent. I visited the showroom several times and was made to feel at ease. The process of buying the car was smooth and I felt that the team were interested in getting me the right car for me.

Overall , happy wit the service and especially happy with the car."
9/5/16,5,"All team members very helpful and didn't make me feel as if I had to rush into buying a car.
Helpful and polite.
Very pleas with my purchase no doubt."
9/5/16,5,Excellent service from Dave from start to finish.
9/5/16,5,"We would like to thank to Stewart Lane for such an amazing car buying experience! He did an fantastic job! He was very professional and knowledgeable. The whole process was very smooth and quick!
Excellent customer service, always willing to go the extra mile. Very pleasant experience. We will recommend Stewart to anyone i know wanting to buy a car.
We both love our new E-class.
We will be back!"
9/5/16,5,From start to finish this was a hassle free experience. Communication was good and staff were very helpful.
9/5/16,5,"I've been a customer here for over 10 years now and that is entirely because of the outstanding customer service and workmanship from the service team.

They always carry out the work in a timely manner, keep me updated and are so polite and genuinely welcoming."
9/4/16,5,"From start to finish a great service and unfaultable customer service skills....nothing was too much trouble for Rob, even to pick us up from the train station to collect our car.
All in all a great experience I'd deafantly recomend Crawley Audi to anyone, not to mention being the cheapest deal nationally, thanks again."
9/4/16,5,Purchase was very easy. Lee McSween couldn't have been more helpful. VW up going well so far.
9/4/16,3,"Not the best, service level below what is expected and what it has been previously. Reception appeared to be understaffed and arriving at 1.40 pm for a service at 2m I got the impression I was interrupting lunch break and should have waited until 2pm to report. Not what I have been used to."
9/4/16,5,"Every time we visit, we are dealt with courteously and professionally"
9/4/16,5,Excellent service very helpful and friendly. Thanks to Chris Kilworth
9/4/16,5,"I have just bought a new car and from the outset, I have been treated with courtesy and accuracy in all our negotiations. A recent problem was sorted out with no quibbles and I shall continue to use H A Fox for all my servicing needs."
9/3/16,5,"Excellent price for an A1, given Audi dealership, but the customer service at Macclesfield was exceptional. Additional extras were an added bonus and David King, the sales executive, was a pleasure to deal with. All together the best experience I have had buying a nearly new car, and would recommend to anyone."
9/2/16,5,I have been to Audi Stockport 3 times in the past 2 years to buy a car and left because of the awful attitude of the sales reps! This time I spoke to a sales rep called Jess and she was amazing and helpful! Not pushy and was there when we needed help not just to pester us into buying a car. We bought a A3 saloon from her. For me if you go to Audi Stockport and ask for Jess!
9/2/16,5,From the moment I entered the showroom the level of service was outstanding. I was provided with honest and accurate information and there was no pressure for me to make a purchase. Because of the highly professional level of customer care my purchase was easy and pleasant throughout-a seamless transaction. Having taken charge of my new car I was surprised at the level of after-care service I was offered. I cannot recommend this company highly enough. Elaine Small who dealt with me was superb. Many thanks indeed.
9/2/16,5,"Such a great experience with Audi Tunbridge Wells. So helpful and so friendly. It's been the best experience I've had with financing a new car. From the first time I walked into the show room to picking up the car, the customer service I've received has been incredible."
9/2/16,5,I was very impressed by the attentive sales process which was consistent with a prestige brand. The salesman knew his product very well and was happy to spend the time needed and was not pushy. Fabulous car too!
9/2/16,5,We went to Inchcape Stockport to look into buying 2 new cars. We were there for a good 5 hours and felt completely at ease. Martin our sales person couldn't have done anymore for us and nothing was too much trouble for him. We test drove a few cars on the day but never felt under any pressure to buy and went back the next day to purchase. The showroom itself is amazing too! Highly recommended!
9/2/16,5,"I've used Inchcape Toyota since moving to Nottingham about a year ago. The staff are always friendly, there's a comfy space for you to sit whilst you wait for your car to be dealt with, and complementary coffee/tea while you wait. Great service on my car too - and fairly priced."
9/2/16,4,Had the usual very good service here on Saturday. Provided with courtesy car. Nothing too much trouble for Helen in service team. Car returned on schedule with no queries from me and price previously agreed
9/1/16,5,All staff made me very welcome. The sales executive treated me as a customer and not a sales target
9/1/16,5,We went to coopers BMW in Malton and they couldn't of being more friendly. We asked for a certain car and within a week they had found us a few to choose from. Very quick service. With under a month we had the perfect car and all sorted. Didn't feel pushed into anything. Eddie who delt with us was so professional and lovely. Would deffo recommend and will be going back for other cars in the future. A* thank you so much
9/1/16,4,"All the staff were professional , courteous and knowledgeable .
The dealership websit however had a mind of its own , and was a real turnoff. Not what one expects or wants when trying to navigate through the complexities of buying a new car!"
9/1/16,5,"We bought our new Golf from Inchcape Chelmsford a year ago and received a fantastic thoroughly professional service from Shaun from start to finish.As part of the deal we took out a 2 year service deal.
Turning to the service, very easily booked, and reminder both by text and telephone, just in case 😀. I arrived early for the 8.30 service and was greeted at the reception where I gave my details and was offered a drink whilst waiting for a member of the team to come and see me.
Laura Taylor dealt with my servicing , and clearly explained the approx time it would take as I was waiting. There was a software update to be carried out which took longer than expected however Laura updated me several times with the progress.
I was not only impressed by the overall customer care, but also by the technician carrying out the service, no greasy prints over the paintwork door trim seats etc or oil dripping underneath when removing the filter or sump plug ( no messy driveway) although only simple things to me it makes a difference and proves they take pride in their work
My personal experience of Inchcape Chelmsford and their team has been excellent and I would definitely reccomend them for both sales and servicing."
9/1/16,4,Visited audi bolton on a sunday looking for replacement car having bought my last from there 12 years ago. Elaine Marsden was my sales executive. She was very knowledgable and helpful offering to move cars for me to testdrive. On deciding which car i wanted the negotiations were good and an amicable price was reached. I would certainly recommend the garage
9/1/16,5,"Great service, great people.. Thank you."
9/1/16,5,"Fantastic service supplied from the parts department, item ready to be picked up the very next day. Could not have asked for a more friendly staff member.
Gary"
9/1/16,5,"Oliver couldn't have been more helpful taking me through the purchase of my Toyota, with all the paperwork and explaining the various controls on the car."
9/1/16,5,"Everyone wants a good car and value for their money. My experience on every visit was well managed and tailored to meet my requirements. My reason to buy it from Cooper was piece of mind as they are over looked by BMW. Their staff is very helpful and educated.

Thanks!!"
9/1/16,5,"Could not fault service - Louis was excellent, saw process through from beginning to end.
Have had odd problem in past but this time, could not fault anything."
9/1/16,4,"I'll keep it brief. Since I bought my BMW, my experience of the Cooper BMW team at York is outstanding. Really great professional treatment and courtesy at every turn and technically I feel confident that my vehicle is in great hands.

[There's always room for improvement but this doesn't lie with Cooper BMW York but with the BMW Connected Drive team who in my opinion need to make themselves available and 'connect' with their customers. My experience with this team has been truly testing for me and not in a good way.]

If the Connected Drive guys had shown me the same professionalism I would have given 5 stars and not 4."
9/1/16,5,"Everything, from seeing the car to test drive it and purchase it was spotless. The guys at Audi Macclesfield made the experience of buying a car a great one. Most probable I'll use them again in the future."
9/1/16,5,"My wife and I drove from our Scarborough home to York, to look at a number of vehicles at different venues in the city. Size of vehicle was everything to our choice, and I knew that the BMW series 1 vehicles met the ticket!
We were looking for a nearly new vehicle, and there were a number of suitable candidates on the forecourt. After finding a vehicle we liked, we spoke with an excellent ambassador for Cooper York, Daniel Gibson, who arranged a test drive. After a lengthy and much appreciated drive, we decided we would like to purchase the vehicle.
Daniel made sure we were suitably supplied with coffee throughout our business, and made us feel completely at ease with the whole purchase process. Nothing was too much trouble in maximising our purchasing experience. Thanks to Daniel and his hard work, we were able to pick up the vehicle within two days!
As an aside, the garage was in immaculate condition - as were the toilets, and the sales team were all smartly dressed.
Buying our BMW 118 was Truly a wonderful experience."
9/1/16,5,I've bought a car and had it checked by them. Very professional service and communication. Can't fault anybody..
8/31/16,5,"Absolutely fantastic service, I'm from Manchester and saw the car I wanted at Inchcape Nottingham so I was a little concerned about the distance and getting everything organised, but Sonny Bhaker was brilliant! No hassle, everything taken care of, looked after all the details and got me a fabulous deal on the car I wanted. Picked up the car yesterday, I'm a very happy customer, I would definitely recommend Sonny and Inchcape. Thank you very much!"
8/31/16,5,"We have been customers of Audi Tetbury for many years and have always been extremely satisfied with all aspects of Audi.
We are always treated really well with a friendly but very professional approach. Customer service is second to none and I always feel like I have been treated as someone special on every visit
I picked ou my new A3 last Saturday and it was such an amazing experience. May I take this opportunity to mention Adam Corey who looked after me so well during the whole process. He was brilliant, very friendly and caring but with a very professional attitude. I feel that Audi always go the extra mile to look after all customers. Thank you Audi"
8/30/16,5,"From the moment I made contact with inchcape vw , I had a prompt email from Jessica wood in sales . I was requesting certain model with specific specification .
Within just a few hours Jessica had found me a vehicle , colour, specification and a range of finance options .
With some helpful direction Jessica had found me a package to suit our business requirements and I was more than happy to place an order .
We have a number of commercial vehicles but was impressed with the service , knowlage and all round advise i received .
I would not hesitate to purchase a vehicle from this company in the future and would make Jessica my first point of contact
Best regards
Dave Sharrock"
8/30/16,5,"Excellent service yet again. Anthony McCusker was informed, thorough and clear. I cannot recommend Swindon Audi highly enough."
8/30/16,5,"Having been looking for quite a few weeks for a new car and traveling lots of miles looking at various cars ,only for some sales men to look at me as if to say you can't afford one .i was very very please to come across the car that cooper Mallon had in .Ted the salesman was fantastic he went the extra miles to sell me a car .i wasn't judged when I walked in .me ,my wife,our twin 3 year old girls and a 10year old were made welcome and the girls were given books to colour in to keep the occupied .something that never happened befor .this garage is a credit to BMW and I will recommend them to anyone because the service is impeccable .i have had various calls of them asking if everything is ok .which it is the car is spot on .you will be hard to find a service better than you will get here"
8/30/16,5,"I came across this company as I broke down on the Hogs back, and they have been excellent ever since, from the front of the building to the back, i.e. the sales to the servicing, they are great, personable, easy going, responsive, helpful, they always try to help whatever the curcumstances.
I now travel 40 miles to use their services, which says something as I have a Landrover garage around the corner from where I live.
Use them they can't be bettered.

Nick"
8/30/16,5,"I was instantly impressed by the level of service I received from the moment I walked in to the inchcape Stockport Volkswagen branch. I was instantly greeted by the reception staff and was seen to by a sales representative with 2/3 minutes of entering.

I didn't have anything in particular in mind that I was looking for specifically, just a monthly budget. This is where the expert advice of the salesmen Robert Jutzrenka who was dealing with me and my partner came in to play.

I told him my situation and what I could afford and he quickly put together a few options for me. He had great advice about them all and could answer anything that I threw at him.

In the end I decided on a brand new GT edition golf. He helped me with part exchanging my previous car for this. Nothing was too much for him to do, and he is a massive influence on why I chose this specific car & dealership after looking at a few different close competetors.

From placing the order, waiting for the car to be shipped from Germany to collection of my new car I was kept well up to date with factual information, phone calls and even exciting personal videos just for me and my new car.

I couldn't thank Robert enough and I will be sure to point other new car or even used car buyers in his direction in an instance.

For many people, buying a new car can be slightly daunting and nervy, however I felt at ease throughout every step of the process.

It was a pleasure to deal with him and I will be defiantly going back there. Smiley faces all around."
8/30/16,5,"At Inchcape Colchester, I had great service from Alex. I arrived, apprehensive as I didn't know what I wanted and was worried about 'pushy' car salesmen, and was referred to Alex. He patiently went over lots of options with me, answered numerous questions and was even able to take me out for a test drive then and there! I left feeling far more confident about my choices and relieved that I hadn't been pressured into a deal. A couple of days later, I had made my decision to purchase a Golf and returned to see Alex again. He sorted out all the paperwork quickly and efficiently and made sure I was totally clear on and happy with all aspects of the deal I was making. Alex kept me informed on the progress of my new car and, once it was ready, finalized the paperwork and even showed me how to work all the gadgets and gizmos! I can't speak highly enough of Alex and the great service I had at Inchcape Colchester."
8/29/16,5,"Bought my car from Tunbridge wells Audi, Shane was very helpful and found me the perfect car. Couldn't be happier!"
8/29/16,5,"We walked in on a weekend to look for our first car. We visited a few dealers before Inchcape Bolton and our visit here made a big difference in our decision to buy. We didn't have to wait long to be seen and we were well informed about the car by the time we left.

Our salesman, Kyle H., was direct to the point and answered all our questions straight away. We didn't get hassled for buying straight away but definitely spoke our language with what we want to know and what our budget was. We bought the car and made a down payment on the same visit.

Succeeding visits to finalise the sale has been good. We were given the information we needed and a great deal on a new car."
8/29/16,5,"Jonathan Meigh handled my car replacement excellently. The experience would have been even better if:
1.There was an Audi system to automatically tell you, at each stage, where the new car was, like other retailers..eg. Currys, delivery companies etc.
2. The available loan cars could be displayed and booked online at Audi Macc.
3. Anyone ever acknowledged or contacted me after taking the time to provide this feedback."
8/29/16,5,"Picked up my new A3 and can't thank Blake enough for his help in choosing, ordering and purchasing my car. Everyone at Cheshire Oaks couldn't be more helpful. Would buy from them again."
8/29/16,5,"Maidstone Audi recently had my A3 in for a major service and MOT. They rang me a couple of weeks before they were due to book me in and also offered a loan car. It was on my to do list to arrange but great they took the initiative.

I was expected when I arrived and Matthew quickly booked the car in, confirmed the works and showed me to the loan car.

As promised in the afternoon I received an email with links to a video of the technician running through the advisory works that would need doing in the near future.

I collected the car at the agreed time and again Matthew dealt with me in a very friendly but professional manner.

The car had been cleaned inside and out. I did feel guilty about the dog hair on the back seat I had been meaning to clean out for some time!"
8/29/16,5,"Staff were very helpful and welcoming. Made a booking for recall work at very short notice as visiting the locality for a few days, the request was efficiently dealt with. Provided with transport to and from town centre. Reminders by phone and email in advance of visit. Coffee in comfortable waiting area. Free car valet. Sent video of safety inspection defects (worn tyres) which were replaced immediately on request. I would go out of my way to use this service again and will certainly consider them when purchasing next car."
8/28/16,5,"Great welcome despite my being half an hour early, all the Service people were fantastic and During the day I received regular updates via email and text and by phone when a parts order required my approval.

100%"
8/28/16,5,"Recently had my A5 in for service and an A3 in for tyres at Swindon Audi. Both times greeted with coffee and cakes, told what was about to happen and the costs involved and a car provided. A video was sent to identify any extra faults and at the time agreed both cars were ready. The tyre price was ultra competitive and the service was as expected. Both cars were fully valeted and ready to go. You could not get any better service than this and should be the standard all Audi dealers should get as currently they do not. Audi do need to monitor some dealers more closely. The only thing better than the service here at Swindon is the sales department which is exemplary especially Nigel Simpson who goes far beyond what a normal salesperson would be expected.
Overall a great experience and a credit to the management"
8/27/16,5,The high standard of service enjoyed at Nottingham Lexus continues to impress. Each time I visit there is yet another level reached. The latest is a video taken by your dedicated technician of the underside of the vehicle when he talks you through what we can't see. I found this both interesting and reassuring. Thank you to all the Nottingham staff.
8/27/16,4,"To be fair I have always taken my Audi to this centre in Swindon, as I have found them to be the best by a country mile in my area. However on this occasion I had to wait quite some time to be seen to by the service team. In fact, no not service team, service member, he was the only person working the department on a Saturday. Don't get me wrong the work was carried out with the same swift action and professionalism as always, I just think leaving someone waiting watching tv and reading out of date magazines on a Saturday, when all they have come in for is a interim service is a bit much. I wouldn't have minded but it wasn't even that busy. If I had of just turned up off the cuff I could understand but it was pre booked for quite sometime so the centre knew about my booking and my arrival. This being said, of course I would still return there as the work that is carried out in my experience has been second to none but to waist over half an hour before even being seen to was highly frustrating. In fairness I actually found it strange there was only one person working the department on a Saturday, normally there is at leather very minimum 2? I have only given 4 starts as work carried out expertly, they lost one star because of wait time. I didn't want to be that unfair and give them less. As normal once seen the member of staff was professional and courteous. However I did feel kind of rushed because of him being the only staff member he had to be quick with everyone he had seen so he could move on to the next customer. There wasn't the usual personal feel to this visit that is just normality at Swindon Audi."
8/27/16,5,"Very pleased with the purchase of my new polo, especially with the sales executive Rod Lane who was very helpful and guided us through the process and nothing was too much trouble for him."
8/27/16,5,"After looking at Porsche we drove past copper bmw in Colchester they had a really nice z4 outside so we went in, the sales team were very welcoming, extremely helpful and professional, I now own a lovely bmw z4 that I am thrilled with"
8/26/16,5,"I would like to thank to Simeon for such an amazing car buying experience! He did an amazing job! He was very professional, knowledgeable and caring. The whole process was very smooth and quick! I love my new A-class. Again, thank you!
I will recommend Simeon to anyone i know wanting to buy a car and i will definitely buy from him again."
8/26/16,5,"my first ""Audi"" experience has been faultless
I knew what car I wanted, all my questions were answered, differing finance options readily explored, no backwards and forwards trying to squeeze an extra £ - happy with my PX - test drove - 2 days later collected
Treated from the moment I entered the showroom with respect - I felt I mattered - I'm converted now - thanks guys"
8/26/16,5,"I was introduced to Hunters via an advert on auto trader. I called the dealership and was dealt with efficiently and with courtesy. The sales executive, Stephen Shortland, was extremely helpful and arranged a test drive for me. I subsequently purchased the car, and the process was professional and courteous throughout. They sent me a video on collection day showing my car looking all shiny and clean. The handover was extremely thorough and Stephen seemed genuinely happy for me. He called me the next day to check all was ok and to ensure I was happy. Overall, a very nice experience,I would certainly use hunters for my next purchase"
8/25/16,5,"Having recently purchased an A5 from Stockport Audi I would recommend them to anyone thinking of buying an Audi. All the staff were very courteous, professional and knowledgeable. Very nice people to deal with."
8/25/16,5,"My wife and I paid a visit to Hunters of Southampton see what cars they had in our price range and were pleasantly surprised by their range of stock of pre-owned vehicles. We found one that fitted our requirements. The sales staff were very helpful and the part exchange and purchase process was carried out painlessly accompanied by copious advice.
We can thoroughly recommend this dealership and we will be back in the future."
8/25/16,5,Friendly service no pressure would definitely would use again.
8/25/16,5,"Just had a major service done here on my VW EOS. Superb service, highly professional and great attention to detail. Pete the technician made a great video whilst carrying out the service and Andrew managed the whole process, keeping me informed and discussed options. Overall a really great job by this team. Car runs much, much better than before and I can't recommend them highly enough."
8/25/16,5,"Thanks to Mark for a professional sales experience, not pushy, very open, complimented the quality brand. The 5 Series is a cracking car too."
8/25/16,4,Over all a efficient and hassle free experience.
8/25/16,5,"I have been using Inchcape since 2004, and have nothing but praise for every aspect of dealing with them.

Highly recommended"
8/25/16,4,Good all round experience thank you
8/25/16,5,"Excellent customer service, always willing to go the extra mile. Very pleasant experience."
8/25/16,5,Booked my car in for a service on the online pilot and the car was collected first thing a few days later. Full service was completed in just a couple of hours and returned to me with no problems. They even through in a courtesy wash and internal hoover which would greatly appreciated. Everyone I spoke to directly and on the phone were very friendly and helpful. No complaints at all. Thank you for a wonderful service
8/25/16,5,"Excellent service, was kept informed all through the process, videos shown of inspection ! Courteous and friendly. Lots of people can sell you a shiny new car, but inch Cape Bolton after sales look after you just like a salesman. Having had lots of cars that isn't always the case, that is why I will always buy from inchcape sales and service excellent, many thanks."
8/25/16,5,"Visited Inchape to purchase my new Mercedes. Dealt with efficiently and courteously by Ian Macdonald.
Very pleased with my new purchase and the overall experience of dealing with Inchape."
8/24/16,5,"I have recently purchased a 2nd hand Golf with a FSO at Inchcape, Stockport so decided to go there when the service became due. I received first class service the whole way through, from booking the car in, delivering it in the morning, updates throughout the day right through to collecting it in the afternoon. 100% satisfied with all elements and will definitely return."
8/24/16,5,"I took my car in for service and found the staff polite and very informative . The car was serviced , I was informed by text , and I was able to pick the car up in very reasonable time ."
8/23/16,5,"Can't fault the service we received from start to finish and touchwood the car runs like a dream. Lee the salesman at twickenham was spot on and not the normal overbearing car salesman you generally meet, would happily recommend the dealership to family and friends

8/23/16,5,Excellent service and very friendly staff at Crawley Audi. Price is reasonable for a main dealer and don't feel ripped off or pressured. Provided with a brand new A4 as a courtesy car which was very nice. Would recommend and will continue to use myself.
8/23/16,5,Outstanding level of service from Chris Johnson in sales.
8/23/16,5,"Great service from start to finish, on line service film was vary good and very informative.
Good after service report , and follow up from Coopers.
Car returned on time and valeted throughout."
8/22/16,4,"Recently had my XF serviced which was collected and delivered back to me on the same day. Perfect.
However I did have to make a call to them on the day to confirm that they were still collecting my car and at what time. The pre service call never came as promised.
I also queried some serious corrosion to a rear suspension component which to me is a result of poor quality steel and coating. I was dis-appointed to be told that it would not be covered by the warranty and that I live to close to the sea. (2miles away) I have taken this up with Jaguar direct."
8/22/16,5,"Excellent customer experience during my first Mercedes service last Friday at Inchcape Liverpool. Well looked after, excellent attitude / professionalism of the staff I dealt with. Craig Williams was very helpful, he looked after my car service, and also sourced some additional information that I needed. My car was available for collection much earlier than expected, which was an added bonus, and was washed and vaccumed. Based on my experience, I would definitely recommend Inchcape Liverpool, and will most certainly return."
8/22/16,5,"Amazing service!!!!!

Friendly personal service with no hard sell sales tactics.

From the initial enquiry right through to picking up my new car, the staff kept me informed and took all of the worry of sorting out insurance etc away, they made the whole experience very special and painless."
8/22/16,5,Great showroom with friendly and helpful staff
8/22/16,5,"Extremely helpful with no pressure for a sale, would definitely recommend"
8/22/16,5,"This is my sixth Mercedes purchased from Mercedes Inchcape Liester and there will be another in a couple of years hopefully
The product speaks for itself but the customer service is second to none.
Can really say no more"
8/22/16,5,Loan car ready as requested. Lunchtime phone call to say all was well. Collected freshly washed and valeted and serviced car.
8/22/16,5,Bought my wife a used Z4 recently. Adam Shelton from the sales team took my call and I had a personalised video presentation of the car sent me within 30 minutes. My wife's car was delivered to us in Middlesbrough within 4 days. She is very happy with the car and I'm delighted with the customer care. Highly recommend Adam and the team CooperBMW. I've never bought a car without a test drive so I was a little anxious at first. My faith in the team was well placed!
8/22/16,5,"As I knew exactly which car I wanted, Inchcape Volkswagen Stockport were able to ensure I got the car as quickly as possible and at a very good deal. I would recommend friends and family to go there should they need a new car."
8/22/16,5,"Great service from start to finish. Booking in was easy with a 2 minute phone call, friendly reminder text the day before. Turned up to find everything was ready, dropped my car, off picked their car up went about my day, returned later that day to pick my car up was in and out within 5 minutes. Service from staff was 5* as they were all outgoing and helpful."
8/22/16,5,"I was late arriving but had phoned through to advise of my new arrival time.
I was met with a smiling face and confirmation that the Service would go ahead unaffected by my tardiness.
I was shown to the small comfortable Business area where I was able to set up my laptop and connect to the WiFi with ease and brought a hot cup of coffee and a biscuit.
After the promised 2 hours, the keys were returned to me with the car also having been washed. I finished what I was doing, put away my laptop etc had a few words with the Sales person and then said goodbye.

Just as you would wish it to be.

Perfect."
8/22/16,5,My car was collected for some recall work and returned later the same day. I was kept informed and the nature of the work explained to me. While at Coopers the car was given a free 'Health Check' and I received a video of the underside of the car while it was on ramps. I am grateful for the service I receive from Cooperbmw.
8/22/16,5,Very helpful staff and a great service
8/22/16,5,"We were looking for a really good Mini Cooper Automatic convertible with low mileage and not too old. In what seemed like no time at all Jade Harrison was on the case and emailed about 9 cars to think about. (In sharp contrast to this great service from Jade, I had also contacted another BMW Mini dealership who told me that they were hard to find and there weren't any!) Onwards ... we chose one car and let Jade know about this by email. At the of the day she sent me a message saying the car was still available so we committed to it. Everything else was plain sailing and Lee Fogg was equally helpful. Both really nice and helpful. I am looking at the car now in our drive - it's is absolutely immaculate. It's for my wife actually and she is over the moon about it. We are more than just impressed by Cooper Banstead and I wouldn't say this unless I meant it. I'm not easy to please. David Little."
8/22/16,5,"James King was very helpful and made buying this car very easy, would not hesitate going back.
Thank you"
8/22/16,5,"The whole experience of buying a new car with Mercedes Warrington was fantastic. The sales man I dealt with 'Daniel Nunn' was more than accommodating, he was knowledgeable about the vehicles and the whole process ran smoothly and I am more than happy with my new car. I would definitely buy from them again."
8/22/16,5,Had my car in for a Service and it was just a joy from making the appointment to picking the vehicle up. I was looked after by Nicola who really did a fantastic Job and looked after me. Highly recommend Mercedes Benz of Chester.
8/21/16,5,Always very helpful and professional .Michael the service manager is a pleasure to deal with . Well done on great service !
8/20/16,5,"Visited Chester for a test drive and bought a 2016 Golf Estate after the test drive.
After a disappointing experience at Inchcape Stockport where the staff member we met to discuss our needs seemed to be more in love with her iPad and appearance than with delivering a quality customer service, it was a revelation to go to Inchcape in Chester where both Jamie and Ben handled everything with assured professionalism and efficiency. Great service from start to finish at Inchcape in Chester."
8/20/16,5,Excellent and fully recommended service from David King and Macclesfield Audi.
8/20/16,5,"Great service, very friendly and knowledgeable.
Was attended to by Asher, who was very knowledgeable and explained all options and extras. No pressure selling, just straight forward efficient service."
8/20/16,5,"I would highly recommend Mercedes Benz of Warrington, they are an excellent company with very friendly and professional staff."
8/19/16,5,"Excellent salesperson. Helpful, patient and nothing was too much trouble. Would highly recommend this dealership. Ask for Paul!!"
8/19/16,5,I had inadvertently put screen wash in the coolant tank and needed to have it flushed out before the winter set in and the chance of damaging the engine. I booked with my local BMW service centre at Tunbridge Wells. Whilst waiting I was admiring the colour on a new BMW when Steve the salesman asked if I needed any help. I came out with my old car - just 17 months old - but having made arrangements to trade it in and purchase a lovely new one for 1st October. I call that 'taking the opportunity by the scruff of the neck'. Steve was not pushy and managed to secure a fantastic deal for me. Cannot wait until my new car arrives.
8/19/16,5,Fantastic all round service. Alex v helpful member of staff. Kept up 2 date with progress of my service. Work completed earlier than anticipated. Will definitely be back and would highly recommend
8/19/16,5,"Just purchased A3 from Cheshire Oaks Audi,superb service,highly recommended,many thanks to Chris and Kevin for their personal attention,a credit to the company that they represent."
8/19/16,5,I have just bought a TT from the Tetbury branch and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. All the staff were very helpful and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. I would definitely recommend them.
8/19/16,1,Cooperbmw unable to fix rattle in dashboard despite multiple attempts and I provided the link and instructions on how to
8/19/16,5,Been a regular user of Mercedes Benz Stratford and as always excellent service
8/18/16,5,"I cant fault Stockport Audi. Personable, courteous and professional staff with a reliable service, which is more affordable than you might expect. I took my car in last minute because I realised my MOT had expired whilst I'd been on holiday, no problem to them. The Service person I dealt with (Emma Kingston) went the extra mile, kept me updated with the schedule, and even got me a lift to the train station to get home after I'd dropped off my car. Highly recommended, unlike some main dealers/car manufactures I've dealt with...... nothing not to like, I'll be using them again."
8/18/16,3,"My second time of booking my car in here, but probably my last. Pleasant and efficient reception staff. Garage very efficient in confirming the booking once made but lack of attention to detail. Said at outset I needed an auto courtesy car, when booking the service some 4 weeks in advance, The call the night before the service had a manual booked. This needed to be sorted out when I took the car in the following morning so despite having a booked appt time, spent some 40 mins in showroom waiting for an auto to be found. Had a major service but some of the items ticked as done on the service sheet were not done. Car supposed to be cleaned and whilst admittedly cleaner than when it went in, looked as if it had been washed by someone who was in a rush......
Oh, and the service paper work showed the old reg no, the mot the new reg no. Shame that a lack of care has let them down. I doubt I will take my car there for a service again. I did give them the opportunity to discuss my experience and was not going to leave this feedback but no one bothered to contact me, so here is my view."
8/18/16,4,"Warm reception, Short while-waiting period, Unexpected visual check service. Overall good service. I will visit for my first annual service next year."
8/18/16,5,"I reported the air conditioning on my 2014 BMW 5 series was defective (a known and widespread problem with this model). Thames Ditton could not fit me in for two weeks plus but offered an appointment at Banstead the following day which I accepted.
I was dealt with by Nahidul who was polite, efficient and knowledgeable. I received an e mail with a short video clip of a visual health check of the car during the morning which was good and was kept updated on progress.
The issue was identified and a replacement condenser fitted under warranty. The car was returned having been valeted.
Things go wrong, even with premium brands. Whilst this is disappointing, good customer service, speedy resolution and no arguments over warranties go a long long way to maintaining customer confidence and loyalty. Thank you."
8/18/16,5,"Maidstone Inchape Audi provide exceptionally good servic everytime I visit, would not go to any other dealer. It's very rare now days to get such good customer service so keep it up Maidstone!"
8/18/16,5,"After weeks of searching locally for a vw CC I decided to take a risk and buy a used car over 250 miles away relying purely on the salesman's word and advertised details. Although this sounds crazy, I felt confident and assured from the perspective that I was buying from a VW approved used car dealership which came with the benefits of extensive pre-checks, 1 year's warranty, 30 day exchange benefits etc.

The gamble paid off as the entire end to end experience was excellent - Phil was attentive, patient and informative. I was sent a personalised video of the car which included a look inside too along with a full pdf spec. I basically bought a car online without having to leave my house and it was delivered the following day to my door! I love my new car and it is exactly as described, cannot fault it.

Will not hesitate to purchase from Inchcape telford again. :)"
8/18/16,5,Received regular updates throughout and even a text at the end with a video taking me through a summary of the MOT! BMW at its best
8/17/16,1,"Incompetent and dismal service after purchasing car.
On buying a virtually new car on 16th June 2016 ( it was about 1 year old with less than 5000 miles on the clock -it had been allocated to the head of sales) , I was informed that there everything was in perfect order but there was a problem with the Infotainment system, which would be ""simple to fix"" , following a short return to the showroom on a date to be pre-arranged. A new part was supposed to be ordered.
Ten days after collecting the vehicle I took it in following a call to me to say that I should go back for the new part. I did as requested but they did not have the right part.
I made several calls to the salesmen who had sold me the car but was never able to speak to either of them directly. Two weeks later after many unanswered messages I took the car in again. Again they did not have the right part. Two weeks later, the same problem. A week later it was allegedly sorted. The radio now worked. However, the card to run the SatNav was not in place. Finally on the 8th August I went in, unbooked and had a new Satnav card inserted into the infotainment computer.
To have a fully working car all took an unnecessary length of time. The sales department clearly never communicates with the service department, with phone messages either not passed on or ignored. It seems that once the salesmen have done their deal,and got their commission, they lose interest.
I have been driving VWs since 1973 but will not be buying another car from Inchcape ."
8/17/16,5,"Straightforward booking, SMS text reminder, service carried out and completed at the time promised.
I previously used this dealership 3 years ago. On using again the same excellent service is being delivered."
8/17/16,1,"Someone is posting what they want to write and this is not what I have published.

This is the worst car dealership I have used in the last 10 years."
8/16/16,5,Cooper BMW in Tadworth have been looking after my car for the past 8 years. Service is excellent. All staff very helpful. Graham Tozer on the service desk is outstanding and knowledgeable- always very helpful and offers useful informal advice.
8/16/16,4,"I recently had my 2-year-old VW Passat Estate serviced at VW Altrincham. The company were very efficient at providing a service reminder, offering a date/time which exactly met my needs, and managing the process on the day. The Service Team were very professional in their approach, and kept me informed at all stages, including sending me a short video of my vehicle's inspection.
My only gripe is the fact that the company was unable to price match a competitor for the supply & fitting of two new front tyres. It would have been much more convenient to get the tyres done as part of the service, but their best price was £7.50 per tyre more than the competitor, so I declined. I have bought tyres from another VW dealer in the past who were prepared to price-match the best competitor quote at the time. It's a shame this policy is not still in place."
8/16/16,5,"When looking for a pre-owned polo, I found two models I liked at Inchcape VW Swindon.Aaron(sales executive) arranged for both cars to be available for me to test.I found Aaron to be most helpful and patient, his product knowledge excellent .I would recommend Inchcape VW Swindon to any one."
8/16/16,5,first class service.
8/16/16,5,All personel we met or spoke to on the phone were friendly & polite at all times. We were never hounded or pressured at any time and no question was unanswered no matter how trivial. We will not hesitate to recommend them and we definitely go there again when looking for a car
8/15/16,5,"In July I took my Passat cc in for a service. Despite only covering 30k I was told that I needed 2 new shock absorbers. When they were done for some reason the headlights pointed straight into the ground something to do with self levelling lights. They took it back in and told me it was repaired but it was no better. Put it in again last week as also had a problem with the boot not locking and the left reversing light not working. Have been told that the problems are all interlinked? Head light problem resolved, boot problem resolved but now my rear reversing light is permanently on so it will mean another trip to the dealer. I have no complaints with the service staff, in fact they are very very good. They maybe need the workshop to get their act together. I know they will resolve this but it means me taking more time to go and get this resolved so not 100% happy with this dealers work."
8/15/16,5,I found the service provided by Inchcape to be first rate; their customer service was friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble for them. They arranged for a driver to take me home and brought the car back to me. I found the video showing the reason for the noise from the rear suspension very helpful. I would highly recommend Inchcape.
8/15/16,4,"great service and staff in both sales and service departments.

If there is one criticism its that they all seem to go to lunch at same time which can be a pain when trying to contact them at this time"
8/15/16,4,I have just bought a Q3 from Darren at Crawley Audi. He was so helpful & professional...... Would I buy another car off him? YES
8/15/16,5,I have been going to BMW Cooper Thames Ditton for 15 years and have always had excellent service from every department. Can highly recommend them.
8/15/16,5,"You ask for the truth. Amy Swingler is always welcoming, poite and an asset to Inchcape; but, she perhaps misinterprets what is said. i.e. ""Do you want the urgent work done on Thursday?"" My reply...""I have too many commitments"" was interpreted as being financial rather than time and noted on the invoice/worksheet as rejected due to cost. Not a serious matter by any means.
The visit was as painless as it could be and Inchcape, as always, take the burden [except cost :) ] from the customer. I used to be afraid of using main dealers, thinking that they would always find a way to make money from the customer. My experience so far has been that everything has been justified. Thank you."
8/15/16,5,"Very good and very easy to deal with.
Simon Baker was extremely thorough and professional without being too pushy. I would recommend this company and Simon to anyone.
On a personal note, thank you Simon from Peter and Sandy"
8/15/16,5,"I purchased a Hybrid. X5 I was treated very well, by all the friendly staff.
The Sales Executive Adam Blake was fantastic I cannot rate him more highly.
His product knowledge was excellent. Attention to detail excellent.
We are very pleased with our BMW purchase and extremely pleased with the X5 Hybrid. Thank you CooperBMW and Adam."
8/15/16,5,"I took my wife to pick up her new A3 Cabriolet on Friday, and whilst she absolutely loved the car, we were both extremely impressed by Thomas Jury, whose knowledge, professionalism, and caring manner shone through. As they say "" people buy from people"", and from the outset my dealings with Thomas were first class. Having been a Director in the service Industry for many years, the levels of service provided by Thomas and all at Maidstone were exemplary. Thank you"
8/15/16,3,"Look, the car aside, which was no problem, I objected to being drenched by the basin tap in the Gent's facility. I told two members of staff, received grudging acknowledgement but no one offered to help! Sat in a damp shirt all day.
Thanks Cooper Mini"
8/15/16,5,"Can't thank Kuz enough for helping me get my car, and getting it all sorted for me to pick up within a week. He helped me with everything he possibly could, and I love my car. Would definatly recommend to everybody I know. Very professional service and down to earth salesmen."
8/14/16,5,I was very happy with the way that I was dealt with by an excellent sales person names Dave Willis.
8/14/16,5,"Very attentive staff , helpful and friendly at all times. I have not had a new car for years and Amanda made it very special by videoing my new car the morning I was collecting all wrapped up in a bow, made me cry !! After care good too, little problems sorted out promptly."
8/14/16,5,"So happy with my new car, I got the aclass amg line, a girl named Zoe helped me out she was amazing and so helpful, very professional, if anyone is thinking of getting a car from there ask to speak to her ☺️"
8/13/16,5,"Picked up my brand new first Mercedes on Monday, I couldn't have asked for a better sales experience. The salesman Ben Culpin was fantastic, very knowledgeable about the full range, he listened to my requirements and was able to put together a deal that suited my budget. Just need to get to grips with all the gadgets and hopefully I won't have to bother Ben and the 24x7 support line too much."
8/13/16,5,"Since buying our Approved Used BMW in August we have had nothing but excellent after-sales service from the Sales Team, Service Reception and the Workshop staff.
A couple of minor problems were dealt with in a friendly and professional manner. The car was booked in at a time convenient to ourselves. We were kept informed on the work being done and the time it was likely to take. When handing the car back, the technician who had worked on it explained in detail what the problem had been and how it had been rectified.
The car was also given a full valet on each visit.
I would have no hesitation in recommending the team at Cooper Cobham BMW for all your Sales and Servicing needs."
8/12/16,5,"Was going to purchase a second hand car, but ended up with a new one due to the deal and quality of the current Golf Match Edition and being able to get exactly what I wanted. Guy was extremely helpful and the test drive really sold the car to me.
The quality of the car and the experience collecting the car with all the additional items was brilliant.
Would recommend anyone to go to VW Inchcape Chiswick for a wide range of cars and the service."
8/12/16,5,"I bought my convertible mini from CooperMini Croydon 6 years ago, had it serviced there and MOTs since they gave been due. Easy to book it in, excellent service and communication. Always left spotless too."
8/12/16,5,Just bought my fantastic x4 from Tim green at York. What a pleasure it was to deal with such a professional as tim. Made the experience very enjoyable and kept me up to date throughout. Will definitely buy again from him. Keep up the good work 😀
8/12/16,5,Pre and during communications were great. Professional service by 3 members of the team from reception to the young lady who handled my service. Can't fault them
8/12/16,5,I have received excellent service from the Nottingham Mercedes Branch of Inchcape and I can highly recommend their excellent service
8/12/16,5,"Every time I came in to Mercedes I was made to feel welcomed and comfortable. Great service, hopefully many more years to come."
8/12/16,5,"Major service time for my car. Staff very pleasant and knowledgeable. Although there were a couple of 'advisories', there was no pushyness to get things done and the price was as quoted beforehand.
Car was washed and valeted.
To top it all they loaned me a lovely sports car for the day which made the whole experience very enjoyable! Well done Cooper BMW"
8/12/16,5,"I don't really like going to H A Fox as the cars in the showroom make me drool.

However, I do have to go there for MOT, servicing etc.

I was phoned up ten days before the MOT was due. Booked in immediately. Confirmation email sent to me and then follow up reminders.

Got there, had a quick drool over the cars and left the XF with them.

Returned having passed. The car was spotless. The little carpets in the foot wells had been cleaned to leave stripes (like a posh lawn) which (for some inexplicable reason impressed me).

As ever I thoroughly recommend them."
8/12/16,5,"Having mainly had VW Golfs in the past, now retired I wanted to get a smaller car and saw a 2 year old VW Polo on their website. Arranged a test drive with Gareth for the next day and decided to proceed. I had planned to pay cash but he suggested the finance deal might work better as you get £500 off the price and 2 free services. As you can pay the finance off after 3 months if you wish and still keep these benefits it made sense. He wasn't pushy and left us plenty of time to discuss what we wanted to do. I love the car and I'm sure it will meet our needs going forward. Very friendly and efficient service and I would recommend this dealer."
8/12/16,5,Gave a competitive quote and fitted at a time suit.
8/11/16,5,"I collected my new VW Polo this week from Inchcape VW Macclesfield. I dealt with Danny throughout the purchase process and am extremely happy with the service received and I love my new car.

Danny was very helpful and always returned calls promptly. He called me the day after I collected the car to check that everything was OK.

The whole purchase experience was easy and hassle free. The day of collection was made special - the car was waiting in the showroom under a special cover and I received a bottle of fizz - a lovely extra treat!

I would thoroughly recommend VW Macclesfield to anyone looking for a new car."
8/11/16,5,"Just bought my second used BMW in 2 1/2 years from Tim Hood at Coopers Teeside even though they are 120 mile away. Excellently prepared X3 2.0d auto S.E which was specced virtually as I would have ordered from new, only exception being lack of heated seats which they organised to be fitted prior to collection.First class service from provision of a detailed video of the car prior to reserving it,agreeing a fair p.ex for my old vehicle, lengthy test drive,and taxing the vehicle in my name to allow it to be driven away. Bought a 1 series convertible from them in 2014 and had the same faultless service then which took me back to them this time."
8/11/16,5,"Like most people, I have visited various dealerships over the years for different car makes and models. Simon Barker at Inchcape VW in Chester is a thoroughly nice guy, very helpful, knowledgeable and so I would recommend both he and this particular dealership for anyone looking to buy a new or used VW. Thanks again Simon!"
8/11/16,5,Excellent service as always. Efficient and completed when promised.
8/11/16,5,"First time I have used Tetbury Audi, have to say it was a 1st class experience, couldn't have asked for more. Adam the sales rep answered to all our needs and couldn't have been more helpful."
8/11/16,5,"I recently purchased a new Polo TSi R-line from Inchcape Macclesfield. Having visited the showroom one Sunday morning just to have a""look"" at the new Polo, I consequently left 3 hours later having signed up to purchase one!!! The salesperson dealing with me was Omar and I must say that he was absolutely fantastic! He was attentive and actually listened to what I wanted and I didn't feel under pressure at any time. He phoned when he said he would and I was kept informed of my car's progress from Germany to the docks in Hull and finally to the showroom. The collection day was just amazing and I was made to feel so special with a cover and a huge bow on my car!! I just love my new Polo and would highly recommend Inchcape Macclesfield to anyone thinking of buying a VW. Massive thanks to you Omar, you're a star!!"
8/11/16,4,"I have been a customer of cooper's Sunderland with regard to both car and motorcycle service and have always found the staff to be courteous proffessional and helpful.
Any problems and defects that have been found are always pointed out and shown to me before any work is carried out, and booking a device online is a breeze.
Having some times had problems with the product from the manafacturer as customer ( which happens) can leave you somewhat disheartened , my experience with Cooper's has been excellent with speedy resolvment of the problem.I appreciate everyone's experience and problems are different certainly but I have no qualms and would certainly recommend them to my friends a and family.
Main dealer servicing is never cheap, but that is the customers preference"
8/10/16,5,"I took my car in to Audi @ Bolton, and as soon has I arrived on the forecourt staff were there
To great me and guide into reception.
David look after me and explain everything to me. Nothing was too much trouble. I am extremely satisfied with his customer service and couldnt of asked for more."
8/10/16,4,"The BMW main dealer in Colchester looks after our 1.20i. Had the oil warning light come on together with a burning smell. Tried to check the oil level but couldn't find the dipstick !
The service people at the dealers couldn't find it either. Apparently the car doesn't have one ! Seems strange to me ! Refers to a dipstick in the car manual but there you go ! Did someone steal it ?
Anyway, they put in a litre of oil, checked that nothing was leaking or
burning, cleaned the car and just charged me for the oil. Very good but
still a bit bemused why the car needed the oil as it had only done about 4000 miles since it's last service and oil change."
8/9/16,5,"I intended to buy a car with cash, as is my habit, however, i was encouraged to to use VW finance and because the salesman, Max, was helpful, informative and non pushy, I finally settled on a VW finance package which, upon careful reflection, met my needs very well.

Max's approach was mature, measured, well informed and persuasive by nature of the logical way he presented the options. I felt Max's style was assertive, knowledge based and empowering. He gave me the freedom to challenge his claims, answered my questions fairly and made a sensible exposition of the available options.
Once I had decided on the optimal package for my circumstances, the deal was completed in a relatively timely fashion (although some of the process was unnecessarily tedious) and Max contacted me within 3 days to confirm that 'all was well'.
I am now one week into the ownership of my new 'second hand' car. I have had a couple of teething problems, but generally I take the view that all is well.
My view is that Max delivered a highly professional service, sold me a VW car that is 'fit for purpose' and as the dust settles, I take the view that a competent professional has sold me a good quality car."
8/9/16,5,"Very professional in customer and vehicle service. Pleased with this latest service and with previous services of my cars at VW Twickenham. Always very pleasant and helpful reception who keep you in touch with the service progress. They also send a health check video showing and commentating on the condition of tyres and all other checks done under the car. The car is then given a complimentary clean and vacuum.

R.B"
8/9/16,5,"Rick Blackledge at VW Manchester - professional, personable, quick to identify with our requirements. Informative, with excellent product knowledge, all our questions and queries were answered without a problem. Comprehensive information on purchase options was given but there was no pressure to complete a sale until we were happy. Pick up went without a hitch and a courtesy 'phone call to confirms everything ok received a couple of days later. A very customer focused buying experience."
8/9/16,5,"After booking the service I was contacted the day before to check that all was well. The same individual was there to greet me as I arrived the following day. When I mentioned a rattle, immediately I was invited to take the representative out in the car to demonstrate the source of the noise.
The service was carried out and my passenger seat removed and rattle fixed.
Courtesy vehicle was in very good condition and when I returned to collect I was taken through the feedback and then walked to my vehicle before being sent in my way. I was then contacted the following day to check it was a good experience.
Frankly, I don't think you could have done more.
All I need now is a great deal on an F Pace when I swap and I'll love you forever!"
8/8/16,5,Couldn't have asked for better service by Claire at Canterbury. Excellent customer service from start to finish. Loving my Q5.
8/8/16,5,Excellent Lexus customer service
8/8/16,5,The staff and engineers at this dealership treated me and my car as if we were the only customer that mattered.100% in every way. Thank you.
8/8/16,5,"I purchased a used Range Rover Evoque from Hunters and I found the process so different from previous encounters with car sales folks. The staff were friendly, helpful and responsive, listening to my needs and offering very helpful guidance. I am now the proud owner of a Range Rover Evoque and will be recommending Hunters to my friends and family. Special thanks to Gary S and Joe H."
8/8/16,5,"Polite, accurate, efficient and effective. No issues, great waiting area and a very professional approach to the whole experience. You can buy cheaper services... But you get what you pay for when it comes to servicing your Mercedes. Stick with the dealer and you can be sure the quality is to the right top standards."
8/8/16,5,"Gave my car a good service, sent me a video of the activity explaining any issue. Seemed very no nonsense. The people very courteous, i know some restaurants could benefit from their excellent service engagement"
8/8/16,5,At extremely short notice (I drove in off the street) they repaired a tyre (rather than unnecessarily replace it) and topped up my oil for a great cost and all the while keeping me fully updated as to what they were doing and how long it would take - have to say I was very pleasantly surprised at how efficient they were and the quality of their customer service.
8/8/16,5,"Outstanding customer service. Asif was brilliant- knowledgeable, helpful and polite."
8/8/16,1,"I have been a customer of Cooper Thames Ditton for some 20 years, but their service department has now become disfunctional.

I needed rear shock-absorbers replaced and inspection with standard service items on my X3. Over two weeks ago, I rang and got a service adviser who promised to ring me back ""later today"" with the prices.

Waited a week, nothing.

Rang, again- put through to ""Shirin"". Repeated request. He promised to ring me back ""later today"" with the prices.

You guessed it; nothing.

Rang again three days later. ""Shirin has left the company"". Told that John Young would ring me back.

He does. Repeated request. He promised to ring me back ""later today"" with the prices.

You guessed it; nothing.

Rang, again, select service from menu phone rings, no reply, call dropped.

Rang, again. Ask for Ian Frith, Service Manager. He is ""in a meeting"" but will ring me back.

You guessed it; nothing.

Following day, Rang, again. Ask for Ian Frith, Service Manager. He is ""not in his office"" but will ring me back.

You guessed it; nothing.

Voicemail from Ian Frith finally appears on 5th August.

Returned call, same day. ""He's not in his office"". ""We'll get him to ring you back"".

Asked to speak with John Young. ""He's with a customer"". ""We'll get him to ring you back"".

Nothing from either.

Rang back later that day.

Same replies from reception for both people.

Nothing heard.

Rang this morning, 8th August.

Re Ian Frith. ""He's with a customer."" ""We'll get him to ring you back"".

John Young. ""He's gone on holiday"".

""Could I speak to another service advisor?"" ""Ian Frith would be the best person to talk with""

So far, nothing heard. Sad to see what was an OK dealership go this way.

This is very damaging to BMW's reputation, but clearly they don't care."
8/8/16,5,"Very pleased , this is my 2nd car service at Inchape
Polite , professional, kept me very well informed and a free cuppa
Over the moon will def use again"
8/7/16,5,"Booked my Range Rover in for a service, started with the Hunters website picked the service I needed from the selector list, the prices are shown so that's what you pay. The service team advised me of any issues with the car and priced them up just in case I wanted to know how much. Is convenient for my work so shall be using them for all my servicing and repair needs form now on."
8/6/16,5,I needed a service for my new A5 and felt Bolton Audi were excellent. Efficient service and excellent communication throughout.
8/6/16,4,"Service staff as always, very professional, helpful and friendly. Auto-box loan car supplied as requested. Contacted when car was ready and was given full explanation of all work undertaken. My only negative comment relates to the cost of servicing compared to my Audi."
8/5/16,5,I was very pleased with th service I received and am delighted with my new car.
8/5/16,5,"I found the salesman very helpful, and I feel he found me the right car for me, and the right payment plan. I would definitely recommend friends and family to go there."
8/5/16,5,Dropped my car in for its MOT and Aircon service to Cooper Banstead at my appointment time. Graham notified me that a further service was due in September and arranged for the service to be brought forward instead of having to bring back the car again in 1 month. I was given a completion time when the car would be ready and Graham phoned me personally when the car was ready for pickup. My car was returned to me all clean and shiny. I have no hesitation in recommending them as they always carry out a very good job and are very helpful with solving any issues I have had with my BMW.
8/5/16,5,"I found the purchase of my Merceded A 180 Class car to be very helpful, efficient and thorough. I would recommend the Liverpool Office to anyone. The Salesman was very polite and I look forward to further business with the company.

Judy Johnson"
8/5/16,4,"Helpful staff.

Great car- staff were very knowledgeable about ranges and fetures and helped us get the right car at the right price."
8/5/16,5,"We visited Audi Cheshire Oaks to browse over the used vehicles. A member of staff came to talk to us and enquired about the kind of vehicle we were looking for and what our future needs were.We were then Introduced to Mr Tony Ranson ( Sales Executive) who took us through the list of vehicles we were interested in. Tony was friendly, professional, very knowledgable and treated us on a personal level throughout. We purchased an Audi Q3 and were very impressed with the entire purchasing and handover experience thanks to Tony and other members of the team.
We are happy to recommend Audi Cheshire Oaks."
8/4/16,5,"Had to take my car into the service centre at Stockport yesterday for routine check at Stockport Audi.
The staff are just amazing there – so friendly and welcoming, plus nothing is ever too much for them.
I had my little boy with me, who is 4 and they gave him a remote control car to play with the keep him occupied whilst we waited – this was great, and just shows that Audi do really go the extra mile with the service they deliver.
Special mention to Danielle Emanuel who organised this for me, and nothing is ever too much trouble."
8/4/16,5,"Having used another leading LR dealer for my servicing and repeatedly got shoddy service bordering on criminal, I changed to Hunters Guildford. Although anything on a Range Rover is usually expensive, I always find myself smiling as I pay.
Being in a service industry myself, customer care and the simple enjoyment in the process is vitally important.
The people at Hunters Guildford tick all the boxes."
8/4/16,4,The service was very good. Unfortunately I had two new tyres fitted but the fitter didn't balance them. A few days later whilst driving down the M4 my tyre pressure warning lights came on. Fortunately I was able to find a garage that checked the tyre pressures. Two were two low and two to high.
8/4/16,5,"Couldn't have asked for better service, John your salesman was ver friendly helpful welcoming, must have done his job I came away with my beautiful red beetle I couldn't be happier."
8/4/16,5,"Just purchased car from Terence at Inchape, VW, Manchester

Very good service...informative with little sales flannel. I hate too much sales patter and Terence knew his stuff. Also kept me informed by email of developments as I needed the car at fairly short notice.
The deal was competitive and paperwork relatively painless.

All staff met were helpful from the finance people to the receptionist.

Would highly recommend from this experience. I will now see how the car performs as have not purchased a VW for around 12 years...been with BMW."
8/4/16,5,"Could not fault the quality of service from MB Chester (Inchcape). Easily booked in, collected and returned on the same day. Would highly recommend to anyone and will be returning (for major service due next, *gulp*).

Thanks to all!"
8/4/16,5,"My six series was in for an oil service , I made the booking over the telephone, got the price off coopers servicing tool, on arrival I was looked after by Faith who From previous experience I have found to be extremely customer focused, between booking and arriving the price had changed on the booking tool, wasn't a problem Faith ensured the original price was honoured, I usually take the courtesy car option, this time I opted to wait and utilised the coffee shop and the free wifi, The service was completed within an hour and a half as promised and the car was returned to me washed and vacuumed , I have to say my opinion of Coopers has changed over the last 18 months, historically I found Coopers can be difficult to deal with, my impression is they are now more customer focused , employees can make or break the customers experience a few very positive customer experiences involving interactions with Faith have completely changed my impression of coopers as a business. As a result I would definetly recommend Coopers to friends and work colleagues"
8/3/16,5,"My car went in for its first service.
Brilliant experience. Courtesy call reminder a few day before just to confirm all ok. On the morning prompt service, addressed by name and then remembered my name when I picked the car up.
Excellent all round attention to detail from reception.
Service as part of the plan but still felt dealt with very well.
Car returned washed and vacuumed.
Everything clearly explained."
8/3/16,5,Service was done whilst I waited. Took three hours including washing and vacuuming for a full service (20000 mi). Nice coffee too!
8/3/16,5,"Great service, everything done in the time quoted. Was kept informed by efficient and courteous staff. I waited while the work was done in pleasant surroundings and provided with coffee etc. No complaints and would recommend Cooper Banstead without reservation"
8/3/16,5,I went to vauxwagaon to look at some new cars straight away a man named phil came over to me and was helping me choose the right car gave me a really good deal on my old car to swap in and also a great day on my nee car and i could not be happier i love my new car and when i come to get a new car again i will definitely be sticking with vauxwagon because of phil.
8/3/16,5,1st class service from Inchcape Chester whilst my Golf was having it's 10k service. Personal and highly professional service throughout.
8/2/16,5,I would just like to say a massive thank you to Volkswagen Wirral. I had a fantastic experience with salesman Michael who helped me to get a new car on finance. He was very welcoming and friendly. He was very knowledgable about the vehicle and products and went above and beyond to get me the best deal possible. The customer service here is second to none! This is my second great experience with VW and I hope to be a loyal customer for years to come.
8/2/16,5,"Every now and then something jumps out of the crowd and is better than the rest. Inchcape Mercedes of Nottingham are just that

Having met Gary Booth, senior sales executive and arranged a fair deal for my wife, i was so impressed with the garage, and sales manager Dave Hammond,he really went out of his way to help. Because of this I decided to buy a second car from them. Its the positive attitude and great product and a good deal. The point was that the great service didnt stop with the sale its still exists. A special mention for Sam Taylor who is the resident expert on all electric vehicles. He too has been a great help.
Good garage, good team and great cars."
8/1/16,5,"We were treated with courtesy and respect from the moment we first inquired about Approved Used Audis. Communication was always extremely prompt and helpful and the professionalism shown by our sales executive was truly impressive. In just over a week of dealing with him, we were purchasing a car which we are delighted with. Our experience of Inchcape Audi at Tunbridge Wells certainly exceeded our expectations and has left us as very satisfied customers."
8/1/16,5,"Joanne Wood provided an outstanding thorough service from start to finish. We have just taken delivery of our car yesterday and we are really pleased with it.

Many thanks
Marie from Northwich"
8/1/16,4,Collected my ex demo Golf R on Friday nd can only sy the experience was first class. Billy the sales guy I dealt with collected me from the station and showed me the car and took me for a drive and filled her up with petrol. He was knowledgeable and personable and made the whole experience worthwhile. The only thing that was not right was the office charged me £500.00 for paint protection which I did not ask for or get. Billy was great and has arranged a refund and enquirer how was the car and did I have a good journey home. I would recommend inchcape VW of Chelmsford highly.
8/1/16,5,"Having just completed the purchase of a vehicle from Hunters Southampton I would confirm that the service I received was first class, nothing was too much trouble and the sales representative could not have been more helpful."
8/1/16,5,"I collected my new Golf from Inchcape Stockport last week. An extremely efficient and professional handover experience.I dealt with Peter Wallace Sales representative. Thank you to him and Inchcape for all their help

Paul Kerrigan"
7/31/16,5,"Great service, purchased my new Audi A3 Cabriolet from Tonbridge, had a problem with the specification that was delivered and discussed with Audi 'head office' and they walked away, discussed with Tonbridge and they went the extra mile and resolved the matter, top dealers in my estimation. Have subsequently had the vehicle serviced, and once again faultless, they are not my local Audi dealer, but they are worth the hassle in me making the effort to travel and use them."
7/25/16,5,Everyone at Incape VW Twickenham is always so helpful. It feels like family and I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone!
7/22/16,5,"Arrived in Suffolk for a holiday and our cars warning light flashes to warn we had a puncture... Oh no what should we do, we were due at a wedding during our stay and didn't know the area we were visiting.. I spoke to niall (BMW breakdown) who spoke calmly and reasured me the problem could be resolved... The car was collected by Steve from Hammond's who took us and the car to BMW Colchester.. I had already spoken to Chris in their parts department who ordered the tyre and Amy in the service department arranged for the tyre to be replaced as a priority.. I was covered through BMW Tyre insurance and the only glitch was caused by the policy document being incorrectly set up when the car was purchased two years ago ... After a couple of hours we were on our way and enjoyed the wedding and the rest of the holiday.."
7/22/16,4,"I had a very good service with Coopers BMW cobham branch and would recommend anyone.

I had some issues with the car I purchased but the sales staff did everything they could to resolve the issues very quickly. The service has been outstanding to the point I have already enquired about another vehicle.

Thank you very much."
7/20/16,4,"My first Mercedes and chose the car online, went to view, soon had a test drive booked with Martin who's knowledge was excellent and decided to buy the car. Dealt with professionally and fairly and even got some VIP treatment!! Would recommend them to anyone."
7/19/16,5,"We bought a three month old Touran from Inchcape Swindon. From the moment we made the appointment to view the Touran we were made to feel important and when we walked into the showroom to view the Touran we were greeted with friendly faces and the appointment time I had agreed was met. The test drive was a pleasure, we were not rushed around the block, it was leisurely and lots of the features were explained and demonstrated. Once back at the showroom there was no hard sell and we didn't feel under pressure at all, in fact we left without making the final decision, on the way back we had a discussion and decided we wanted to buy the car. We paid the deposit over the phone and then corresponded through email and phone calls, all of which were professional and pressure free. The day before we collected the car we were sent a video of the car being prepared, this was great! We collected the car the following day, the appointment was on time, the paperwork was all ready for signature, we were given a thorough walk round the car with all controls explained where necessary and we drove away very happy! First Class!"
7/19/16,5,"I've tried a number of MB main dealers and MB Oxford stands out each time. 100% satisfied, couldn't ask for more. :)"
7/19/16,5,14/7/16 We were very satisfied with the speed our query was dealt with and equally the solution provided.
7/18/16,5,"A service second to none. Colin Stephenson the sales person made us feel like we were buying a £100,000 car even tho we purchased a polo match. We will be back again and again.
Others need to take a leaf out of inchcape Chesters book and deliver a no pressure service with value built in."
7/18/16,5,"Very good sale team,went through smoothly as well, spent time going though with you.Thanks to you."
7/18/16,5,"I recently bought a 5 series bmw ,3 yr old,,,they offered a better trade in price than other garages,the car was ready for collection in a couple of days,taxed,valeted,every thing done that we agreed on,collection was a smooth and quick process,I would have no hesitation in recommending this dealership to anyone,I would certainly use them again,all staff very pleasant and extremely helpful."
7/18/16,5,"Having previously been left disappointed having used the BMW dealership in Hull, I thought I would take my new BMW to Cooper BMW Malton. Great choice, the whole process from arranging the booking to checking in and collecting my courtesy car was very efficient. There was no 2 or 3 week wait for a courtesy car neither. I was kept upto date on the progress of the work.
Excellent service and we'll worth the 70 mile round journey."
7/18/16,4,"The cars first service was carried out efficiently, quickly and I had an email with a link to a short film showing underneath my car with tyre measurements etc, all very impressive. However it seems to be standard practice that they will change your radio station and auto controls for lights leaving you having to work out whats changed and how to put it right - driving in the dark realising my lights hadnt come on! Please put my settings back to the way I had them - I will remember to ask them next time!"
7/18/16,5,"I booked my car in for its 2 year service. The lady who took the details was very friendly and courteous, and handled all my questions very competently. On the day, Phill at service reception was efficient and professional, and took me through the work that was covered. He then organised transport into Norwich where we planned to spend the day. When the car was ready in the afternoon, he rang me and arranged transport back to Hunters. No additional work had been needed, so the service contract covered it all and I had nothing further to pay. Throughout, there was a ready supply of drinks, papers and other material to read, etc. Overall, it was an excellent experience and I have no hesitation in recommending them to others."
7/18/16,5,"Inchcape took in my Tiguan for the software update and some other bits and pieces. They had double checked that the appointment was on a suitable day, and reminded me the day before it was due. I have mobility problems, so they came to pick up the car and take it in for me. Inchcape did a health-check while they had the vehicle, producing a short video for me to see online. I received texts to keep me up to date and phones calls from Pippa, my service contact. All the items were sorted and the car returned having been vacuumed and washed - nice. I received a follow up call, a day or so later to check everything was okay, which it was.
From beginning to end, it was good old-fashioned service with a smile. Just the way I like it."
7/18/16,5,"I recently purchased an Audi A6 Avant S-Line from Inchape Audi at Cheshire Oaks. From the first visit to taking collection of the car was handled in an efficient, professional manner and Niall Bytheway was helpful and made the whole experience memorable. The car was immaculately prepared and a pleasure to drive. Niall took the time to show me the basics on the day of collection and I am delighted with the purchase. I would wholeheartedly recommend Niall and Inchcape Audi Cheshire Oaks to anyone."
7/18/16,5,"I got my new VW through Inchcape VW Swindon and I was very impressed with every aspect of the sale.

The sales men (special shout outs to Steve and Mickey) went out of their way to make sure that everything ran smoothly and answered all of my questions and emails promptly.

I am very pleased with my car, the price I paid for it and the service I was given in the garage.

I would highly recommend this garage to anyone who's interested in buying a VW!"
7/15/16,5,Excellent service from start to finish at Exeter. Made the purchase straightforward with no stress or hassle. Thank you to James McJury.
7/15/16,5,"From start to finish, customer service was very good, nothing to much trouble, even when the car was returned for the wheel nuts to be replaced due to the locking nut disappearing, Phil the service man and salesman Gareth were very professional.

Would recommend to friends"
7/13/16,5,"Service was impeccable, efficient and reliable. I thought I was looked after and my deal was generous when compared to other dealers. Product knowledge is thorough and I feel I was informed throughout my purchase, from enquiry through to delivery and even after sales. Particular thanks Charlie Man who was polite, approachable and always there when needed. As desirable as the cars are, I will most surely be visiting Bolton VW for any future purchases!"
7/12/16,5,"Collected my new car. All staff made this a very special event with ribbons, disco lights, and a hand shot video film of me collecting the car to keep. Some might read this and think that it sounds tacky but I would assure you and attest that everything was done with pride, style, and an exceptional level of customer service rarely seen these days . I would not hesitate to reccomend to a friend, and Inchcape Bolton will be my first choice when my car is due for renewal after receiving dire and substandard customer service from the groups sister branch in Manchester on my last purchase!!"
7/10/16,5,I was very happy with my purchase and the service at inchcape bury
7/10/16,5,I have been a Lexus driver & Inchcape client since 2000. I have always received excellent support from the maintenance/service staff and sales team. Nothing is too much trouble and they have always made me feel a most valuable client. I have no hesitation in recommending the team in Guildford.
7/9/16,5,"Have just purchased a Passat estate and part exchanged my car at Inchcape Wirral. We saw Brien Sutton initially to view the cars on offer. There was no pressure or sales patter just friendly informative information and advice given for the car we saw. After deciding to purchase, Brien was on holiday but John Hughes met us for a test drive and again no sales pressure put on us. Nothing was too much trouble for them and we got a good price for our car in part ex. Everything was covered on purchase from road tax to temp insurance even help with extras (boot liner for dogs). After purchase follow up to ensure we were completely satisfied. Various options to purchase were discussed, finance cash etc, but there was no pressure to accept one over the other. Altogether a most pleasant experience and we would most certainly recommend Inchcape Wirral to anyone."
7/7/16,5,"I bought a car recently from West London VW and the person I dealt with there was Tom Garrison. Tom was really down to earth, non pushy and genuine. I felt happy dealing with Tom and am really pleased with my new VW up. I would definitely recommend West London VW. Thanks, Tom!"
7/7/16,5,Very professional from start to finish. We were given help and advice without being put under pressure. Our specific needs were noted and met. Gary Holtom didn't put a foot wrong.
7/7/16,4,From start to finish which was over several weeks of checking website and calling in to showroom the team at Kings Lynn where so helpful and friendly. When we actually chose the vehicle we wanted nothing seemed too much trouble. So a big thank you too the team and Richard Wilson for what is a great vehicle and great service.
7/6/16,5,"Old car was due a service. Having got to Inchcape Southend, decided to 'have a little look'. After a little look and a little chat, became the owner of a new little UP Move. Sorted! No regrets! Great deal!"
7/6/16,5,"I am very happy with the car and the service that I received by the gentleman that sold me the car. The car goes like a dream.
I will recommend the car and the service to anyone.
Excellent service. Thank you"
7/6/16,5,"We purchased our car from Simeon Mitchell, not Mercedes Benz - although he works there!

Simeon did a great job throughout the whole process ensuring we were kept fully informed through the sale

Merc Leicester is not our nearest Benz dealer, but we shall be returning for Service work and future car purchases

Well Done !"
7/6/16,5,"I am really happy with the service I received from Inchcape Telford. We have received excellent service on another occasion so they came fully recommended.
Tom was fantastic and helped get me the best deal possible and the exact car I wanted. Nothing was too much trouble.
All emails and phone calls were very efficient.
Would definitely recommend to a friend."
7/6/16,5,"I recently bought a car from Bart. The process was very easy and there wasn't any pressure from Bart to buy the car. He was very professional and knowledgeable and helpful in resolving a few issues. If you're looking to purchase a Mercedes, head to Mercedes Coventry and ask to speak to Bart."
7/6/16,5,"HA Fox in Guildford have been excellent. Attentive, enthusiastic about their product with good follow up to pre and post sale engagement. If only their sister company Hunters Land Rover on same site had demonstrated a similar approach then they would not have lost a sale for my wife to a competitive dealer. LR should be worried; being a previous owner of 3 x Range Rovers I can genuinely say the new F-Pace is a threat to the “junior” models in the RR range receiving envious glances / positive comments from other RR Sport divers / owners alike."
7/6/16,5,"Bought my wife a new scirocco from VW Stockport.
Dealt with Ian Kramer.
Even though we live 400 miles away, it was a straightforward purchase with excellent communication and consistent attention to detail.
Any emails/phonecalls were quickly returned and a great deal was soon agreed.
Cannot say anything but superb throughout, thanks guys!"
7/3/16,3,The car that I purchased was excellent although one of the tires had seen better days.My problem was I work full time and could only pick the car up on a Sunday.The salesman that I had been dealing with had suddenly left and I had a salesman from Park Lane garage.He was on his own and was not fully up to scratch on my purchase.Not only did he have to deal with me but potential customers coming through the door.It was not his fault but the failure of senior management to address their staffing problem.I like Mini Cars but sales really let Cooper Reading down.
6/29/16,5,Great service and great deal. Really happy.
6/26/16,5,"I bought a used 740d off Malton BMW and the service has been fantastic.

There were a few niggles after purchase and they have promised to sort these for me as soon as I can get the car booked in."
6/25/16,5,"I had my heart set on a Mercedes E class but found the prospect of parting with that sort of money a little bit daunting, from the the moment i stepped foot into Inchcape in Liverpool that all went away. The whole set up there is fantastic, the staff are extremely professional and friendly, the salesman was extremely knowledgeable on every vehicle in there and after describing to him what i wanted from a car he guided me to which choice i should make and at no time put any pressure on me to make the sale. The whole car buying experience was amazing and the car handover at the end was a nice touch, i honestly don't think i will buy from anywhere else in the future. The car is of the highest quality as you would expect and the after sale customer care is second to none. I 100% recommend Inchcape Mercedes Benz of Liverpool to everyone."
6/25/16,3,"Initial dealings were great, communications fantastic, hand over simple but aftersales service is non existent. Have had the vehicle for a week and cannot speak to my sales person compared to beforehand we communicated daily. Emails, calls even on the mobile all is quiet. Slightly disappointing but that's sales, when it's done it's done."
6/23/16,1,Price of the car kept going up each time they called over 2 weeks. Didn't order in the end
6/23/16,5,Great experience and everyone in the team went extra mile to prepare our vehicle to a very high standard. Bravo
6/22/16,5,"Pleasant buying experience provided by Salesman Brian Sutton. Took a little working out but a deal was agreed at a reasonable price, also taking our old car in part exchange."
6/20/16,5,"After a bad experience at another dealership, I had Hunters recommended to me. Hunters offered an excellent service from start to finish and any issues during the process were swiftly dealt with to our satisfaction. I would not hesitate to recommend them to others."
6/19/16,5,Very impressed with the lead up to the actual sale - all promises delivered and all deadlines met. Would recommend HA Fox Jaguar Cheltenham to anybody
6/11/16,3,"Not much of post sale support even for new car. very hard to catch hold of Sales guys via phone or Email even after calling number of times. Even for new car inquiry and sale, it's hard to get hold of the sales guys. Definitely avoid the one in West London, Brentford."
6/2/16,5,"I decided to buy a Jagguar XE in February and this was my first visit toHAFox. I was left alone to browse the cars and then approached in a friendly way by a salesman. Helpful, knowledgeable and not pushy, which impressed me.
When I decided to order the car, the computer systems were clunky and the salesman (Gary) had to walk to the sales office several times before we got the order and finance quotes right.
Since then, after ordering the car in February I had to wait until the end of May before delivery was made.
Top marks for the staff and though, it was only the delivery delay that let me down and that wasn't their fault anyway (as far as I know)."
8/25/15,2,"It seems that Cooper now have a call centre for booking in cars for servicing . That loses the personal touch compared to previously where you spoke to the guys that you get to know over the years when dropping off and picking up your car. More alarming is the 'hard sell' when booking a routine service persuading my wife that the Air conditioning needed recharging as that would make her mini (35k miles) run more efficiently..and additional cost of £90. This raised a concern as I've had BMWs clock up over 200k miles without ever needing an air con service or BMW suggesting it needed one. Indeed the BMW web site says consider a 'debug' IF the air con smells, and a gas recharge IF the aircon is not working correctly. No mention in the Mini manual about the need for a regular service. After raising concerns with the service manager he reluctantly agreed that my wife should have been asked if there were any air con issues before they suggested the work. However, I am not convinced my concerns were understood as it took a lot of discussion for them to see the customers point of view. No apology or recognition their original advice had caused concern. We bought a new car from you and don't deserve this. Coopers, I think you have let your selves down and are shooting your selves in the foot."
